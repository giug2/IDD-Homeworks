<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">We present a database of parliamentary debates that contains the complete record of parliamentary speeches from Dáil Éireann, the lower house and principal chamber of the Irish parliament, from 1919 to 2013. In addition, the database contains background information on all TDs (Teachta Dála, members of parliament), such as their party affiliations, constituencies and office positions. The current version of the database includes close to 4.5 million speeches from 1,178 TDs. The speeches were downloaded from the official parliament website and further processed and parsed with a Python script. Background information on TDs was collected from the member database of the parliament website. Data on cabinet positions (ministers and junior ministers) was collected from the official website of the government. A record linkage algorithm and human coders were used to match TDs and ministers.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Almost all political decisions and political opinions are, in one way or another, expressed in written or spoken texts. Great leaders in history become famous for their ability to motivate the masses with their speeches; parties publish policy programmes before elections in order to provide information about their policy objectives; parliamentary decisions are discussed and deliberated on the floor in order to exchange opinions; members of the executive in most political systems are legally obliged to provide written or verbal answers to questions from legislators; and citizens express their opinions about political events on internet blogs or in public online chats. Political texts and speeches are everywhere that people express their political opinions and preferences.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is not until recently that social scientists have discovered the potential of analyzing political texts to test theories of political behavior. One reason is that systematically processing large quantities of textual data to retrieve information is technically challenging. Computational advances in natural language processing have greatly facilitated this task. Adaptation of such techniques in social science – for example, Wordscore <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Benoit and Laver, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>; Laver, Benoit and Garry, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite> or Wordfish <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Slapin and Proksch, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> – now enable researchers to systematically compare documents with one another and extract relevant information from them. Applied to party manifestos, for which most of these techniques have been developed, these methods can be used to evaluate the similarity or dissimilarity between manifestos, which can then be used to derive estimates about parties’ policy preferences and their ideological distance to each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One area of research that increasingly makes use of quantitative text methods are studies of legislative behavior and parliaments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Giannetti and Laver, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>; Laver and Benoit, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>; Monroe, Colaresi and Quinn, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>; Proksch and Slapin, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">b</span></a>; Yu, Kaufmann and Diermeier, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>; Charbonneau, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>; Galli, Grembi and Padovano, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>; Imbeau, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>; Hopkins and King, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Quinn et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Grimmer, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>. Only a few parliaments in the world use roll-call votes (the recording of each legislator’s decision in a floor vote) that allow for the monitoring of individual members’ behavior. In all other cases, contributions to debates are the only outcome that can be observed from individual members. Using such debates for social science research, however, is often limited by data availability. Although most parliaments keep written records of parliamentary debates and often make such records electronically available, they are never published in formats that facilitate social science research. A significant amount of labor is usually required to collect, clean and organize parliamentary records before they can be used for analytical purposes, often requiring technical skills that many social scientists lack.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of this paper is to present a new database of parliamentary debates to overcome precisely this barrier. Our database contains all debates as well as questions and answers in Dáil Éireann, covering almost a century of political discourse from 1919 to 2013. These debates are organized in a way that allows users to search by date, topics or speaker. More importantly, and lacking in the official records of parliamentary debates, we have identified all speakers and linked their debate contributions to the information on party affiliation and constituencies from the official members database. This enables researchers to retrieve member-specific speeches on particular topics or within a particular timeframe. Furthermore, all data can be retrieved and stored in formats that can be accessed using commonly used statistical software packages.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The database is made available on the Harvard Dataverse at <a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76</a>.</span></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to documenting this database, we also present three applications in which we make use of the new data (Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Analyzing the Content of Parliamentary Debates ‣ Database of Parliamentary Speeches in Ireland, 1919–2013The database is made available on the Harvard Dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). In the first study, we analyze budget speeches delivered by all finance ministers from 1922 to 2008 (Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 The Content of Budget Speeches in Historical Perspective ‣ 3 Analyzing the Content of Parliamentary Debates ‣ Database of Parliamentary Speeches in Ireland, 1919–2013The database is made available on the Harvard Dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>) and show how the policy agenda and ministers’ policy preferences have changed over time (Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Estimation of Finance Ministers’ Policy Positions ‣ 3 Analyzing the Content of Parliamentary Debates ‣ Database of Parliamentary Speeches in Ireland, 1919–2013The database is made available on the Harvard Dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>). In the second application we compare contributions that were made on one particular topic: the 2008 budget debate (Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3 Speakers’ Policy Position in the 2008 Budget Debate ‣ 3 Analyzing the Content of Parliamentary Debates ‣ Database of Parliamentary Speeches in Ireland, 1919–2013The database is made available on the Harvard Dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3</span></a>). Here we demonstrate how text analytics can be used to estimate members’ policy preferences on a dimension that represents pro- versus anti-government attitudes. Finally, we estimate all contributions from members of the 26th government that formed as a coalition between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in 2002. Here we estimate the policy positions of all cabinet ministers on a pro- versus anti-spending dimension and show that positions on this dimension are highly correlated with the actual spending levels of each ministerial department (Section <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 Ministers’ policy position in the 26th government ‣ 3 Analyzing the Content of Parliamentary Debates ‣ Database of Parliamentary Speeches in Ireland, 1919–2013The database is made available on the Harvard Dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>).</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Overview of Database Content</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Parliamentary debates in Dáil Éireann are collected by the Oireachtas’ Debates Office and published as the Official Record. The Debates Office records and transcribes all debates and then publishes them both in printed as well as in digital form. All debates are then published on Oireachtas’ website as single HTML files.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Official records are available at http://debates.oireachtas.ie/Main.aspx (last accessed on 6 August 2017). More detailed information about the Debates Office’s work can be found at http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/Organisation/debatesoffice2.htm (last accessed on 6 August 2017).</span></span></span> At the time of writing, the official debates website contains 549,292 HTML files. The content of all these HTML files forms the data source for our database. It is obviously impossible to hand-code that much information. We therefore wrote a computer script that automated the processing of all files.<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>The computer script consists of multiple syntax files that were written in Python.</span></span></span> This script is able to find all debate contributions and the names of all speakers in each file. In addition, it retrieves the date as well as the topic of each debate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As already explained above, the official online version of the Official Records does not provide information about speakers besides their name. Each speaker’s name is “hard coded” into the HTML files and not linked to the information in the official members database. In addition, speaker names are not coded consistently, hence making it difficult to collect speeches from a particular deputy.<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>More recent parliamentary debates are made available in a dynamic framework on the Oireachtas website. This new interface allows for the retrieval of speaker specific information and to retrieve speeches from a single member. However, this only applies to recent debates since 2007, and not historical debates.</span></span></span> Our goal was to identify every single speaker name that appears in the Official Record and integrate parliamentary speeches with information about deputies’ party affiliation, constituency, age and profession from the official members database into a single database. We therefore used an automated record-linkage procedure to identify every single speaker.<span id="footnote5" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">5</span>Record-linkage is a common technique that is used to link entries from two databases that share the same content but differ in how entries are coded. The basic idea of this procedure is to compare every entry from one database (in our case, the complete list of all speaker names) with every entry from the second database (in our case, the official members database), using some pre-defined algorithms to determine which two entries are most similar to one another. Different record-linkage algorithms have been developed and, after comparing several algorithms, we found the “longest common sub-string” procedure to work particularly well with our data. (See <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Christen (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite> for an overview and comparison of different record-linkage procedures.) The computer code we applied comes from <em id="footnote5.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Febrl</em>, a Python environment that was developed by the ANU Data Mining Group at the Australian National University (https://sourceforge.net/projects/febrl/).</span></span></span></p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The final database contains all debates and written answers from the first meeting of the Dáil on 21 January 1919 through to 28 March 2013, covering every Dáil session that has met during this period. In total, the database contains 4,443,713 individual contributions by 1,178 TDs. The data is organized in a way that facilitates analysis for substantive questions of interest to social scientists.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Analyzing the Content of Parliamentary Debates</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous section, we have explained the structure of the database. In the following three sections we demonstrate how the data can be used for social science research. We do this by demonstrating three different applications. In the first application, we analyze the budget speeches of all finance ministers from 1922 to 2008. Budget speeches are delivered by Finance Ministers once a year, with the exception of emergency budgets. Analyzing this data, we show how policy agendas and ministers’ fiscal preferences have changed over time. In the second application, we construct a data set that resembles a cross-sectional analysis as we retrieve all speeches from one particular year and on one particular topic from our database: the 2008 budget debate. This data structure enables us to estimate the policy positions of all speakers who contributed to the budget debate and to compare how similar or dissimilar their preferences were. We find that policy positions are clustered into two groups: the government and the opposition; but we also find considerable variation within each group. Finally, we take all contributions made during the term of one government and use the data to estimate the policy positions of all cabinet members on a dimension representing pro- versus anti-spending. We demonstrate the validity of estimated policy positions by comparing them against actual spending levels of each cabinet ministers’ department and show that the two measures are almost perfectly correlated with each other.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">3.1 </span>The Content of Budget Speeches in Historical Perspective</h3>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The quantitative analysis of text is primarily based on the proposition that preference profiles of speakers can be constructed from their word frequencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Baayen, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>; Bybee, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite>. This makes word frequencies the most important data input to almost all existing methods of text analysis. Word frequencies can be easily visualized as <em id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">word clouds</em>. These word clouds show the most frequently used words in a text with font size being proportional to frequency of appearance. Despite their simplicity, word clouds can be used as a first descriptive view of the data. Here we look at word clouds for the speeches made by Irish Ministers for Finance. We have extracted the budget speeches of all finance ministers from our database, the first being Cosgrave’s speech in April 1923, and the latest being Lenihan’s speech in October 2008. In total, there are 90 speeches given by 23 different finance ministers for whom we have generated word clouds as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 The Content of Budget Speeches in Historical Perspective ‣ 3 Analyzing the Content of Parliamentary Debates ‣ Database of Parliamentary Speeches in Ireland, 1919–2013The database is made available on the Harvard Dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One way to look at Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 The Content of Budget Speeches in Historical Perspective ‣ 3 Analyzing the Content of Parliamentary Debates ‣ Database of Parliamentary Speeches in Ireland, 1919–2013The database is made available on the Harvard Dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6MZN76." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> is to consider that each individual word cloud panel presents a snapshot into the preference profiles of individual ministers. With taxation being the key instrument of fiscal policy it is unsurprising that the word “tax” is on average the most frequently used word across all Ministers for Finance. We can also discern that frequency of references to “government” has been uneven over time with relatively high usage in the 1960s to 1980s and then subsequent decline (apart from Quinn’s tenure) until the later speeches of Cowen and particularly Lenihan.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">What is more clearly evident is the change in the number of unique words used by different ministers. This reflects the fact that some budget speeches were very short, while others were long and covered many distinct topics. The easiest example is to compare speeches by two consecutive ministers: Cowen and Lenihan. Word clouds reflect the sheer multitude of problems facing the country that needed to be addressed by Lenihan compared to the relatively “quieter” (on average) three budgets delivered by Cowen.</p>

In this model each document is treated as a separate actor’s position and all positions are estimated simultaneously. If a minister maintains a similar position from one budget speech to the next, this means that words with similar frequencies were used over time. At the same time any movement detected by the model towards a position held by, for example, his predecessor, means that the minister’s word choice is now much closer to his predecessor than to his own word usage in the previous budget speech. The identification strategy for the model also sets the mean of all positions to 0 and the standard deviation to 1, thus allowing over time a change in positions relative to the mean with the total variance of all positions over time fixed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Slapin and Proksch, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>.

However, this approach is not easily transferrable to inductive techniques like Wordfish, where there may be substantively different policy dimensions at different time periods, rendering comparison of positions over time challenging, if not impossible. A clear presence of the concept drift issue in Wordfish estimation should be a cautionary note for using the approach with time series data, even though the original method was specifically designed to deal with time-series data as indicated in the title of the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Slapin and Proksch, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>.</p>

For example, Ahern and Reynolds are very similar in their profile but differ from a group consisting of Quinn, McCreevy, Cowen, and Lenihan who are very close to each other. There also appears to be a dramatic shift in agenda between the tenures of Lynch and Haughey (and also during Taoiseach Lynch’s delivery of the budget speech for the Minister for Finance Charles Haughey in 1970). Overall, it appears that topics covered in budget speeches develop in waves, with clear bands formed by, for example, Lenihan, Cowen, McCreevy and Quin; Ahern and Reynolds; MacSharry, Dukes, Bruton, Fitzgerald, O’Kennedy and Colley; R.

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Wordscore uses two documents with well-known positions as reference texts (training set). The positions of all other documents are then estimated by comparing them to these reference documents. The underlying idea is that a document that, in terms of word frequencies, is similar to a reference document was produced by an author with similar preferences. The selection of reference documents furthermore determines the (assumed) underlying dimension for which documents’ positions are estimated. For example, using two opposing documents on climate change would scale documents on the underlying dimension “climate politics”. It has also been shown that under certain assumptions the Wordscore algorithm is related to the Wordfish algorithm used in the previous section <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lowe, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>.</p>

Our interpretation from reading the speeches is that, apart from the budget speech itself, all other speeches largely either attack or defend the incumbent government and to a lesser extent debate the issues of the next budget. We can therefore use contributions during the budget debate as an indicator for how much a speaker is supporting or opposing the current government, here consisting of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. As our reference texts we therefore chose the speeches of Bertie Ahern (Taoiseach) and Enda Kenny (FG party leader). The former should obviously be strongly supportive of the government while the latter, as party leader of the largest opposition party, should strongly oppose it.

Deputy John Gormley, leader of the Green party and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the FF-Green coalition, is estimated to be in the centre of the government cluster.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The government cabinet in parliamentary democracies is at the core of political decision making, yet it is difficult to model intra-cabinet bargaining as the preferences of most cabinet members are unknown. Cabinet decisions are usually made behind closed doors and the doctrine of joint cabinet responsibility prevents ministers from publicly opposing decisions, even if they disagree with them. Using ministers’ speeches and their responses during question times offer a unique opportunity to infer their preferences on policy dimensions of interest. In our final application we estimate policy positions for all cabinet members in the 26th government. The dimension on which positions are estimated represents pro- versus contra-government spending (or spending left-right). We show that estimated positions are highly correlated with departments’ actual spending, which means that estimated positions are not only meaningful but can also be used to predict actual policy-making.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Policy preferences of individual politicians (ministers or TDs in general), are inherently unobservable. However, we have abundant data on speeches made by political actors. The latest developments in automated text analysis techniques allow us to estimate the policy positions of individual actors from these speeches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In relation to Irish political actors such estimation has been hindered by the structure of the available data. While all speeches made in Dáil Éireann are dutifully recorded, the architecture of the data set, where digitized versions of speeches are stored, makes it impossible to apply any of the existing text analysis software. Speeches are currently stored by Dáil Éireann in more than half a million separate HTML files with entries that are not related to one another.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we present a new database of speeches that was created with the purpose of allowing the estimation of policy preferences of individual politicians. For that reason we created a relational database where speeches are related to the members database and structured in terms of dates, topics of debates, and names of speakers, their constituency and party affiliation. This gives the necessary flexibility to use available text scaling methods in order to estimate the policy positions of actors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We also present several examples for which this data can be used. We show how to estimate the policy positions of all Irish Ministers for Finance, and highlight how this can lead to interesting research questions in estimating the determinants of their positions. We show that for some ministers the position can be explained by the country’s economic performance, while the preferences of other ministers seem to be idiosyncratic. In another example we estimate positions of individual TDs in a budget debate, followed by the estimation of policy positions of cabinet members of the 26th Government.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">With the introduction of our database, we aim to make text analysis an easy and accessible tool for social scientists engaged in empirical research on policy-making that requires estimation of policy preferences of political actors.</p>
