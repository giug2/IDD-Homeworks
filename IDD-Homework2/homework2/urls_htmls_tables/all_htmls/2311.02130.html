<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) shows great advantages over conventional two-layer federated learning (FL) in reducing network overhead and interaction latency while still retaining the data privacy of distributed FL clients.
However, the communication and energy overhead still pose a bottleneck for HFL performance, especially as the number of clients raises dramatically.
To tackle this issue, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled HFL system under semi-synchronous cloud model aggregation in this paper, aiming to minimize the total cost of time and energy at each HFL global round.
Specifically, we first propose a novel fuzzy logic based client orchestration policy considering client heterogenerity in multiple aspects, including channel quality, data quantity and model staleness.
Subsequently, given the fuzzy based client-edge association, a joint edge server scheduling and resource allocation problem is formulated.
Utilizing problem decomposition, we firstly derive the closed-form solution for the edge server scheduling subproblem via the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method.
Next, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based algorithm is proposed to tackle the resource allocation subproblem considering time-varying environments.
Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the considered benchmarks regarding HFL performance improvement and total cost reduction.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) has greatly increased the number of intelligent devices and applications, which leads to the humongous amount of data traffic.
To this end, machine learning (ML) becomes necessary due to its great potential in dealing with the extensive amount of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In general, the traditional ML models are trained using a centralized way, which requires a central server to assemble the distributed raw data of users for model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
This centralized paradigm inevitably raises the data privacy concern for users.
In response, a decentralized ML framework called federated learning (FL) was proposed by Google and has been investigated extensively for the past few years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Under the framework of FL, the edge entities, termed clients, are allowed to train a global model collaboratively with local trained model parameters rather than their local private data.
As a direct benefit, the global FL model can be well trained while preserving the data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The implementation of conventional FL normally based on the two-layer framework, which can be divided into two classes, including the client-cloud FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and the client-edge FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
However, the heavy communication overhead and the inferior FL performance are the two major drawbacks for these two types of FL, respectively.
In response, the hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has been proposed recently, which exploits the client-edge-cloud three-layer structure to realize better performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
In HFL, each edge server plays the role of intermediate node which performs the edge model aggregation for local models uploaded by the clients in vicinity.
Next, the aggregated edge models are transmitted by edge servers to the cloud server for global model aggregation when the accuracy threshold for edge model training is satisfied.
As a result, HFL significantly reduces the transmission latency and energy overhead between clients and the remote cloud server.
Besides, the training performance can be guaranteed by the cloud server which is able to orchestra sufficient clients via edge servers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the communication latency and energy overhead become the bottleneck for the further improvement of HFL performance as the number of clients raises.
Given that the densely distributed clients normally can communicate with more than one edge server, the client orchestration, i.e., the association between clients and edge servers, plays a vital role in HFL systems.
Through effective design of client-edge association, more efficient resource allocation among clients can be achieved, leading to improved client-edge communication and further reduction of HFL training time and energy overhead.
Moreover, using non-orthogonal resource-efficient channel access is also helpful in enhancing HFL outcome by reducing access latency and increasing network throughput when communication resources become scarce.
In particular, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> allows multiple clients to transmit their local model parameters simultaneously on the same channel, which has been regarded as a significant enabler to enhance communication efficiency in HFL systems.
Therefore, the investigation towards client orchestration and efficient resource allocation in HFL over NOMA networks deserves to be conducted.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the resource bottleneck in the two-layer FL systems, a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to improve FL performance in existing works, including model compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, client scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> applied network pruning to maximize the FL convergence rate, while the gradient compression method was utilized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> to realize the tradeoff between FL convergence rate and latency.
With the consideration of resource scarceness, client selection is crucial to improve FL performance.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a client orchestration policy based on probability was designed by minimizing the total communication time.
The concepts of reputation and contract were applied to devise the client selection in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, where the trustworthy clients are selected.
Recently, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> considered an emerging criterion, i.e., model staleness, for client scheduling in FL systems, and proposed an age-based selecting policy to achieve better FL performance.
Resource allocation is also vital for the implementation of communication-efficient FL.
To minimize the convergence time of FL, the joint resource allocation and client selection problem was formulated to optimize transmitting power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, computing frequency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and uplink resource block <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Some other works paid attention to the minimization of global FL loss with efficient resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
However, the aforementioned two-layer FL works are not suitable for the large-scale systems, owing to the long training latency and heavy energy overhead.

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By taking advantage of the conventional two-layer FL, the HFL with the client-edge-cloud structure was proposed and studied extensively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, considering the edge aggregation interval control, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> investigated the multi-objective optimization problem of global loss and training latency in a HFL system.
Differently, the convergence bound for one HFL round was analyzed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and the joint resource allocation and edge server scheduling problem was investigated.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the client-edge association scheme was carefully designed to achieve efficient resource allocation, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> considered the heterogeneous data distribution among clients.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> took model quantization into account to analyze the HFL convergence bound, which was then applied to the design of edge and cloud model aggregation interval.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve a further improvement of training performance and communication efficiency, several promising technologies have been considered in HFL systems, including NOMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
More specifically, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> applied NOMA in HFL systems and formulated a joint problem regarding client orchestrarion and resource allocation.
Considering the willingness of clients to transmit their local models during HFL training, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a blockchain-based incentive scheme to achieve better performance.
The rapid development of DRL makes the integration of DRL with HFL more prevalent.
A two-layer deep Q-leaning based incentive mechanism was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> to motivate clients for aggregation, which contributes to the high-quality HFL model training.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based algorithm to minimize the HFL global loss.
Nevertheless, none of the above HFL works touched upon the client-edge association under multiple criteria, hence failing to balance the client heterogenerity, which limits them in practical wireless scenarios.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From above observations, HFL shows great superiority than traditional two-layer FL in reducing training latency and energy cost.
Nevertheless, there is still a bottleneck of communication and energy overhead for the further improvement of HFL performance when deploying in large-scale systems.
Intelligent client orchestration is one of the solutions to address this issue.
However, the client-edge association schemes in the HFL literature only depend on a single criterion and fail to consider the client heterogeneity in multiple aspects, e.g., data, model and communication quality, which makes them unsuitable in practical wireless networks.
Hence, it is essential to design multi-criteria based client-edge association schemes for realizing communication-efficient HFL systems.
Besides, NOMA shows great potential in addressing the resource scarceness issue via improved access and communication efficiency, which is beneficial to facilitate HFL convergence.
Although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> has conducted the research on NOMA-enabled HFL system, the impact of NOMA on HFL performance was not analyzed.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by above analysis, we propose a novel NOMA enabled HFL system in this paper, and design a multi-criteria client orchestration policy based on fuzzy logic.

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2.5" class="ltx_p">In NOMA, the interference among clients is introduced due to transmitting simultaneously over the same channel.
To tackle this issue, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) approach has been commonly adopted in NOMA-enabled systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Particularly, for the uplink NOMA transmission, by regarding other signals as interference, the receiver decodes the most powerful signal first.
After subtracting the decoded signal from the superpositioned signal, the receiver subsequently performs decoding to the second strongest signal in the same manner.
This approach proceeds until decoding all signals successfully.
Note that the design of an optimal SIC decoding order is beyond the scope of this paper.
Thus, for simplicity of analysis, we make assumption that the decode order is decided based on the received power, i.e. <math id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.9" class="ltx_Math"

The synchronous manner for the edge model aggregation is reasonable as each edge server’s coverage is limited, leading to the moderate time consumption for each client.
In this case, the straggler problem will not degrade HFL performance severely.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">After reaching the edge accuracy, the aggregated edge model parameter is uploaded by each edge server to the cloud for global model aggregation.
As compared to the client-edge phase, the edge-cloud phase has a much lower communication burden, we adopt the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) transmission at this stage.
Note that the edge servers have relatively abundant resources for computing and communicating compared with clients.
Thus, the corresponding resource allocation issue is not the focus of this paper.
For ease of analysis, we omit the calculation of achievable data rate for edge servers.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.7" class="ltx_p">We consider a semi-synchronous cloud model aggregation mechanism in this paper, due to the following two aspects.
On the one hand, if we adopt the absolute synchronous cloud aggregation, the long transmission delay may cause severe straggler problem, which will degrade the HFL performance.
On the other hand, if the absolute asynchronous cloud aggregation manner is adopted, the cloud server would frequently communicate with the edge servers with better computing capability and communicating conditions, which may not only lead to heavy communication overhead but also lead to the overfitting risk for the global HFL model.
The semi-synchronous cloud aggregation offers a balanced tradeoff to address these issues.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The association between clients and edge servers is designed in this section, which is vital in enhancing the HFL performance, especially in large-scale systems.
Note that the number of clients far exceeds that of edge servers in our proposed HFL system.
In this case, only a subset of clients can associate with the edge server because of the limited communication resources.
Besides, we consider that each client can be orchestrated by different edge servers, but it can only associate with one edge server during one global iteration.
Therefore, it requires us to carefully design the client-edge association to achieve better HFL performance.
Previous client-edge association schemes mainly depend on a single factor or criterion, such as the distance between the edge server and clients, the data distribution of clients and so forth.
However, such single-criterion based client-edge association schemes fail to simultaneously balance the client heterogenerity in the system, which inevitably degrades the HFL performance.
Differently, in this paper, a multi-criteria based client-edge assocation scheme according to the fuzzy logic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> is proposed, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-A Fuzzy Input ‣ III Fuzzy logic based client-edge association ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, by simultaneously considering the client-edge channel quality, the data quantity of client and the local model staleness.
The details of the fuzzy logic based client-edge association scheme are presented as follows.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This input variable indicates the client-edge communication environment.
In our proposed HFL system, the client with poor CQ is not supposed to transmit its local model for edge aggregation, because it will cause long transmission delay under the synchronous model aggregation manner, which could degrade the HFL performance.
Thus, CQ is one of the key factors needed to be considered when designing the client-edge association scheme.
Note that in wireless communications, the CQ is affected by various factors.
In this case, the CQ of a client in HFL cannot be determined merely by the distance from the client to the edge server.
In other words, even if the client is located closely to the edge server, the CQ between them may still be unsatisfied due to the fading effect.
In this case, we are supposed to choose CQ rather than the distance as a factor for the client-edge association design.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To improve HFL training performance, it is essential to select as many clients as possible, especially considering heterogeneous data distribution among clients.
In this case, sufficient data samples can be utilized to train the global HFL model.
Nevertheless, we consider that the number of clients far exceeds that of edge servers in the proposed system, leading to few selected clients at each global round.
Thus, to achieve better HFL performance, we need to consider how we can choose the clients with more data samples.
Hence, DQ is another essential factor needed to be considered when designing the association scheme between the clients and the edge servers.</p>

The clients with higher MS have a higher probability to be associated with the edge server, as their data samples are more informative to update the global model.
Therefore, the average MS of the entire HFL system can be guaranteed to be relatively low, which benefits the fast convergence of HFL.</p>

Note that in this paper, we utilize the Max-Min method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> to derive one rule from multi-criteria and combine multiple rules.
To be specific, we choose the minimum value of the three membership functions as the degree of the fuzzy rule.
When multiple rules correspond to the same output, we choose the rule with maximum degree.</p>

Besides, considering the convex constraint (<a href="#S4.E28.5" title="In 28 ‣ IV-B2 Solution of 𝑧_𝑚 ‣ IV-B Edge Server Scheduling ‣ IV Joint edge server scheduling and optimal resource allocation ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">28e</span></a>), the optimization problem (<a href="#S4.E28" title="In IV-B2 Solution of 𝑧_𝑚 ‣ IV-B Edge Server Scheduling ‣ IV Joint edge server scheduling and optimal resource allocation ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">28</span></a>) belongs to a convex problem.
Hence, we can utilize the Lagrange dual method to obtain the optimal solution.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Owing to the coupled optimization variables in (<a href="#S4.E36.1" title="In 36 ‣ IV-C Resource Allocation ‣ IV Joint edge server scheduling and optimal resource allocation ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">36a</span></a>), it is still challenging to obtain the optimal solutions utilizing traditional optimization methods.
Moreover, when considering the dynamic channel environment in our proposed system, it is too challenging for the traditional methods to obtain the solutions.
In this case, the DRL method is an idea candidate, which has a low optimization complexity and can interact with the dynamic environment to achieve better performance.
Since problem (<a href="#S4.E36" title="In IV-C Resource Allocation ‣ IV Joint edge server scheduling and optimal resource allocation ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">36</span></a>) can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the continuous action and state spaces, we adopt the DDPG-based approach to achieve optimal resource allocation in this paper.
Note that in DDPG, all the associated clients are treated as one agent, as they all have the same optimization goal.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.8" class="ltx_p">Next, to have a better understanding towards DPPG, we first introduce the concept of MDP briefly.
According to the theory of Markov process, MDP can be regarded as an optimal decision process with respect to a stochastic dynamic system.
More specifically, given the observed state, a new decision can be made by the agent in MDP to transfer the state and calculate the probability of state transition.
Then, the new decisions are made by the decision maker according to the new observed state.
The process of MDP can be described mathematically as <math id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\left\{{S,A,R,P}\right\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml"><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.2.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml">{</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">S</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml">A</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3.cmml">R</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.2.4" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.4" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.4.cmml">P</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.2.5" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4b"><set id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.5.2"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑆</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2">𝐴</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3">𝑅</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4.4">𝑃</ci></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.4c">\left\{{S,A,R,P}\right\}</annotation></semantics></math>, in which <math id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="S" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">S</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">S</annotation></semantics></math> is the state of the agent, <math id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">A</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1">𝐴</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1c">A</annotation></semantics></math> denotes the available action for the agent under <math id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="S" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml">S</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1">𝑆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1c">S</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S4.SS3.p2.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="R" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml">R</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1">𝑅</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.5.m5.1c">R</annotation></semantics></math> denotes the achievable reward for transferring into the next state and <math id="S4.SS3.p2.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.cmml">P</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1">𝑃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.6.m6.1c">P</annotation></semantics></math> represents the probability of state transition when the agent takes action <math id="S4.SS3.p2.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.7.m7.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.cmml">A</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.7.m7.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1">𝐴</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.7.m7.1c">A</annotation></semantics></math> under state <math id="S4.SS3.p2.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="S" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.8.m8.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.8.m8.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.8.m8.1.1.cmml">S</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.8.m8.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.8.m8.1.1">𝑆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.8.m8.1c">S</annotation></semantics></math> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.

We consider two data distribution scenarios in our simulation, including the independent and identically distributed (IID) data distribution and the non-IID data distribution.

It can be found that some clients which are not very close to the selected edge servers are still orchestrated due to their sufficient training data and their stale local models.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed fuzzy based client-edge association (FCEA) scheme in improving HFL performance, we consider the following three benchmarking schemes, including the random client-edge association (RCEA) scheme, the greedy client-edge association (GCEA) scheme and the OMA scheme.
Specifically, in RCEA, the association between clients and edge servers is designed in a random manner, while in GCEA, the client with the strongest channel gain builds association with the edge server, which reflects the single-criterion association.
For the OMA scheme, the OMA transmission is considered between clients and the associated edge server, where the fuzzy based association is performed.</p>

It can be observed that as HFL global round increases, before reaching the training convergence, there is a surge trend for the learning accuracy of all schemes.
Moreover, the proposed FCEA scheme always achieves superior learning accuracy in comparison with other three benchmarks.
This is because our scheme balances the client heterogenerity for client-edge association by accounting for three properties of clients.
The global loss of HFL on IID data is presented in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-B Performance of HFL ‣ V Simulations and analysis ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
As HFL global round grows, the HFL training loss decreases dramatically until convergence.
It can also be observed that our proposed FCEA scheme can realize the lowest global HFL loss among the considered schemes.
Therefore, it is validated that the proposed FCEA scheme can improve HFL performance.
Besides, Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B Performance of HFL ‣ V Simulations and analysis ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-B Performance of HFL ‣ V Simulations and analysis ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> show that the figures for the OMA scheme fluctuate severely before reaching convergence, which is owing to insufficient orchestrated clients at each round.
Under this circumstance, more training rounds are required to achieve HFL convergence using enough data.
At HFL convergence, the OMA scheme with fuzzy-based association can still achieve better performance in comparison with the RCEA and GCEA schemes.</p>

Owing to the property of non-IID data, we can observe that both the HFL performance and robustness drop a lot comparing with the figures in Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B Performance of HFL ‣ V Simulations and analysis ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-B Performance of HFL ‣ V Simulations and analysis ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
Moreover, it requires more global rounds to achieve HFL convergence with non-IID data distribution.

This is because the client-edge association with multiple criteria is considered in our scheme, which is more beneficial for the improvement of HFL performance.
We can also observe that the OMA scheme owns the worst HFL convergence performance because of the insufficient associated clients at each round.
Thus, the superiority of NOMA-enabled HFL system can be demonstrated.</p>

It is obvious to find out that as HFL training round rises, the average MS figures of all schemes increase, while our proposed FCEA scheme achieves the lowest MS value in comparison with other schemes.
This is because in our proposed FCEA scheme, the MS is regarded as one of the factors for client-edge association.
Under this circumstance, the system average MS value can be guaranteed at a relatively low level, which is beneficial for the HFL convergence.
Specifically, the low level average MS in HFL systems guarantees the local models to be fresh enough for model aggregation and more types of data can be utilized for HFL training especially in the scenarios with non-IID data distribution.
In Fig. <a href="#S5.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ V-C Performance of Average MS ‣ V Simulations and analysis ‣ Client Orchestration and Cost-Efficient Joint Optimization for NOMA-Enabled Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>, we can also observe that the RCEA scheme and the GCEA scheme realize almost the same average MS value as HFL training.
This is because in these two schemes, the MS is not considered in the design of client-edge association.
Nevertheless, the average MS value of the OMA scheme increases more quickly in comparison with other three schemes because of the much less orchestrated clients at each HFL round.
Under this circumstance, the average MS cannot be guaranteed even considering this factor in the design of association.</p>

More specifically, in the RRA scheme, the power and computation resource are allocated randomly for clients, while the power and computation frequency are fixed in the FPA scheme and the FCA scheme, respectively.

As the training episode increases, the figures for schemes except the RRA scheme have the gradual decreasing trend, which verifies the effectiveness of efficient resource allocation to the total cost reduction.
Particularly, for the RRA scheme, both power and computation resource are allocated randomly without considering optimization, hence leading to the fluctuation of its figure.
For the other three schemes with the consideration of resource allocation optimization, it can also be found that our proposed DDPG-RA scheme realizes the lowest total cost compared with the FPA scheme and the FCA scheme.
It validates the superiority of the joint optimization of the power and computational resource allocation.
In the comparison of the FPA scheme and the FCA scheme, we find that the FPA scheme can achieve less total cost than the counterpart, which is determined by the weighting factors in the total cost definition.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied the multi-criteria client orchestration and joint optimization of edge server scheduling and resource allocation in a NOMA enabled HFL system under semi-synchronous cloud model aggregation.
The application of NOMA in HFL systems ensures the enhanced communication efficiency.
We divided the system implementation into two phases, i.e., the client-edge phase and the edge-cloud phase, and formulated the corresponding time and energy cost, respectively.
A fuzzy logic based client-edge association policy was first proposed to balance the client heterogenerity in multiple aspects.
Then, we formulated the total cost minimization problem and decomposed it into edge scheduling and resource allocation two subproblems.
The former subproblem was solved effectively through the PDD-based algorithm, and a closed-form solution of edge server scheduling was obtained.
Considering the time-varying communication environment, we developed a DDPG-based algorithm to achieve efficient resource allocation among orchestrated clients at each edge server.
Through extensive simulation results, we demonstrated that the proposed schemes own superior performance in improving HFL performance and reducing total cost.</p>
