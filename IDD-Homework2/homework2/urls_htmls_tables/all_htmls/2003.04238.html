<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Researchers are often interested in linking individuals between two datasets that lack a common unique identifier. Matching procedures often struggle to match records with common names, birthplaces or other field values. Computational feasibility is also a challenge, particularly when linking large datasets. We develop a Bayesian method for automated probabilistic record linkage and show it recovers more than 50% more true matches, holding accuracy constant, than comparable methods in a matching of military recruitment data to the 1900 US Census for which expert-labelled matches are available. Our approach, which builds on a recent state-of-the-art Bayesian method, refines the modelling of comparison data, allowing disagreement probability parameters conditional on non-match status to be record-specific in the smaller of the two datasets. This flexibility significantly improves matching when many records share common field values. We show that our method is computationally feasible in practice, despite the added complexity, with an R/C++ implementation that achieves significant improvement in speed over comparable recent methods. We also suggest a lightweight method for treatment of very common names and show how to estimate true positive rate and positive predictive value when true match status is unavailable.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The record linkage problem of identifying unique individuals between two datasets without common unique identifiers arises in various applied settings. Typically, linkage, also called matching, is performed to create a new, combined dataset that can be used to answer economic and policy questions.

</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Record linkage problems frequently require dealing with what we refer to as the common name problem, which is that many records (usually people) share very common names, birthplaces or other field values and are harder to link than records with uncommon names and field values. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Newcombe <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\BOthers</span>. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\APACyear</span>1959</a>)</cite>, in an early example of computer record linkage, addressed this problem by manually constructing probability weights to adjust for frequency of common names. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Winkler (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\APACyear</span>1988</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\APACyear</span>1989</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yancey (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\APACyear</span>2000</a>)</cite> proposed frequency-based weights for modern frequentist matching procedures. <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">fastLink</span> includes an option for ex-post reweighting by first name frequency. Alternative string distance metrics that take frequency into account, such as the “soft” TF-IDF measure of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cohen <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\BOthers</span>. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\APACyear</span>2003</a>)</cite>, have also been proposed for dealing with the issue as it applies to character fields like first and last name, though this imposes considerable computational cost in large matchings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we outline a statistical model for record linkage which allows for record-specific heterogeneity, a refinement of the model of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\APACyear</span>2017</a>)</cite>. In particular, disagreement probability parameters conditional on non-match status are allowed to vary by record in the smaller of the two datasets, mitigating the common name problem by giving the model flexibility over every field value that appears in the data. In an application, we link recruitment data from veterans of the Union Army in the US Civil War to full count 1900 US Census data. “True” matches, made manually by experts using additional information, are used to evaluate performance. Our significant relaxation of the model, which adds computational expense, leads to identifying more than 50% more true matches than in a baseline Bayesian model without record-specific disagreement parameters, when holding accuracy constant.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, we propose an alternative, lightweight method for treatment of very common names. We modify comparison data to include an indicator for very common names that otherwise spuriously produce exact matches in record pairs. This modification slightly improves matching performance in the Union Army application, relative to a baseline model, and adds very little computational expense. It is useful when other methods for dealing with common names, such as record-specific parameters, are computationally prohibitive. The method can be used in combination with record-specific parameters, though we find it does not further improve matching performance in that case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We implement a version of the Gibbs sampler of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\APACyear</span>2017</a>)</cite> to draw from the posterior, achieving much higher computation speed than in the original implementation, mainly by drastically reducing memory requirements related to comparison data (see Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Implementation ‣ Fast Bayesian Record Linkage With Record-Specific Disagreement Parameters The author thanks Jiaying Gu and Shari Eli, as well as Martin Burda, En Hua Hu and others for their help and suggestions.

Costa, principal investigator." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). We also achieve speed comparable to that of frequentist methods, even when record-specific parameters are used, suggesting that estimating large matchings using a fully Bayesian approach that enforces a bipartite matching and allows record-specific parameters can be practical using commonly available computational resources.</p>

The Jaro-Winkler distance is a standard string distance in record linkage, and roughly counts the number of edits needed to transform one string to the other, while weighting agreement in the first letter more heavily. Numeric fields such as birth year are compared by absolute difference, then discretized to the desired number of levels. Finally, for categorical fields such as state of birth, a binary measurement for exact agreement (1) or disagreement (2) is taken.</p>

However many records in a block are coded as having very common first names, an even higher proportion of record <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">pairs</em> with exact agreement on first name will be marked as very common, because the number of such pairs rises in the product of the number of such records in each dataset. This can lead to problems identifying the probability of matching conditional on non-spurious exact agreements, because of a lack of data.

The utility of this encoding is to allow the final step of obtaining a point estimate to be viewed as a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP). We set all non-matches to 0 for simplicity and because it reduces computational cost, but switching between encodings is trivial in cases where solving an LSAP is necessary to produce a point estimate (see Section <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 Loss function ‣ 3 Record-specific Bayesian Method ‣ Fast Bayesian Record Linkage With Record-Specific Disagreement Parameters The author thanks Jiaying Gu and Shari Eli, as well as Martin Burda, En Hua Hu and others for their help and suggestions.

The distances were discretized into seven bins, with cutpoints at 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.22, 0.3, and 0.45. Reducing the number of bins or moving the cutpoints does not significantly affect the estimated matching. Comparisons for birth year are absolute differences between years, discretized in four bins, with cutpoints at 1.5, 2.5 and 4.5. Birthplace comparisons are a binary variable indicating whether there is an exact match.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data is not blocked on year or state of birth. We block on initials, grouping them based on frequency and common errors. Blocks for first name are, where letters indicate initials included in the block, AEIOUY, BFP, CKQSXZ, DT, GJ, Jo, HMN, LR, and VW. The Jo block includes men whose first name begins with Jo and was necessary because of the large number of Johns and Josephs. Blocks for last name are AEIOUY, B, CKQX, DT, FP, GJ, H, LNR, M, SZ, VW. This scheme yields 99 roughly equally-sized blocks which contain among them approximately 754 million pairs of records.</p>

The AEIOUY AEIOUY block is a typical block in which the baseline model converged, while the VW FP block is made up mainly of men with the first name William, and in which the baseline model struggled to make links. Our record-specific method estimates more matches than the baseline in both blocks, but the difference is starker in the VW FP block, where the mode for the number of matches in the baseline model is zero. The record-specific method overcomes the problem of spurious exact agreement in blocks dominated by common names discussed in Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS2" title="3.2.2 Likelihood ‣ 3.2 Model ‣ 3 Record-specific Bayesian Method ‣ Fast Bayesian Record Linkage With Record-Specific Disagreement Parameters The author thanks Jiaying Gu and Shari Eli, as well as Martin Burda, En Hua Hu and others for their help and suggestions.

Models of comparison data can be misspecified when there is spurious exact agreement between record pairs with very common field values, and asymmetry in datafile sizes can lead to large numbers of false positives. At the same time, Bayesian methods are computationally demanding, leading to a steep tradeoff between speed and flexibility.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed method and implementation push through that tradeoff by speeding up computation by an order of magnitude. Parallel computing methods could be used to reduce computation time further. Our more flexible Bayesian model allows for record-specific disagreement parameters and can yield significantly better results along the precision/recall frontier, particularly in large matching problems where many records have common field values. However, it is still limited by the need for manual blocking; an “end-to-end” procedure that incorporates blocking into the model, in the spirit of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Marchant <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\BOthers</span>.
