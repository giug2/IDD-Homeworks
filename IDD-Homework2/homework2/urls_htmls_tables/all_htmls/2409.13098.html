<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Soccer attracts the attention of many researchers and professionals in the sports industry. Therefore, the incorporation of science into the sport is constantly growing, with increasing investments in performance analysis and sports prediction industries. This study aims to (i) highlight the use of complex networks as an alternative tool for predicting soccer match outcomes, and (ii) show how the combination of structural analysis of passing networks with match statistical data can provide deeper insights into the game patterns and strategies used by teams. In order to do so, complex network metrics and match statistics were used to build machine learning models that predict the wins and losses of soccer teams in different leagues. The results showed that models based on passing networks were as effective as “traditional” models, which use general match statistics. Another finding was that by combining both approaches, more accurate models were obtained than when they were used separately, demonstrating that the fusion of such approaches can offer a deeper understanding of game patterns, allowing the comprehension of tactics employed by teams relationships between players, their positions, and interactions during matches. It is worth mentioning that both network metrics and match statistics were important and impactful for the mixed model. Furthermore, the use of networks with a lower granularity of temporal evolution (such as creating a network for each half of the match) performed better than a single network for the entire game.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The prediction of soccer match results has been a topic of great interest in the scientific community and the sports industry. Various approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, typically based on game statistics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, player and team performance analyses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and other relevant metrics. However, many of these approaches are limited in their effectiveness and struggle to deal with the complexity and dynamics of player and team interactions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">One promising approach that has gained traction is the application of network science to soccer. This involves the construction of passing networks, which provide a detailed representation of player interactions and game dynamics. Studies have demonstrated that analyzing these networks can yield valuable insights into team strategies and performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. For instance, Buldú et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> used network science to analyze Guardiola’s FC Barcelona, revealing distinct structural patterns in their passing network that differs from other teams, thus explaining their great performance through network metrics. Similarly, Gyarmati et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> introduced the concept of “flow motifs” to characterize significant pass sequence patterns in soccer teams. Their analysis demonstrated that, while most teams employ a homogeneous playing style, unique strategies do exist.<span id="S1.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text">In addition to network science, machine learning has been extensively explored for predicting soccer outcomes. Techniques such as gradient-boosted trees have been employed to learn from relational data and predict match results with significant accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Machine learning models can leverage a variety of features, including historical match statistics and player performance metrics, to forecast future outcomes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.<span id="S1.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text">This paper aims to bridge these two fields by evaluating whether the analysis of passing network structures can enhance the effectiveness of predictive models for soccer match outcomes. To achieve this goal, soccer match data was collected, and passing networks were constructed to analyze player interactions. Complex network metrics were extracted and used as inputs for machine learning models. The effectiveness of these network metrics was compared to traditional models that rely solely on previous game statistics. Furthermore, the combination of network metrics and traditional features was tested to explore potential synergies that could further enhance the predictions of soccer match outcomes. In summary, our results contribute to the field of soccer match outcome prediction by assessing whether the analysis of passing network structures can lead to more effective predictive models. Our findings may provide valuable insights for applying these techniques in other domains and contribute to the improvement of this research field.<span id="S1.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For this research, soccer match data was collected from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This dataset consists of 1941 soccer matches, including games from the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2016 UEFA European Championship, and the 2017–2018 seasons of Spanish, Italian, German, English, and French leagues. However, due to the modeling approach used, which considers only wins or losses, games resulting in draws were removed, resulting in a total of 1470 matches. In Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Analysis Including Draws ‣ Predicting soccer matches with complex networks and machine learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a> we evaluate the performance of our approach when draws are included in the dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Each match is recorded in an event-based format, which includes temporal, spatial, and event type information, i.e., the game time and the field coordinates where the events occurred are included. The event data contains detailed information about each interaction between players, where each row in the dataset represents a specific event such as passes, shots on goal, and fouls, including the information of which players performed these events and specific characteristics such as successful or unsuccessful actions, for example, allowing for a more detailed analysis of game dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This dataset is suitable for the research as it enables the construction of the necessary pass networks to analyze player interactions. Additionally, the variety of teams and competitions included in the data allows for a more robust evaluation of the prediction approaches in a diverse and realistic scenario, including separate tournament-based analyses.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">II.2 </span>Construction of passing networks</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Passing networks are structures that consider the organization of a team as the result of interaction among its players, thus creating passing networks. These networks are directed (edges between players are unidirectional), weighted (the weight of the edges is based on the number of passes between players), spatial (the Euclidean position of the ball and players is highly relevant), and temporally evolving (the network continuously changes its structure) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are three main types of passing networks, as explained in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>: “player passing networks”, where each node corresponds to a player on the team; “pitch passing networks”, where each node corresponds to a delimited region of the field where players occupy; and “pitch-player passing networks”, which are a combination of the previous two types. In all three approaches, the weight of the edges corresponds to the number of passes between the respective nodes. In this work, we used the first option (player passing networks).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The passing networks were constructed individually for each team, and two different chronological granularities were tested: one network for the entire game and two distinct networks, one for each half of the game. The average field position of each node (player) was also calculated within the given time interval.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is important to mention that only the initial 22 players of each game were considered in the construction of the networks. The nodes of substitute players were transferred to the players they replaced in order to maintain a consistent structure of 11 nodes for each team in all matches. Although this approach may suppress some team characteristics that change with substitutions, this method was adopted to maintain a consistent structure across all matches, following the methodology proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At the microscale, the importance of each player is assessed individually in the network using metrics such as node degree (the number of passes given and received by each player), eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, among others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">At the mesoscale, the focus is on analyzing the role of groups of players that are strongly connected to each other. The analysis of network motifs has shown how the abundance of passes between groups of three/four players can be related to both a team’s success <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and the identification of leaders in the passing network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, at the macroscale, the metrics aim to provide information about the style and performance of teams as a whole, such as the position of the network centroid, player dispersion index, and team’s average degree.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The following metrics were chosen and used to evaluate the passing networks.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">IV </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our results indicate that both the model based on standard metrics and the model on network measurements demonstrate similar performance in predicting soccer match outcomes, showing that it is possible to shift from the ”traditional” approach to predicting winners and achieve similar results. However, the mixed model that combines both approaches showed an improvement compared to the traditional model, with features from both approaches having significant impact and importance in predicting outcomes. Additionally, these results suggest that teams’ strategies change throughout the match, as evidenced by the higher accuracy of the mixed model when considering separate networks for each half compared to a single network for the entire game.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another important finding is that different leagues do not exhibit significant differences in their characteristics, indicating that models trained on one league can be used to predict outcomes in another league. This discovery can be useful for teams seeking insights about their opponents or for the sports betting market to predict results across different leagues. <span id="S4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">The fact that the English league emerged as the most predictable suggests that the model successfully captured the specifics characteristics and patterns of those matches, resulting in better predictability. However, the clustering analysis revealed that overall playing styles among the analyzed countries do not exhibit significant differences, which supports the notion that a model trained on one league can generalize to others despite variations in predictability levels.<span id="S4.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text">One of the main limitations that may have impacted the quality of the predictions was the size of the available dataset, which was restricted to a single season from five of the most popular leagues in the world, along with a World Cup and a European cup. Additionally, we have focused only on predicting wins and losses of games, without considering other outcomes such as draws. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, our study is primarily focused on predicting results for the most popular leagues in Europe, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other regions or less popular leagues. The analysis also relied on historical data and did not consider factors such as team changes, coaching changes, player injuries, or other unpredictable circumstances that may occur during a tournament.<span id="S4.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text">There are many other scenarios that could be explored with the methods presented here. For instance, one could decrease the temporal granularity, meaning to analyze the data in smaller intervals than a complete half (45 minutes), such as 15-minute intervals for each network. This would provide a better understanding of how game patterns and strategies evolve over time. It would also be interesting to incorporate draws into the analysis. While the choice to focus only on wins and losses was made to simplify the model and achieve better performance, the inclusion of draws can be valuable in understanding how teams perform in situations of equality. Additionally, a promising extension would be to incorporate the information of motifs, which are frequent subgraphs in a network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The study of motifs can help identify interaction patterns between players that are crucial for team performance. Lastly, one could also employ different machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, and other boosting-based models like AdaBoost.<span id="S4.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

<div id="A1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we revisit our analysis by incorporating matches that resulted in draws into our predictive models. Contrary to our initial approach, where draws were excluded, we sought to understand the impact of including these outcomes on the performance of our models. We conducted experiments using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XG Boosting, evaluating their performance with a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (using the ’macro’ approach).</p>

<div id="A1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For this experiment, we retained draws in our dataset, acknowledging their significance in the soccer landscape.
