<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The newly emerging federated learning (FL) framework offers a new way to train machine learning models in a privacy-preserving manner. However, traditional FL algorithms are based on an event-triggered aggregation, which suffers from stragglers and communication overhead issues. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a time-triggered FL algorithm (TT-Fed) over wireless networks, which is a generalized form of classic synchronous and asynchronous FL. Taking the constrained resource and unreliable nature of wireless communication into account, we jointly study the user selection and bandwidth optimization problem to minimize the FL training loss. To solve this joint optimization problem, we provide a thorough convergence analysis for TT-Fed. Based on the obtained analytical convergence upper bound, the optimization problem is decomposed into tractable sub-problems with respect to each global aggregation round, and finally solved by our proposed online search algorithm. Simulation results show that compared to asynchronous FL (FedAsync) and FL with asynchronous user tiers (FedAT) benchmarks, our proposed TT-Fed algorithm improves the converged test accuracy by up to 12.5% and 5%, respectively, under highly imbalanced and non-IID data, while substantially reducing the communication overhead.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the past decades, portable smart devices with in-built high-definition sensors have gained access to an increasing amount of customized user data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Trained via such massive data, machine learning-based applications provide a revolutionary way to distill information from these data resources and will continue thriving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, the training procedure often involves frequent data sharing to a data center or cloud, leading to a growing concern about the leakage of privacy-sensitive user data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The newly emerging federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is a promising solution for both privacy issues and resource-constrained data transmission problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In FL, the learning task is solved in an iterative way by leveraging the local computation capabilities at users to train a shared model coordinated by the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">server</em>, without sharing any user data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The detailed steps of FL are: 1) at the beginning of each iteration, the server distributes the current global model to the selected users; 2) the selected users perform local updates using their local data sets in parallel based on the received global model and then upload local models to the server; 3) the server aggregates these local models to generate a new global model, and the iteration goes on until convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Based on how the aggregation is triggered, FL can be classified into two categories: 1) Synchronous (Sync) FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where the global aggregation at the server is triggered until <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">all updates from the selected users are received</em><span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Aggregation deadline may apply to avoid useless waiting for offline users.</span></span></span>;
2) Asynchronous (Async) FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, where the global aggregation at the server is triggered whenever <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">an update from any selected user is received</em>.

</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Owing to the high communication efficiency gained in synchronized training settings, Sync FL algorithms are widely studied in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and the main challenges of its wireless implementation lie in the resource-constrained and unreliable nature of wireless networks. Due to limited communication resource budgets, the user selection problem was studied to maximize the resource utilization with the focus on energy efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, training accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, training time<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and etc. However, these works all assume that the uploaded models are successfully decoded at the server, and ignore the potential negative impact brought by the unreliable nature of wireless networks. Taking the practical transmission failure/error into consideration, the joint resource allocation and user selection problems were studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its benefits in high communication efficiency, Sync FL can result in low training efficiency, since its convergence speed is limited by the slowest users, known as stragglers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. To handle the straggler issue, Async FL is a more flexible solution by allowing Async aggregation without waiting for the stragglers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. However, Async FL has its own unique challenges, including: 1) the staleness problem, where the local model based on an old global model may be harmful to the current aggregation. This problem may be solved by applying a mixing function to exclude the users with “toxic” local updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; 2) the computation bias, where faster users contribute more to the global model and lead to bias. This bias issue can be solved by introducing weight factors to control the influence of different users during the global aggregation step <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>; and 3) the high communication overhead, where the frequent information exchange between the user and the server can easily induce a communication bottleneck and result in low communication efficiency. The wireless implementation of Async FL is still in its infancy, and the above works did not consider the wireless settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the training efficiency drawback in Sync FL and the communication efficiency drawback in Async FL, grouping users into small tiers (or clusters) and aggregating their models with respect to each tier is a promising solution. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a tier-based Sync FL, where users with similar computation delay are grouped and selected for aggregation to solve the straggler issue. Extending from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, a multi-tier FL was first proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, namely FedAT, based on intra-tier aggregation in a Sync way and the inter-tier aggregation in an Async way. While promising, the above studies could result in unstable and degraded performance under highly non-IID user data, and they overlook the impact of wireless communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Notably, the aforementioned FL algorithms are all based on an event-triggered aggregation behavior, where the global aggregation occurs only if a specific event happens. This will lead to fluctuated global aggregation round durations, which not only causes stragglers in Sync FL, but also leads to unstable training results and high communication overhead in Async FL. Specifically, in Sync FL, since all updates from the selected users should be received before aggregation, the time duration of a global aggregation round is prolonged by waiting for stragglers, which results in low training efficiency. On the other extreme, in Async FL, since the global aggregation is triggered whenever a local update is received, those local models arrive at the server over different but similar time instances will trigger the global aggregation several times in a short duration, namely, <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">aggregation glitch</em> (An example is shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-B Time-triggered Federated Learning (TT-Fed) ‣ II System Model ‣ Time-triggered Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, marked by the orange circle.). This is not desirable especially in highly non-IID data scenarios, as more local models would be required to merge into the global model to accelerate the training and to generate a more robust model. The hybrid multi-tier FedAT can alleviate the aggregation glitch to some degree, but still, it can not be solved fundamentally (As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-B Time-triggered Federated Learning (TT-Fed) ‣ II System Model ‣ Time-triggered Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the aggregation glitch still exists in FedAT). Moreover, due to the Async inter-tier aggregation of FedAT, broadcasting can not be leveraged to distribute global model for users in different tiers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the above issues, one promising solution is to conduct global aggregation at a fixed time interval. This allows local models from users who managed to complete their local updating within the same interval to be aggregated together. By doing so, users are naturally partitioned into different tiers, and it is possible for the global model to be broadcast to users in different tiers for communication overhead reduction, as they are aligned at the beginning of their local updating round. We coin this solution as multi-tier time-triggered FL, which reaps the benefits of both Sync and Async FL. To our best knowledge, <em id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">this is the first work that proposes a multi-tier time-triggered FL framework for wireless networks</em>.

To control the computation bias, we also consider weighting factors for different tiers and design a novel global aggregation scheme.</p>

Meanwhile, as users with similar computation capabilities are grouped into smaller tiers, the straggler issues in Sync FL can be alleviated to a great extent.

Moreover, the learning curves of FedAsync and FedAT fluctuate. This is because the data class distribution at each user becomes more and more skewed, which means some data classes are too scarce or even missing. To have a smooth and robust learning curve, we need more information from more users for a single global aggregation step. As aggregation in FedAsync and FedAT involves fewer users and due to the existence of aggregation glitch in the event-triggered setting, updates from faster users/tiers tend to drift from the global optimum making the models not robust to skewed data. Without an efficient way to control the computation bias, the test accuracy of FedAsync is largely degraded under the highly skewed data setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Interestingly, even when the data class distribution becomes skewed, TT-Fed can still maintain fast convergence with robust performance, and achieve the highest accuracy. This is because the cross-tier synchronization and user grouping in TT-Fed can help gain more diverse information in a single global aggregation round and help yield a smoother learning curve compared to the event-triggered FedAT. Meanwhile, grouping users into smaller tiers can efficiently solve the straggler problem in Sync FL, yielding faster convergence.

For fair comparison, each tier in FedAT contains the same users as that in TT-Fed. From Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-A Impact of data distribution ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Time-triggered Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we see that FedAsync requires larger number of communication rounds to reach a given target accuracy compared to its Sync counterpart (FedAvg). This is because in FedAsync the server has to frequently transmit the global model to whichever users ready for the next local updating round, whereas, in FedAvg users are synchronized at each global aggregation round, and model broadcasting can boost communication efficiency. Moreover, FedAsync suffers from severe computation bias which increases the number of communication rounds required to go from a lower target accuracy (i.e., 70%) to a higher one (i.e., 80%). Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-A Impact of data distribution ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Time-triggered Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> also shows that with the same tier partitioning, TT-Fed achieves improved communication efficiency compared to the event-triggered FedAT algorithm. This is because users in different tiers are aligned in TT-Fed to receive the global model via broadcasting, while in FedAT users in different tiers obtain the global model asynchronously.</p>

In this case, the computation delay is similar for each user but data class distribution is highly skewed. Therefore, to ensure a good estimation of the global gradient, we need more users in a tier to guarantee that the data diversity is similar enough to the global data distribution. This explains why partitioning users into more tiers will suffer more from the skewed data class distribution.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a multi-tier time-triggered FL algorithm (TT-Fed) for resource-limited and unreliable wireless networks. We formulated a joint user selection and bandwidth allocation problem with the aim of training loss minimization. To decompose this problem into tractable sub-problems, we provided a detailed convergence analysis and derived an analytical convergence upper bound for our proposed TT-Fed algorithm. Moreover, a sufficient condition was given to guarantee the convergence of TT-Fed. Finally, we proposed an online search algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Our simulation results showed that the proposed TT-Fed algorithm can achieve fast convergence with robust performance under highly non-IID data, while substantially reducing the communication overhead.</p>
