<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The emerging industrial metaverses realize the mapping and expanding operations of physical industry into virtual space for significantly upgrading intelligent manufacturing. The industrial metaverses obtain data from various production and operation lines by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and thus conduct effective data analysis and decision-making, thereby enhancing the production efficiency of the physical space, reducing operating costs, and maximizing commercial value. However, there still exist bottlenecks when integrating metaverses into IIoT, such as the privacy leakage of sensitive data with commercial secrets, IIoT sensing data freshness, and incentives for sharing these data. In this paper, we design a user-defined privacy-preserving framework with decentralized federated learning for the industrial metaverses. To further improve privacy protection of industrial metaverse, a cross-chain empowered federated learning framework is further utilized to perform decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving data training on both physical and virtual spaces through a hierarchical blockchain architecture with a main chain and multiple subchains. Moreover, we introduce the age of information as the data freshness metric and thus design an age-based contract model to motivate data sensing among IIoT nodes. Numerical results indicate the efficiency of the proposed framework and incentive mechanism in the industrial metaverses.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As the current wave of the industrial revolution, the digital transformation of manufacturing industry has taken place.
Different from the traditional industrial digitization to improve the physical space through digital operations, industrial metaverse creates a virtual space by transforming the physical space based on the real interaction and persistence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
One of the most potential applications of industrial metaverse is 3D simulation, modeling, and architectural design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For instance, an open platform called Omniverse has been built by NVIDIA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Multi-user real-time 3D simulation and visualization of physical entities and properties are supported in a shared virtual space for industrial applications, such as automotive design.
To build an industrial metaverse, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) play an essential and foundational role in networking and communication.
The IIoT nodes collect a large amount of sensing data to bridge the virtual space and physical space, thus providing users with a completely real, lasting, and smooth interactive experience in the industrial metaverses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
While the industrial metaverse requires powerful hardware equipments, rich network resources and advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies as the base.
By collaboratively applying cutting-edge technologies, such as Federated Learning (FL), blockchain and digital twins, the industrial metaverse for IIoT can significantly modernize digital operations in the current digital revolution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although industrial metaverse brings amazing changes to industrial areas, this technology is still in its infancy. There exist challenging bottlenecks for wide deployment and future popularization:
1) The industrial metaverse is prone to leaking IIoT nodes’ privacy. Since the industrial metaverse will collect more data from IIoT nodes than ever before, the consequences will be worse than ever if IIoT nodes’ data is not effectively protected <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Thereby, due to privacy concerns, IIoT nodes may be unwilling to share data with private information in industrial metaverses, which hinders the comprehensive data analysis using machine learning technologies for intelligence improvement of the industrial metaverse.
2) To ensure immersive services in the industrial metaverse, fresh sensing data is significantly important to enhance the service quality of time-sensitive services.
Since the IIoT nodes are energy-constrained, they can not respond to each data request of learning-based metaverse services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. As a result, the IIoT nodes may not provide fresh data or join metaverse services without a reasonable incentive mechanism. It is still challenging how to incentivize IIoT nodes with fresh data in industrial metaverse services.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenges, in this paper, we first apply federated learning and cross-chain technologies to design a user-defined privacy-preserving framework for sensing data analysis in industrial metaverses. To improve service quality of industrial metaverse, Age of Information (AoI) is introduced as the data-freshness metric of sensing data for industrial metaverse services. We then design an age-based contract model to incentivize data sensing among IIoT nodes. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p>

Multiple IIoT nodes in the physical space are managed by a subchain <math id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">P</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">P</annotation></semantics></math> during training. However, due to the privacy concerns, these physical workers may be not willing to upload all privacy-sensitive data to the industrial metaverse directly.</p>

Since the physical nodes are reluctant to upload all data with privacy-sensitive information to the virtual space in the industrial metaverse. The datasets of virtual nodes are incomplete. If a learning task is only trained by the virtual nodes, the accuracy of the learning model will be decreased and the generalization ability will be poor. To this end, a user-defined privacy-preserving training framework is designed with FL for industrial metaverses, in which IIoT nodes can customize to upload non-sensitive sensing data to the virtual space for learning-based metaverse tasks or applications, and keep the sensitive sensing data locally in the physical space for strong privacy protection. The FL technology breaks data islands between the virtual space and physical space, and enables collaborative learning among the virtual and physical nodes.</p>

Under the information asymmetry, the service provider uses contract theory to find out the best workers.
Here, the service provider is the leader for designing contracts, and each worker selects the best contract item according to its type.

We can observe that, the utilities of workers are increasing with the increasing types of the workers. As expected, each worker selects the contract item corresponding to its own type that exactly maximizes its own utility. For example, the type-4 workers obtain the optimal utility only when they choose the type-4 contract. The utilities of the workers with higher types are larger than those with lower types.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied data privacy protection issues and incentive mechanism design for the industrial metaverse. We proposed a privacy-preserving framework for data training by federated learning on both virtual space and physical space of the industrial metaverse. Cross-chain technology is utilized to design a decentralized FL architecture with a main chain and multiple subchains for secure model training. Furthermore, to improve service quality of time-sensitive learning tasks, we introduce age of information as the metric of data freshness and design an AoI based contract theory model for incentivizing IIoT nodes contributing fresh sensing data. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed framework and incentive mechanism for the industrial metaverses.</p>
