<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In cross-silo federated learning (FL), companies collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing heterogeneous data. Prior related work focused on algorithm development to tackle data heterogeneity. However, the dual problem of <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">coopetition</span>, i.e., FL collaboration and market competition, remains under-explored. This paper studies the FL coopetition using a dynamic two-period game model. In period 1, an incumbent company trains a local model and provides model-based services at a chosen price to users. In period 2, an entrant company enters, and both companies decide whether to engage in FL collaboration and then compete in selling model-based services at different prices to users. Analyzing the two-period game is challenging due to data heterogeneity, and that the incumbent’s period one pricing has a temporal impact on coopetition in period 2, resulting in a non-concave problem. To address this issue, we decompose the problem into several concave sub-problems and develop an algorithm that achieves a global optimum. Numerical results on three public datasets show two interesting insights. First, FL training brings model performance gain as well as competition loss, and collaboration occurs only when the performance gain outweighs the loss. Second, data heterogeneity can incentivize the incumbent to limit market penetration in period 1 and promote price competition in period 2.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm where multiple companies or organizations train a shared model collaboratively without directly exchanging local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Typically, the process involves each participant training a local model on their dataset and then sharing model updates with a coordinating server that aggregates these updates to improve a global model. This local training and aggregation iteration continues until the global model converges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Potential application scenarios for cross-silo FL are abundant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. For example, in healthcare, hospitals can collaborate on medical research (e.g., disease diagnosis) without sharing sensitive patient data. In finance, different banks can use FL for improved fraud detection without exposing customer data. In smart manufacturing, companies can enhance predictive maintenance without revealing proprietary operational data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While a significant volume of recent research has focused on improving the model performance in cross-silo FL (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>), the critical aspect of <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">market competition</span> remains less explored. In practice, companies can utilize the shared global model developed through FL to offer model-based services, hence competing for the same pool of potential users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. This competition can manifest across various industries. In healthcare, hospitals may compete to attract patients by offering diagnostic services or personalized treatment plans. In finance, banks might leverage an enhanced fraud detection system to attract customers by offering greater security and reduced risk of fraud. In smart manufacturing, companies could use the shared global model to optimize operations and attract clients/partnerships via more efficient production services. The dual focus of FL collaboration and market competition is termed as <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FL coopetition</span>, which is the focus of this paper.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While a few recent studies looked at FL coopetition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, they focused on static competition and overlooked the important aspect of dynamic market entry.
Market entrant usually serves as a catalyst for technology innovation (e.g., model and algorithm development in cross-silo FL) and helps provide insights into the interactions between incumbents and entrants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This also impacts the socioeconomic landscape by promoting coopetition and increasing the quality of services (via FL) available to users in the market.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study FL coopetition using a dynamic market entry model that spans two time periods involving three entities: users, an incumbent company, and an entrant company (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Technical Report: Coopetition in Heterogeneous Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>):</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Period 1: Only an incumbent company exists in the market, providing users with the model-based service. For example, consider a healthcare provider that has developed a new AI-based tool for early diagnosis of a specific disease and is the only service provider in the market. The company trains a local model on its dataset and offers services to patients at a chosen price.</p>

The incumbent and the entrant need to decide strategically on whether to engage in FL collaboration. If they collaborate, they will use a jointly developed global model to enhance and offer their diagnostic services. If they opt against collaboration, each will continue using individually trained models. In addition, since users can now choose between different service providers, there is a price competition between the incumbent and the entrant.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To answer Question <a href="#Thmquestion1" title="Question 1. ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Technical Report: Coopetition in Heterogeneous Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we model the FL collaboration and market competition as two (intertwined) games between the incumbent and the entrant. Each company aims to maximize its profit (from selling model-based services to users). We are interested in solving the game-theoretical equilibrium, which is highly non-trivial due to two reasons. First, companies in practice are heterogeneous regarding their data distributions and quantities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Second, users may exhibit heterogeneous preferences towards companies’ services (even if the services have similar qualities). This can happen when some users find that a particular company’s service matches more closely with their individual characteristics, e.g., demographic profiles and personal attributes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. It is challenging to analyze (or even model) the game. To address this issue, we resort to the renowned Hotelling model in economics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and generalize it to model various types of heterogeneity. We characterized the equilibrium with arbitrary data distributions/quantities of companies and under minor assumptions about users’ preferences.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Among aforementioned heterogeneity types, data heterogeneity receives the most research attention from the FL community and continues to be the major bottleneck <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. There are many excellent studies on algorithm development to mitigate the client drift issue caused by data heterogeneity, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.

Notice that the decision-making of the incumbent’s pricing in period 1 presents challenges due to its temporal impacts. That is, it not only influences user decisions in period 1, but also affects the decisions of both companies regarding FL collaboration (with heterogeneous data) and price competition, as well as user decisions in period 2. We will show that this interdependence makes the equilibrium analysis a challenging non-concave problem.</p>

Many studies have focused on algorithm development to tackle client drift. One commonly used technique is regularization by adding proximal terms to restrain local updates with respect to the global model, e.g., FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, FedUV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Other works have approached the problem using personalization (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>) and local learning generality (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>).</p>

Our work is related to game theoretical and, in particular, incentive studies for cross-silo FL, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. For example, Tang and Wong <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposed an auction-like mechanism to encourage organizations’ FL training participation. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> studied how organizations participate in long-term collaboration.

Wu and Yu <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> focused on a fully competitive market.
Tan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> developed an algorithm to find stable collaboration structures among companies. Tsoy and Konstantinov <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> studied both the price and quantity competitions in cross-silo FL. However, these studies did not study how data heterogeneity affects competition. More importantly, they looked at a static competition model while we study a dynamic model where the the incumbent and entrant have temporal interactions. The dynamic model renders the problem a challenging non-concave one.</p>

Market competition is an extensively studied topic in economics, e.g., see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> for comprehensive discussions on theories of competition.

Our model and analysis differ from the conventional Hotelling due to the unique features of data heterogeneity and collaborative training in FL. That is, prior studies considered that each company can independently decide their service qualities to attract users. In cross-silo FL, however, the qualities of companies’ model-based services are dependent on their heterogeneous data distributions and the FL collaboration strategies. This makes our analysis more challenging than and conclusions different from prior literature.</p>

We observe that while FL enhances model performance across the three datasets (see Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.3 Company 𝐼’s Pricing in Period 1 ‣ 3 Solving the Two-Period Game ‣ Technical Report: Coopetition in Heterogeneous Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), intriguingly, collaboration is observed only on CIFAR datasets but not on HAM10000. This may seem counter-intuitive at first glance because the improved performance through FL suggests a natural incentive to collaborative behavior. However, it is crucial to note that improved performance alone does not necessitate collaboration in a competitive environment. Recall from Corollary <a href="#ThmCor1" title="Corollary 1. ‣ 3.2.1 Companies’ Pricing in Period 2 ‣ 3.2 Companies’ Decisions in Period 2 ‣ 3 Solving the Two-Period Game ‣ Technical Report: Coopetition in Heterogeneous Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> that a company’s price increases in its own model performance but at the same time decreases in its competitor’s model performance. Hence, collaboration is a beneficial strategy only when the performance gains are substantial enough to outweigh the loss from price competition. For instance, CIFAR datasets exhibit significant performance enhancements (e.g., <math id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta=0.1" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">β</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">0.1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2">𝛽</ci><cn type="float" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.3">0.1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.3.m3.1c">\beta=0.1</annotation></semantics></math> on CIFAR-10 in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.3 Company 𝐼’s Pricing in Period 1 ‣ 3 Solving the Two-Period Game ‣ Technical Report: Coopetition in Heterogeneous Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), which motivates collaboration, while the less significant improvements in HAM10000 (e.g., <math id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="D_{E}=3k" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml">D</mi><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml">E</mi></msub><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.2.cmml">3</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.3.cmml">k</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.2">𝐷</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.3">𝐸</ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3"><times id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.2">3</cn><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.3">𝑘</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.4.m4.1c">D_{E}=3k</annotation></semantics></math> in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 3.3 Company 𝐼’s Pricing in Period 1 ‣ 3 Solving the Two-Period Game ‣ Technical Report: Coopetition in Heterogeneous Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) are insufficient to motivate the same collaborative effort.

This can model real-world market conditions where multiple companies often coexist and new entrants periodically disrupt existing equilibriums. In this case, we can similarly analyze the user behavior by comparing the payoffs obtained when purchasing from different companies. For companies’ FL collaboration, we can use the coalitional game theory to find stable FL collaboration structures, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work studied the under-explored problem of FL coopetition (FL collaboration and market competition) using a dynamic two-period model. One challenge pertains to multi-dimensional heterogeneity in terms of companies’ data distributions and quantities, as well as users’ service preferences. Another challenges is associated with solving a non-concave optimization problem. We decomposed the problem into multiple concave sub-problems and managed to characterize the solutions to the two-period game. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on three datasets have lead to two implications. First, FL brings both model performance gain and competition loss, and collaboration occurs only when the performance gain outweighs the loss. Second, data heterogeneity can incentivize the incumbent to limit market penetration in period 1 and promote price competition in period 2.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For future work, it is interesting to study how data quality (e.g., label correctness and label sparsity) affects FL coopetition and further develop robust algorithms to enhance performance. It is also interesting to incorporate privacy enhancing techniques, which can be of particular interest to companies, into the coopetition analysis.</p>
