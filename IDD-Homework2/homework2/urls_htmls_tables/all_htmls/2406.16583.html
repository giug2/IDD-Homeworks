<p id="id9.2" class="ltx_p">Federated learning enables distributed clients to collaborate on training while storing their data locally to protect client privacy. However, due to the heterogeneity of data, models, and devices, the final global model may need to perform better for tasks on each client. Communication bottlenecks, data heterogeneity, and model heterogeneity have been common challenges in federated learning.
In this work, we considered a label distribution skew problem, a type of data heterogeneity easily overlooked. In the context of classification, we propose a personalized federated learning approach called pFedPM. In our process, we replace traditional gradient uploading with feature uploading, which helps reduce communication costs and allows for heterogeneous client models. These feature representations play a role in preserving privacy to some extent.
We use a hyperparameter <math id="id8.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="a" display="inline"><semantics id="id8.1.m1.1a"><mi id="id8.1.m1.1.1" xref="id8.1.m1.1.1.cmml">a</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id8.1.m1.1b"><ci id="id8.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id8.1.m1.1.1">𝑎</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id8.1.m1.1c">a</annotation></semantics></math> to mix local and global features, which enables us to control the degree of personalization. We also introduced a relation network as an additional decision layer, which provides a non-linear learnable classifier to predict labels. Experimental results show that, with an appropriate setting of <math id="id9.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="a" display="inline"><semantics id="id9.2.m2.1a"><mi id="id9.2.m2.1.1" xref="id9.2.m2.1.1.cmml">a</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id9.2.m2.1b"><ci id="id9.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id9.2.m2.1.1">𝑎</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id9.2.m2.1c">a</annotation></semantics></math>, our scheme outperforms several recent FL methods on MNIST, FEMNIST, and CRIFAR10 datasets and achieves fewer communications.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid advances in deep learning have benefited dramatically from large datasets like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, in the real world, data may be distributed on numerous mobile devices and the Internet of Things(IoT), requiring decentralized training of deep networks.
Driven by such realistic needs, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has become an emerging research topic. Federated learning (FL) enables distributed clients to train a generic global model collaboratively on a centralized server while keeping data locally to preserve clients’ privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Due to the advantages of privacy-preserving and training across clients, FL has been widely used and studied in industry and academia. But it still needs to be fully exploited and faces many challenges, such as data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, and communication bottleneck.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The most notorious challenge in federated learning is data heterogeneity. Due to differences in regions and behaviors, clients’ local data exhibit significant heterogeneity. The current mainstream approach to addressing this challenge is personalized federated learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Filip Hanzely et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> have proposed a method that generates customized models for each client by mixing local and global models to balance the two. Another commonly used personalized federated learning method is model decoupling, which separates the model into representation layers and decision layers, with the representation layers extracting features from the data and the decision layers making classification predictions based on these features. However, these personalized methods mainly rely on gradient aggregation, which leads to higher communication costs and also limits model heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Mi Luo et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> found that in data-heterogeneous scenarios, the deeper layers of the model exhibit higher heterogeneity in CKA (centered kernel alignment) feature similarity across different clients. The classifier layer has a more significant bias than other layers, and the classifier weight norms tend to favor classes with more training samples. However, the method aims to train a global model to address data heterogeneity. In practice, a single global model only works for some clients. We are inspired by the observation above: under data heterogeneity, significant differences exist in the final layer outputs of the representation layers among different clients. However, these differences benefit personalized federated learning as they reflect locally specific data distributions. We can leverage these feature differences to improve the performance of local models better. Our particular steps are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.2" class="ltx_p">First, we consider a heterogeneous scenario with skewed label distribution<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which consists of an imbalance in the number of labels and a class-missing method. This paper proposes a new personalized FL scheme(pfedPM) based on feature fusion. In our scheme, we decouple the local client model into two parts: the feature extraction module and the decision module. As shown in Fig<a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-D Model Heterogeneity in Federated Learning ‣ II related work ‣ Personalized federated learning based on feature fusion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, We designed a two-layer model structure with a shared feature extraction module. We used a conventional neural network as the decision module in the first layer.
In contrast, we employed a relation module from few-shot learning as the decision module in the second layer. Here, the local clients replace the traditional gradient updates by uploading their local data feature representations. These local data features refer to the average output of the feature extraction module for the data with the same label. For each category label, there is a corresponding local feature. This approach allows the client models to be heterogeneous, as we only need to ensure that the dimensions of the feature information are the same. At the same time, the communication cost required for federated learning is positively correlated with the number of categories and the dimensions of the feature information from local clients. Assuming the size of gradients uploaded by the model is 20,000, and the size of feature information is 50, with an average of 10 classes per client. Compared to gradient uploading, the dimensions of our method’s upload are 10 * 50, much smaller than the traditional one. This is effective in alleviating communication bottlenecks. For the locally uploaded feature information sent to the server, the server performs average aggregation on features with the same label to obtain the global feature information for that label, which is then sent back to the clients. We use a hyperparameter <math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="a" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">a</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝑎</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">a</annotation></semantics></math> to mix local and global features to find the optimal balance. In the local model updates, we introduced a regularization term to ensure that the local feature information stays consistent with the mixed features information. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.
The results show that at appropriate values of <math id="S1.p4.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="a" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p4.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml">a</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.2.m2.1.1">𝑎</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.2.m2.1c">a</annotation></semantics></math>, our method outperforms several recent FL methods and achieves less communication on the MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, many studies have focused on analyzing imbalanced data. Real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distributions, which seriously affects the effectiveness of machine learning. Resampling<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and reweighting<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> are traditional methods for dealing with imbalanced data. Recent work uses reweighting methods to make
the network pay more attention to minority categories by assigning
variable weights to each class. New perspectives, such as decoupled training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and delayed rescaling schemes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, have also been proven effective. Most previous work
on imbalanced data has focused on long-tail distributions. However, in the setting of federated learning, data may
be imbalanced in many ways, such as quantity-based
label imbalance and distribution-based label imbalance. Label distribution bias is always present in practical applications.
For example, pandas are only found in China and zoos, and a person’s face may only appear in a few places worldwide. Additionally, label
distribution skew includes long-tail scenarios, but long-tail methods cannot handle the issue of missing classes, which is common in federated learning.
One research strategy to address the statistical heterogeneity of data distribution is to train
multiple global models through clustering and train different global models for
different client groups<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Another approach is to clone the global model, adaptively update high-performing subsets of the global model, and discard poorly performing models to generate specialized models for each client<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.

Another common strategy is decoupling the local model into a representation and decision layers. The representation layer extracts features from the data, while the decision layer classifies the extracted features for prediction.
FedPer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> learns the body and head during the local training phase and shares only the body with the server. Therefore, the local, personalized model comprises a shared body part and a personalized head. On the other hand, FedRep <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> divides its local updates into two steps. Specifically, each client learns its personalized head by receiving a fixed body from the server, and then it updates the body with the latest personalized head.
FedBABU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> only learns the body with random initialization and a fixed head during the local update phase and shares only the body with the server. After the training, the global model is fine-tuned to obtain personalized models.
FedROD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> designs a dual-head single-body architecture consisting of a general head trained with class-balanced loss and a personalized head trained with experience loss. The body and available head are shared with the server for aggregation, while the personalized head remains private. FedNH <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> combines class prototype consistency and semantics to learn high-quality representations for classification and imposes constraints on the head to prevent prototype collapse due to class imbalance issues.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The issue of communication overhead has been one of the significant challenges in federated learning. In practical scenarios, especially when the required global model size is large, network bandwidth constraints and the number of working nodes can exacerbate communication bottlenecks in federated learning, leading to client devices dropping out and other issues. The most straightforward approach to address the communication overhead issue is to train only low-capacity models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. These models occupy less space throughout the federated learning framework, but the trade-off is reduced model accuracy. Using additional computation to reduce the number of communication rounds needed for training has limitations in terms of the number of local time elements performed during local training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and it needs to address the problem of model divergence. Model compression strategies<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> may lead to a loss in long-term accuracy and may not be sufficient to address the reduction of communication time<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> solely.
Moreover, it needs to be determined how these compression strategies handle the statistical challenges associated with highly personalized and heterogeneous data distribution. Nader Bouacida <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed an Adaptive Federated Dropout (AFD) algorithm and combined it with existing compression methods to reduce communication costs, resulting in a 57X reduction in convergence time. However, trimming the global model to reduce communication can lead to a loss of accuracy. Model decoupling methods in personalized federated learning can also facilitate communication to some extent, as they only upload the model parameters of the body part.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In practical application scenarios, model heterogeneity is common, as clients often have different hardware and computing capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Knowledge Distillation (KD) based Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> has been proposed to address this challenge by transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student model with a different model architecture. However, these methods require an additional common dataset to calibrate the outputs of both the student and teacher models, which increases computational costs. Additionally, the performance of the model is also affected by the distribution differences between the common dataset and the client datasets. Some research has attempted to integrate neural architecture search with Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which enables the discovery of custom model architectures for each group of clients with different hardware capabilities and configurations.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our approach involves exchanging feature information of labels between the server and client machines instead of model parameters, which is beneficial for privacy protection. First, the low-dimensional representation of labels from the same category is averaged to generate feature information as a one-dimensional vector, and this process is irreversible. Secondly, even with reconstructing uploaded gradients for the original data through gradient attacks, it’s impossible to reconstruct the actual client data from the feature information. This effectively safeguards the privacy of the clients.</p>

For the MNIST and FEMNIST datasets, our base model consists of two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. Specifically, the two convolutional layers serve as our shared feature extraction module, while the two fully connected layers act as the first prediction module. Additionally, we employed one convolutional layer and two fully connected layers as the relationship module. As for the CIFAR10 dataset, we adopted the ResNet18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> model.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Each client learns a supervised learning task. We use ”n” to control the number of classes and ”k” to control the number of training instances per class. We randomly vary the ”n” and ”k” values among clients to simulate heterogeneous scenarios with skewed label distributions. We define the average values of ”n” and ”k” and then add random noise to each user’s ”n” and ”k”. The purpose of introducing variance in ”n” is to control the heterogeneity in the class space, while the purpose of introducing conflict in ”k” is to control the data size imbalance.
We set up 20 clients on the MNIST, FEMNIST, and CRIFAR10 datasets, and each client has an average data size of 100 for each class. The batch size is 10, and the number of local update rounds is 1. The local clients are trained with the SGD optimizer, with a learning rate 0.01 and momentum of 0.5. Our initial hyperparameter set is directly from the default hyperparameter set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. We assume that all clients perform learning tasks with heterogeneous statistical distributions. To simulate different degrees of heterogeneity, we fix the standard deviation to be 1 or 2.

The experimental results indicate that the feature fusion method outperforms the model fusion method in terms of accuracy compared to L2GD, requiring lower communication costs. This suggests combining local and global features through feature fusion can improve the model’s performance and reduce the data transmission overhead between clients and the server in federated learning. Therefore, feature fusion is a more practical approach to address the heterogeneity problem in federated learning.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel feature fusion federated learning (FL) approach to address challenging FL scenarios with heterogeneous input/output spaces, data distributions, and model architectures. The method achieves personalized federated learning by exchanging and blending local and global features. Additionally, we employ a relationship module to identify decision boundaries between different classes, resulting in slight improvements in the experimental results. Based on the empirical findings, our approach outperforms several recent FL methods on the MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets.
