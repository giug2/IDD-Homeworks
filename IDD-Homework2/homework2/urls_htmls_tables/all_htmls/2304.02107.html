<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The idea to generate synthetic data as a tool for broadening access to sensitive microdata has been proposed for the first time three decades ago. While first applications of the idea emerged around the turn of the century, the approach really gained momentum over the last ten years, stimulated at least in parts by some recent developments in computer science.
We consider the upcoming 30th jubilee of Rubin’s seminal paper on synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rubin, <a href="#bib.bib169" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite> as an opportunity to look back at the historical developments, but also to offer a review of the
diverse approaches and methodological underpinnings proposed over the years. We will also discuss the various strategies that have been suggested to measure the utility and remaining risk of disclosure of the generated data.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We live in a data-driven world today. Data are collected whenever we interact with our environment, whenever we use our loyalty card in the supermarket, measure our physical activities through wearables, when we check the online weather forecast for our weekend trip, or when we stay in contact with our friends using social media. In the public sector, the ever-growing importance of data is reflected in concepts such as evidence-based policy, and open data movements (see, for example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Publications Office of the European Union (<a href="#bib.bib144" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> or <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">U.S. General Services Administration (<a href="#bib.bib186" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>), and the fact that increasingly more countries explicitly define their own data strategies (see, for example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">European
Commission (<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> or <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> for the UK). In industry, the increased reliance on machine learning methods for decision-making results in ever-growing demands for more data to train these models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the increased availability and storage of data also raises concerns regarding confidentiality and privacy. There is an increasing tension between the societal benefits of our digitized world and broad data access on one hand and the potential harms resulting from misuse of data that have not been sufficiently protected on the other hand. Data providers have been concerned about these risks for decades, and various strategies have been developed over the years to avoid disclosing sensitive information when disseminating data to the public <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Domingo-Ferrer et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Duncan et al., <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. Still, several prominent examples of confidentiality breaches both in the public and in the private sector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Homer
et al., <a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>; Ohm, <a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>; Sweeney, <a href="#bib.bib180" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; De Montjoye et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> have demonstrated that risks of disclosure often still tend to be underestimated. Increasing computer power and the fact that more and more data are publicly available or are sold by private companies also imply that traditional protection strategies such as swapping, top-coding, or suppression are no longer sufficient to adequately protect the data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A promising alternative to address the trade-off between broad data access and disclosure protection is the release of synthetic data. With this approach, a model is fitted to the original data and draws from this model are used to replace the original values. Depending on the desired level of protection, only some records (partial synthesis) or the entire dataset (full synthesis) are replaced by synthetic values.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The idea of using synthetic data as a disclosure avoidance strategy is commonly attributed to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rubin (<a href="#bib.bib169" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Little (<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite> (although related ideas have been proposed earlier by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liew
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">1985</a>)</cite>). Their approach to synthetic data was motivated by their own work on multiple imputation (MI) for nonresponse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rubin, <a href="#bib.bib167" title="" class="ltx_ref">1978</a>; Little and
Rubin, <a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite>. Instead of imputing missing values, they suggested adopting the approach to replace sensitive values with <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_inline-quote ltx_outerquote">“imputed”</span> values. Similar to the nonresponse context, the release of multiple synthetic datasets would then allow to obtain valid variance estimates that also account for the uncertainty from the synthesis models (assuming the models are correctly specified). However, it took another ten years before the methodology was fully developed, and the first practical applications started to emerge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Independent of the developments in the statistical community, the computer science community also proposed relying on synthetic data as a way of mitigating the risks of disclosure. The large body of work developed in this field has only rarely aimed at ensuring valid statistical inference, including properly quantifying the uncertainty in the estimates obtained from the synthetic data. The research on synthetic data in computer science was (and still is) predominantly motivated by providing easier data access to train machine learning models. Still, both approaches to synthetic data share the same core goal: ideally, any analysis run on the synthetic data should provide approximately the same answers that would have been obtained if the analysis were run on the original data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">While the body of research has grown steadily over the last thirty years and first deployments of the idea date back to the turn of the century, the concept really gained momentum in the last five to ten years. Many statistical agencies, but also other government agencies such as tax authorities, ministries, or central banks, are exploring synthetic data approaches as a promising tool to broaden public access to their data. Especially within the health sector, the approach gained popularity with applications ranging from generating synthetic patient data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Choi et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> over synthetic electronic health records <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yahi
et al., <a href="#bib.bib198" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> to generating synthetic cell images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Siwicki, <a href="#bib.bib174" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. More and more start-ups are offering synthetic data generation as a service and in the industry, synthetic data are used in such diverse contexts as autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Osinski et al., <a href="#bib.bib138" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, classifying computed tomography images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Frid-Adar et al., <a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> or environmental monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Allken et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Given this growing interest in the field, we consider the 30th jubilee of synthetic data as an opportunity to look back at the historical developments, but also to offer a review of the diverse approaches and methodological underpinnings proposed over the years. We need to emphasize at this point that the diversity of the field and the exponential growth in literature in recent years makes it impossible to offer a detailed review of all methodological tweaks and use cases. We will therefore limit our review to synthetic data methods and applications that specifically aim at offering confidentiality protection. Other contexts in which ideas based on synthetic data have been exploited include, for example, micro simulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(O’Donoghue, <a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, which generates synthetic populations from various data sources, or applications in machine learning, where synthetic data are generated to increase the data pool for model training. Furthermore, we will only discuss and review strategies for synthesis of regular datasets, that is, data structures in which the units are organized in rows and the columns contain the information collected about these units. We will not cover synthesis strategies for text data or images.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section <a href="#S2" title="2 A brief history of synthetic data ‣ 30 years of synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we will provide a brief history of synthetic data. Although the bounds are sometimes blurry, we treat the developments in the statistical community separately from the developments in computer science.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The idea of releasing synthetic data instead of the real data was first proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Rubin (<a href="#bib.bib169" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>. In a discussion of another article, he suggested that his multiple imputation framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rubin, <a href="#bib.bib167" title="" class="ltx_ref">1978</a>, <a href="#bib.bib168" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite> could be used as an innovative disclosure protection strategy. He proposed treating the units that were not sampled for the survey as missing data and to multiply impute this “missing” information. Simple random samples from these imputed populations should then be disseminated to the public. (We note that in practice the two-step procedure of imputing the full population first and then sampling from it is not necessary. It suffices to draw a new sample from the sampling frame and to generate synthetic values for the survey variables of the sampled units.)
If the risk of releasing original records should be avoided completely, the records in the original sample can also be replaced by draws from the imputation model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to multiple imputation for nonresponse, valid inferences can be obtained from the synthetic datasets by analyzing each dataset separately and combining the estimates from each dataset using simple formulas to come up with the final estimates (see Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Obtaining valid inferences for the MI inspired approaches ‣ 30 years of synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> for details).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">An obvious advantage of the approach is that no original values are included in the released data (for this reason, this approach has been termed the <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fully synthetic data</span> approach in the literature to distinguish it from the <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">partially synthetic data</span> approach described below). Furthermore, synthetic values are generated for units that never participated in the survey. Thus, the level of protection is very high. However, this high level of protection comes at a price. The synthetic data are drawn from a model fitted to the original data, and the quality of the synthetic data directly depends on the quality of that model. Finding a model that reflects all relationships in a complex dataset with hundreds of variables and complicated logical constraints between the variables can be challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A closely related approach that overcomes the limitations of the fully synthetic approach was suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Little (<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>. With this approach, only the sensitive records and/or records that could be used for re-identification are replaced with synthetic values. Since some true values remain in the dataset, the approach has been termed the <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">partially synthetic data</span> approach. The approach offers some flexibility over the fully synthetic data approach. The agency can decide which part of the data needs to be synthesized. The synthesis can range from synthesizing only some records for a single variable, for example all income values for individuals with an income above a given threshold, to synthesizing all variables, basically mimicking the fully synthetic data approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A related idea for generating synthetic data was proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fienberg (<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">1994</a>)</cite>. He suggested using a smoothed estimate of the empirical cumulative function of the data and releasing bootstrap samples from this distribution. This approach was further developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fienberg
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Ten years after the initial proposal by Rubin and Little, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Raghunathan
et al.

Similar to multiple imputation for nonresponse, the multiple synthetic datasets are analyzed separately first and the results from the different analyses are combined using simple combining rules to obtain estimates for the first two moments for the statistic of interest. However, these combining rules differ slightly from the rules in the nonresponse context, and they also differ between full and partial synthesis. In 2012, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">Reiter and
Kinney</a></cite> identified another difference between the two synthesis approaches: posterior draws of the model parameters which are necessary for full synthesis (and also in the context of multiple imputation for nonresponse) are not required for partial synthesis. Several years later, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Raab
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> developed combining rules for a variant of the fully synthetic approach that can also be used if only one synthetic copy of the original data is available (see Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Obtaining valid inferences for the MI inspired approaches ‣ 30 years of synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> for further details).</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The earliest application of the synthetic data idea dates back to 1997, when the U.S. Federal Reserve Board decided to replace monetary values at high risk of disclosure in the Survey of Consumer Finances with synthetic values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kennickell, <a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Abowd and

The most complex synthetic data product generated so far was first released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2007: the SIPP synthetic beta <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abowd

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy brought a fundamental change in the way computer scientists think about privacy, which paved the way for synthetic data applications in the computer science literature. In a nutshell, differential privacy requires that changing one record in the database has a strictly limited impact on the results of a mechanism run on the data (we will offer a more detailed review of differential privacy in Section <a href="#S4.SS5" title="4.5 Differential private data synthesis ‣ 4 A taxonomy of synthetic data approaches ‣ 30 years of synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.5</span></a>). Note the change of focus from the data to the mechanism, which implies that it is no longer the data that needs to be adjusted to achieve privacy, but the mechanism. This concept of privacy aligns much better with the ideas of synthetic data. All that is required is to find a synthesis mechanism that satisfies the requirements of differential privacy. Soon after the concept of DP was established in 2006, the first papers on differentially private synthetic data started to appear.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The advent of GANs proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Goodfellow
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> resulted in a boost in synthetic data research and applications in the computer science literature. This is probably not surprising as synthetic data are generated as a by-product with any GAN model. We will review GANs in more detail in Section <a href="#S4.SS4.SSS1" title="4.4.1 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) ‣ 4.4 Computer Science approaches ‣ 4 A taxonomy of synthetic data approaches ‣ 30 years of synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4.1</span></a>, but the basic setup of GANs consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator produces fake data trying to fool the discriminator, which tries to distinguish the fake data from the real data. Both neural networks are improved in an iterative process. The final data produced by the generator can be seen as a variant of synthetic data. GANs turned out to be extremely successful for image and speech recognition and natural language understanding. Early applications of GANs for data synthesis also focused on generating synthetic images (see, for example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Denton
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>). However, the approach was quickly adapted for synthesizing microdata (microdata are often referred to as tabular data in the computer science literature. Thus, many approaches explicitly refer to this in the title of the paper or the labeling of the algorithm to distinguish the approach from other applications that focus on images and other types of data). However, the adoption of GANs for microdata poses additional challenges. Microdata often have categorical variables that are sparse and correlations among variable are often weaker than, for example, relationships between pixels that are located next to each other. The position of variables in a dataset is also only rarely informative for microdata, as the individual records are typically independent. Relationships between variable therefore have to be modeled without the help of any kind of spatial information.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As indicated in the introduction, Rubin’s initial proposal for data synthesis was motivated by his prior work on multiple imputation for nonresponse. Given the close relationships to those ideas, it seems natural to also adopt the simple combining procedures from the multiple imputation literature (Rubin’s combining rules) to obtain valid point and variance estimates from the synthetic data. However, the synthetic data approaches differ in two important aspects from the original framework. With full synthesis as proposed by Rubin, synthetic data are only generated for a simple random sample of the population. This extra sampling step needs to be taken into account. With partial synthesis, the synthesis models are estimated using the full data and not only the fully observed subset of the data, as done in the nonresponse context. These deviations imply that the combining procedures also need to be adjusted. The correct rules for fully synthetic data were derived in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Raghunathan
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib151" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>, those for partially synthetic data are presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Reiter (<a href="#bib.bib154" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>. Later, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Reiter (<a href="#bib.bib158" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005c</a>)</cite> also derived the multivariate analogs that can be used for multi-component testing based on Wald tests or Likelihood ratio tests. We will only review the combining rules for univariate estimates here borrowing heavily from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Drechsler (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011c</a>)</cite>. The interested reader is referred to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Reiter and
Raghunathan (<a href="#bib.bib164" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>, which offers a full review of all combining rules for synthetic data and also for the nonresponse context.</p>

A disadvantage of this variance estimate is that it can become
negative. For that reason, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Reiter (<a href="#bib.bib153" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>)</cite> suggested a slightly
modified variance estimator that is always positive but will tend to overestimate the true variance,

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the broad range of synthetic data approaches and use cases, finding a one-dimensional taxonomy that fully covers all variants of synthetic data is difficult. Beyond the obvious distinction between approaches inspired by the ideas of multiple imputation and approaches that originated in computer science, we suggest three alternative classification schemes: sequential vs. joint modeling approaches, parametric vs. machine learning inspired approaches and approaches that offer formal privacy guarantees vs. those that do not. Obviously, other classifications such as partial vs. full synthesis would be possible. However, we feel that classifying the approaches along these lines is obvious and does not require a separate discussion. Instead, we list a final class of synthesis approaches that are extensions of the MI based approaches. These approaches are treated separately, as they typically require different procedures to obtain valid inferences compared to those discussed in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Obtaining valid inferences for the MI inspired approaches ‣ 30 years of synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the early applications of synthetic data relied on a sequential modeling approach, in which each variable is synthesized sequentially using models that condition on any variables that have been synthesized previously or variables that remain unchanged in the final data. The underlying idea is that any joint distribution can be rewritten as a product of conditional distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The sequential regression approach offers great flexibility, as different models can be used for each variable. These might include parametric models such as linear regression, logit models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Reiter, <a href="#bib.bib157" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005b</a>)</cite>, or models based on quantile regressions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pistner
et al., <a href="#bib.bib143" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, but also any machine learning tool that enables random draws from a conditional distribution, such as CART or random forests.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to the sequential modeling approach, joint modeling aims at directly specifying the joint distribution of the data. While early approaches such as the IPSO method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Burridge, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite> relied on a multivariate normality assumption that is seldom justified with real data, more flexible models have been proposed recently. For categorical data, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hu
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> demonstrated that an approach based on a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Products of Multinomials (DPMPM) can offer high utility in real data applications. The approach was later extended to also allow for structural zeros, that is, impossible variable combinations such as married toddlers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Manrique-Vallier and
Hu, <a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Synthesis approaches based on DPMPMs are implemented in the R package NPBayesImputeCat <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hu
et al., <a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. A related approach based on Quasi-Mutinomial distributions was proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hu and

et al. (<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> showed good performance of Dirichlet Process Normal Mixture Models for synthesizing continuous business data.

et al., <a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Furthermore, many of the synthesis strategies used in computer science such as Generative Adversarial Networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Goodfellow

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The methodology for obtaining valid inferences based on synthetic data reviewed in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Obtaining valid inferences for the MI inspired approaches ‣ 30 years of synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> above relies on the assumption that the synthesis models are correctly specified, that is, they match the true data generating process. An additional requirement is that the synthesis model is congenial to the analysis model to be run on the synthetic data. In broad terms, congeniality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Meng, <a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">1994</a>)</cite> means that the synthesis model is based on the same (modeling) assumptions as the analysis model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To be fair, as it is impossible to anticipate all analyses that will be run on the synthetic data, achieving congeniality is typically a hopeless goal in practice. Still, it has been shown in the nonresponse context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Meng, <a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">1994</a>)</cite> that approximately valid inferences can be obtained if the synthesis model encompasses the analysis model, that is, it contains more variables than the analysis model. Intuitively, this makes sense: adding a predictor variable during synthesis that in reality is conditionally independent of the variable to be synthesized given the other predictors in the model will not do much harm. It might unnecessarily increase the variance from synthesis, but it will not introduce any bias. However, omitting important variables will introduce bias, as the relationship between the omitted variable and the synthetic variable will be attenuated in the synthetic data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Based on this reasoning, it is generally recommended to use a rich set of predictors in the synthesis model, ideally conditioning on all other variables in the dataset and also including interaction and squared terms if possible (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Little and
Raghunathan (<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>)</cite> for a similar argument in the nonresponse context). However, this strategy is typically not feasible when using parametric models, as many datasets contain dozens of variables. Especially with categorical variables, multicollinearity issues and the problem of perfect prediction often imply that fitting parametric models containing many variables is no longer possible and uncongeniality becomes a major concern.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome this problem, researchers started exploring alternative synthesis strategies, borrowing ideas from the machine learning literature. In 2005, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Reiter (<a href="#bib.bib159" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005d</a>)</cite> suggested using Classification and Regression Trees (CART). <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Caiola and
Reiter (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> later extended these ideas to random forests, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Drechsler (<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> developed strategies to adapt Support Vector Machines for data synthesis. Synthesis strategies based on genetic algorithms were explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chen
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chen
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. All these approaches have the advantage that they <span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_inline-quote ltx_outerquote">“let the data speak for themselves”</span>, that is, they might automatically identify higher order relationships that might easily be missed when specifying parametric models. Furthermore, they are not affected by multicollinearity or perfect prediction problems and can still be directly applied if the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. In an evaluation study, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Drechsler and
Reiter (<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> compared the different approaches and found that CART models offered the best results in terms of preserving the information from the original data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the computer science approach to synthetic data, the problem of uncongeniality was never explicitly considered.

The discriminator (network) is trained to discriminate between real and synthetic data. The discriminator tries to minimize the misclassification error while the generator loss is calculated from the discriminator’s classification – it gets penalized if it does not fool the discriminator. The standard combined loss function was described by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Goodfellow

In comparison to GANs, a VAE has three instead of two networks, which learn complimentary tasks: an encoder network, a decoder network and a discriminator. The encoder network maps the data onto a latent representation, while the decoder network tries to reconstruct. As with GANs, the discriminator network decides for each given sample whether it is real data or data generated by the decoder network.

In the next step, a model is fitted using the information contained in the data to estimate the propensity scores, that is, to estimate the probability for each record to belong to the synthetic data. If the synthetic data would be an exact copy of the original data, the data would not offer any information to discriminate between the data sources and the distribution of the estimated propensity scores would be the same for both datasets. Thus, one way to measure the utility of the synthetic data is to evaluate the difference in the distribution of the propensity score between the original data and the synthetic data. Various metrics can be used for this purpose. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bowen
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> suggest estimating the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the two distributions (they call this measure SPECKS for Synthetic data generation; Propensity score matching; Empirical Comparison via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance). Alternatively, the Mann–Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) can also be used.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">These measures explicitly focus on measuring the usefulness of the synthetic data for a specific analysis task. For example, a straightforward visualization of the analytical validity is to plot estimates of interest (means, regression coefficients, etc.) obtained from the original data against the same estimates obtained from the synthetic data. If the utility is high, the coefficients should cluster around the 45 degree line.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A downside of this evaluation is that it does not account for the inherent uncertainty of the estimates. Larger deviations between the estimates might be acceptable, if the sampling error is large, for example, if the estimate of interest is based on a small subset of the data. The same deviation might be problematic for a statistic based on the entire sample. A popular measure that also takes the uncertainty of the estimates into account is the <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">confidence interval overlap</span> measure proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Karr
et al. (<a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>. It measures the relative average overlap between the confidence interval obtained from the original data and the confidence interval obtained from the synthetic data. An overlap measure close to one indicates that approximately the same inferential conclusions will be drawn irrespective of whether the synthetic data or the original data were used for the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given the increased relevance of machine learning approaches, another utility metric gained popularity in recent years, especially in the computer science literature: <em id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">machine learning efficacy</em>. Utility measures of this type, which are also referred to as measures of <em id="S5.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model comparability</em>, assess whether machine learning models trained on the synthetic data give similar results compared to when they were trained on the original data. For these evaluations, the models of interest are typically trained on both the synthetic data and the original data and then the performance of the models is compared based on the same set of test records, which is obtained from the original data. The utility of the synthetic data is considered high, if classical evaluation criteria such as accuracy, F1 score, etc., are similar irrespective of whether the models were trained using the original data or the synthetic data. Sometimes, utility is also evaluated by assessing whether using the synthetic data for model training would lead to the same ranking of various machine learning models. For example, if the original data would suggest that a classifier based on a multilayer perceptron performs better than a random forest and the random forest is better than logistic regression, the same ranking should be found if the synthetic data were used for model training.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">These measures represent the first step when evaluating the usefulness of the generated data. We treat them separately from the other two measures, as they do not necessarily focus on measuring the validity of specific analyses that might be important for the users of the data. They also do not try to directly assess the similarity of the original and the synthetic data in one global statistic. Their main aim is to get a first impression of the quality of the synthetic data, and, unlike the global measures, they can help to identify aspects of the synthesis process that might still need to be improved.
These measures can be divided into three groups: graphical evaluations, plausibility checks, and computing various goodness-of-fit measures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Graphical evaluations typically include strategies such as side-by-side plots of the marginal distributions of the synthetic and the original data or contour plots for comparing bi-variate distributions. They also include visual comparisons of conditional distributions such as the income distribution for males and females or for different age groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the plausibility checks, it is important to involve subject-matter experts that regularly work with the data. This is crucial as not all inconsistencies are immediately obvious. For example, while it might be straightforward to identify problems such as married two-year olds, it is much more difficult to judge which year-to-year change in turnover would be considered plausible for an establishment in a given industry in a given year.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, any goodness-of-fit measure can be used to assess the similarity for specific aspects of the original and synthetic data. For example, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic can be used for each continuous variable in the dataset. Cross-tabulations of several variables (discretizing continuous variables if necessary) can be evaluated using the <math id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\chi^{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">χ</mi><mn id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜒</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p4.1.m1.1c">\chi^{2}</annotation></semantics></math> statistic or the likelihood ratio statistic. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Voas and
Williamson (<a href="#bib.bib189" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite> discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various metrics. However, it must be noted that the statistics should not be used to test for statistically significant differences between the original and the synthetic data. Given that the synthetic data are generated based on information from the original data, the two samples cannot be treated as independent—an assumption underlying most goodness-of-fit tests. Thus, any p-values computed using the standard test procedure would be misleading. Nevertheless, the value of the test statistic can still be used to compare the performance of different synthesis strategies. Furthermore, the test statistic can also be used as a metric to identify potential problems with the quality of the synthetic data. For example, if the test statistic is high for many of the cross-tabulations involving age, this serves as an indicator that the synthesis of the age variable needs to be improved.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From a risk perspective, there is a fundamental difference between disseminating partially or fully synthetic data. With partial synthesis, there still exists a one-to-one mapping between the original data and the synthetic data. With fully synthetic data, this is no longer the case. In fact, with this approach, the synthetic data does not have to be of the same size as the original data. This implies that measuring the risk of re-identification, as commonly done for other disclosure protection strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Reiter, <a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005a</a>; Skinner and
Shlomo, <a href="#bib.bib175" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>; Shlomo, <a href="#bib.bib173" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, is not meaningful for fully synthetic data. However, this does not mean that fully synthetic data can be assumed to have no risk of spilling sensitive information. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Manrique-Vallier and
Hu (<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> illustrate using real data that if a fully conditional specification approach (which is commonly applied when using multiple imputation in the nonresponse context) is used for CART-based synthesis, there is a risk that the synthesizer simply replicates most of the original records. The problem arises as the approach always conditions on all other variables in the dataset. With complex datasets containing many (categorical) variables, this can lead to situations in which the values of the variable to be synthesized are completely deterministic given the other variables. The CART synthesizer can get stuck in such a situation, simply replicating the records from the original data. While such a problem can easily be avoided by not using the fully conditional specification approach (the approach offers no advantages in the context of synthetic data), this example still highlights that it would be naïve to assume that fully synthetic data will never pose any threats of disclosing sensitive information. However, measuring these risks is challenging and research in this area is still limited.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We start this section by reviewing the approaches that have been proposed in the literature to assess risks for fully synthetic data. In principle, these measures can also be used to assess the risks for partially synthetic data, while the risk measures that we review in the second part of this section are only useful for partial synthesis as they try to assess the risk of re-identification for the generated data. We also refer the interested reader to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hu (<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, which contains a detailed review of Bayesian risk measures for synthetic data.</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Even though the link between the original and the synthetic data is broken with full synthesis, some agencies still evaluate how many synthetic records have a unique match in the original data. The reasoning behind this evaluation is that the agencies are concerned about perceived risks. Survey respondents might be concerned if they find a synthetic record that exactly matches their own record, especially if their combination of attributes makes them unique in the original data.</p>

The average of these distances across all synthetic records is then used as a risk measure. From a practical perspective, it is not obvious which risk this measure is supposed to quantify. Even if the average distance is small, the distance could be large for some records. A potential attacker would never know which records have small distance and even if the distance is small, this does not necessarily imply a risk if the closest record is in a high density area of the data distribution.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another class of risk measures for fully synthetic data focuses on the fact that the synthesis models themselves can leak some information regarding the content of the original data. For example, when using a fully saturated log-linear model to synthesize a set of categorical variables combined with vague prior information, the existence of certain attribute combinations in the synthetic data reveals that the same combination must have been present in the original data. In the computer science literature, these types of risk evaluations are called membership attacks, as an attacker will learn that a certain record was present in the original data. Various strategies to estimate the risks from membership attacks have been proposed in the literature. Most of these approaches assume that the attacker already knows the true values for some target records and uses this information to learn whether these units are included in the original data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Stadler
et al., <a href="#bib.bib178" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. These evaluations are based on the strong assumption that the attacker is not interested in learning something new about a unit contained in the data. Instead, the only goal is to learn whether the unit was part of the original data. There are situations in which learning this information is considered unacceptable: some laws explicitly state that such risks must be avoided. In addition, sometimes the fact that someone is contained in a database already reveals sensitive information, if the database only contains a specific subgroup of the population such as the Survey of Prison Inmates conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in the United States.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As indicated above, most of the risk measures from the previous section can also be used for partial synthesis. However, the fact that synthetic records are only generated for units that were already included in the original data implies that each record in the synthetic data has a unique match in the original data. Thus, one way to measure the risk with partially synthetic data is to evaluate whether an attacker would be able to re-identify some records in the synthetic data. Building on previous work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Reiter (<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005a</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Reiter and

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">7 </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The interest in synthetic data has been growing steadily over the last thirty years. While the focus was on methodological aspects and statistical properties during the first decade, first applications started to appear around the turn of the century. The great success of GANs, which always require generating synthetic data even if the final goal is not to disseminate these data, had a huge impact on the synthetic data movement, especially in the computer science community. The availability of easy to use software such as synthpop <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Raab
et al., <a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> or the synthetic data vault <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Patki
et al., <a href="#bib.bib142" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> also meant that more statistical agencies and other data disseminating organizations were able to explore the approach without the need to implement the synthesizers from scratch.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we reviewed the historic developments of the synthetic data approach, offered a taxonomy of approaches, and discussed methods to measure risk and utility of the generated data. For organizational reasons, we treated the statistical approach separately from the computer science approach. While it is true that the developments in the two fields mostly happened independently with little exchange between the disciplines, the lines have always been blurry (for example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Machanavajjhala et al. (<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> already integrate ideas from both fields), and the increasing number of collaborations between statisticians and computer scientists in recent years will hopefully make this distinction obsolete in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, most of the applications of the synthetic data approach do not use the synthetic data as the final product. The synthetic data are either used for training purposes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Forbes and
Zealand, <a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> or to develop software code in preparation for working with the real data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(de Wolf, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Raab
et al., <a href="#bib.bib150" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Even in those cases in which final access to the real data is not possible, the data providers typically guarantee that they will run the final results on the original data and report back the results if they can be released without violating confidentiality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Benedetto
et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Burman et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. This implies that procedures for obtaining valid variance estimates from the synthetic data as discussed in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Obtaining valid inferences for the MI inspired approaches ‣ 30 years of synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> are less relevant in practice, and the fact that many of the computer science approaches never achieved this goal is less of a concern.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For those cases in which access to the original data cannot be provided, verification servers can be a useful alternative. These servers hold both the synthetic and the original data. Researchers can submit their analysis of interest to the server, it runs the analysis on both datasets, and reports back some fidelity measure how close the results from the synthetic data are to the results based on the original data. Compared to the guarantee of running the final models on the original data, verification servers have the advantage that the procedure can be automated. Since the server only reports a fidelity measure and not the actual results, no manual output checking is required. This means that the server could also be used frequently during data preparation and not only for the final model. However, some care must be taken, as even fidelity measures might spill sensitive information. Developing measures that are informative but at the same time are guaranteed not to spill sensitive information is an area of active research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Reiter
et al., <a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>; McClure and
Reiter, <a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012b</a>; Barrientos
et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Yu and Reiter, <a href="#bib.bib200" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A systematic comparison between the approaches developed in the different fields is currently lacking, although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Little et al. (<a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> offers some first insights. The authors compared several synthesis strategies based on CART models, Bayesian Networks, and two GAN implementations (tableGAN and CTGAN). They found that the sequential-regression-based CART approach offered the highest utility, but also the highest risk. One of the GANs (tableGAN) resulted in unacceptably low utility, while CTGAN and the approach based on Bayesian Networks performed almost similarly. However, this evaluation was based on only one dataset and also relied on the default settings of the different software packages that were used for the different synthesis approaches. More extensive evaluations of the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches that have been proposed in the literature would be an important area of future research.</p>
