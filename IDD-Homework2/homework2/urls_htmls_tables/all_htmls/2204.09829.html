<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, blockchain-based technologies are being developed in various industries to improve data security. In the context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a chain-based network is one of the most notable applications of blockchain technology. IIoT devices have become increasingly prevalent in our digital world, especially in support of developing smart factories. Although blockchain is a powerful tool, it is vulnerable to cyber attacks. Detecting anomalies in blockchain-based IIoT networks in smart factories is crucial in protecting networks and systems from unexpected attacks. In this paper, we use Federated Learning (FL) to build a threat hunting framework called Block Hunter to automatically hunt for attacks in blockchain-based IIoT networks. Block Hunter utilizes a cluster-based architecture for anomaly detection combined with several machine learning models in a federated environment. To the best of our knowledge, Block Hunter is the first federated threat hunting model in IIoT networks that identifies anomalous behavior while preserving privacy. <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Our results prove the efficiency of the Block Hunter in detecting anomalous activities with high accuracy and minimum required bandwidth.</span></p>

technological trajectory of blockchain makes it a valuable tool in many areas, including healthcare, military, finance and networking, via its immutable and tamper-proof data security advantages. With the ever-increasing use of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, the world is inevitably becoming a smarter interconnected environment; especially factories are becoming more intelligent and efficient as technology advances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> IIoT is considered a subcategory of the Internet of Things (IoT). There are, however, differences between IoT and IIoT in terms of security requirements. While the IoT makes consumers’ lives easier and more convenient, the IIoT aims to increase production safety and efficiency. IIoT devices are mainly used in B2B (business-to-business) settings, while IoT devices are mostly considered in B2C (business-to-consumer) environments. This would lead to a different threat profile for IIoT networks compared to their IoT counterparts where device-to-device transactions are of utmost importance</span>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">IIoT networks provide an umbrella for supporting many applications and arm us to respond to users’ needs, especially in an industry setting such as smart factories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Blockchain technology advantages lead to its wide adoption in IIoT-based networks such as smart factories, smart homes/buildings, smart farms, smart cities, connected drones, and healthcare systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. While the focus of this paper is on the security of blockchain-based IIoT networks in smart factories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, the suggested framework may be used in other IIoT settings as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In modern smart factories, many devices are connected to the public networks, and many activities are supported by smart systems such as temperature monitoring systems, Internet-enabled lights, IP cameras, and IP phones. These devices <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">are storing private and sensitive data and may offer safety-critical services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite></span>. <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">As the number of IIoT devices in smart factories increases, the main issue will be storing, collecting, and sharing data securely. Industrial, critical, and personal data are therefore at risk in such a situation. </span> Blockchain technology can ensure data integrity inside and outside of smart factories through strong authentication and ensure the availability of communication backbones. Despite this, privacy and security issues are significant challenges in IIoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> The probability of fraudulent activity occurring in blockchain-based networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is an important issue.

In addition, when ML models are frequently updated to respond to new threats and detect anomalies, malicious adversaries can launch causative/data poisoning attacks to degrade the ML model deliberately.

FL allows edge devices to collaborate during the training stage while all data stays on the device. We can train the model on the device itself instead of sending the data to another place, and only the updates of the model are shared across the network.</p>

In addition, FL ensures multiple actors construct robust machine learning models without sharing data, addressing fundamental privacy, data security, and digital rights management challenges. Considering these characteristics, this paper uses an FL-based anomaly-detection framework called Block Hunter capable of detecting attack payloads in blockchain-based IIoT networks.</p>

A transaction represents the exchange of sensitive factory information between parties during working in the blockchain network. There are several inputs and outputs in a transaction. Blocks consist of a list of transactions, a reference to the previous block, and a hash. Every block is made up of transactions that the block creator, referred to as the miner, has accepted into its memory pool from the previous block. <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Considering rigid industrial standards that should be followed when designing and implementing smart factories, it is practical to assume that the functionality of smart factories in each cluster is the same.</span></p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Detecting anomalous activities is a significant contributor to automatically protecting a system from unexpected attacks. Anomalies in blockchain must be detected by sending each block of data to a central server for each block update. This is not efficient and also imposes privacy concerns. FL solutions are promising in tackling this issue. We use FL to update the model frequently and to obtain a global model for detecting an anomaly. After learning about each smart factory’s data, devices, and service provider, the model’s parameters will be sent to the <span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> parameter server</span> for aggregation and to update our general model.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Smart factories have sensitive data, so storing it on the blockchain with its limited storage is both financially and computationally costly.

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The premise behind the development of an anomaly detection framework for the blockchain-based IIoT networks in smart factories lies in providing a new decentralized system based on FL that leverages all smart factory data while protecting their privacy. Additionally, we will reach a point where we need to attend to the issue of a fork in the blockchain scope during anomaly detection. In some instances, devices or nodes do not agree on the state of the blockchain, leading to the fork issue in the blockchain. When blockchain-based applications are being developed, forks become more concerned because they have the potential to be used for malicious purposes. Indeed, a global ML model can use all of the collected information from previous forks to detect anomalies during training. This approach has the advantage that while attacks may only happen once within a smart factory, they behave the same way when repeated against other smart factories over time. Hence, information on past attacks may help us blacklist them and prevent them from occurring in the future. The advantage of FL is clear since it will train the global ML model for anomaly detection.</p>

We used the specific information for training anomaly detection in each local ML model that contains sensitive smart factory data, the features of previous forks, and the number and type of malicious transactions that occurred. As a result, we can hunt an anomaly by Block Hunter in a blockchain-based IIoT network for smart factories. To protect the privacy of the data, we only share the parameters of trained models instead of the original data from smart factories and their blockchain.

Some of the metrics include throughput, reliability, energy consumption, and latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we propose blockchain technology’s cluster-based formation model for smart factories. Cluster-based architecture provides more efficient use of resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and throughput during the blockchain run in each smart factory. Clustering reduces the computational complexity in the creation of the underlying network through a hierarchical approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.7" class="ltx_p">An example of a classifier-based anomaly detection algorithm is the neural encoder-decoder model. The proposed anomaly detection framework develops a neural encoder-decoder model that summarizes the information about the blockchain’s status and transactions and then rebuilds the initial data from this space. Encoding/decoding preserves the data’s basic properties when the current status is consistent. Differently, anomalous situations exhibit inconsistent values, ultimately leading to a failing reconstruction. In an encoder-decoder, this quantity would be paraphrased as noise and therefore would be failing when reconstructing. Therefore, the difference between the initial and reconstructed values would highlight the anomalous and abnormal situation, thereby triggering an alert <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
Neural encoder-decoder models analyze sequences of temporally sorted events.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.9" class="ltx_p">The Isolation Forest (IF) model falls under the Tree-based anomaly detection algorithms category. The approach has gained much universal acceptance in recent years because it is unsupervised. Isolation forest is a concept based on the idea that it’s more prudent to isolate data anomalies rather than generalize the norms. It’s a recursive and random partitioning process to isolate the anomalous data point in the dataset until it simply describes the stored data. A tree structure represents the recursive partition. A forest of isolation trees is the foundation of the isolation forest algorithm, where cells in the dataset are randomly selected from the data to form a forest of normal and outlier cells. These trees are binary trees that have zero or two child nodes, and an isolation forest contains isolation trees of this type <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.

Our cluster-based local outlier factor (CBLOF) model belongs to the classifier-based algorithm-based anomaly detection category. Within this algorithm’s anomaly detection methodology, the data is clustered into clusters, based on which anomaly scores can be computed similar to those of the local outlier factor algorithm and so on. This algorithm’s underlying principle of anomaly detection is based on clustering data sets together. This algorithm creates clusters using groups in a dataset by arbitrary clustering algorithms that assign a specific observation to a cluster.

Bitcoin Simulator is an open-source bitcoin simulator developed on NS3. The Bitcoin Simulator has been tested with NS3. Also, we consider LENA as an NS-3 module to simulate 3GPP networks. The NR module is a pluggable module for NS-3 that can be used to simulate New Radio (NR) cellular networks. NS-3 supports the widest variety of network models and protocols and supports the greatest variety of networking devices. Indeed, wireless networks and protocols rely on the NS-3 to determine their performance. Therefore, the assessment of the proposed federated framework will do on the performance metrics such as the impact of block size, number of blocks, number of IoT devices, and number of miners.

The non-cluster model combined blockchain technology with the standard network model and did not consider and divide it into cluster architecture. It has no features and typologies of cluster-based architecture such as adjacencies with other clusters or part of the network, flexibility, and scalability during run time. Conversely, in cluster-based architecture, each cluster has adjacencies with other clusters and supports the dynamic characteristics of a network.</span> In the following, we address the impact of Block generation, the impact of the Block size, and the impact of the number of miners in the evaluation. <span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> In the proposed framework, the public blockchain network is deployed among clusters that include smart factories.

<br class="ltx_break"></span>Block generation interval is regarded as an important metric for measuring the performance of blockchain networks. If we have an organized topology and structure, the block generation will be more efficient to support nodes than in a distributed network with a solid and organized structure. Further, since blocks are generated more frequently in individual clusters instead of generated in batches that consume a considerable amount of bandwidth, we can better manage and use the bandwidth. Fig. 3(a) shows the bandwidth efficiency of the cluster-based design (proposed architecture) compared to the non-cluster-based design.</p>

<br class="ltx_break"></span>Block size has a significant impact on the performance of blockchain. The block size determines the highest number of transactions that can be approved within a block. This size, thus, controls the throughput (transactions/second) obtained by the proposed design. Larger blocks cause more sluggish propagation in each cluster than smaller blocks. In Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(c), we show that the bandwidth consumption and throughput increase with increasing block size from 0.5 MB to 8 MB. This directly impacts both the bandwidth and throughput of the proposed model. As expected, Block Hunter has a higher performance because of better network communication, efficient topology management, and minimized delay.</p>

Based on the cluster-based structure in Block Hunter, it is almost certain that this system’s accuracy is acceptable during anomaly hunting, as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-C1 nomaly detection rate ‣ V-C Experimental Analysis ‣ V Discussion &amp; Evaluation ‣ Block Hunter: Federated Learning for Cyber Threat Hunting in Blockchain-based IIoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. The Block Hunter framework also works perfectly as the number of transactions and clusters increases.</p>

knowledge, Block Hunter is the first federated threat hunting
model in IIoT networks that identifies anomalous behavior while preserving privacy. We used FL to build a threat hunting framework that utilizes a cluster-based architecture to formulate an anomaly detection combined with several machine learning models. Our results indicate the superior performance of our model in automatically hunting for anomalies while preserving data privacy.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed the Block Hunter framework to hunt anomalies in blockchain-based IIoT smart factories using a federated learning approach. Block Hunter uses a cluster-based architecture to reduce resources and improve the throughput of blockchain-based IIoT networks hunting. The Block Hunter framework was evaluated using a variety of machine learning algorithms (NED, IF, CBLOF, <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>-means, PCA) to detect anomalies. We also examined the impacts of block generation interval, block size, and different miners on the performance of the Block Hunter. Using generative adversarial networks (GAN) to design and implement a block hunter-like framework would be an interesting future research work. Furthermore, <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> designing and applying IIoT-related blockchain networks with different</span> consensus algorithms would also be worth investigating in the future.</p>
