<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) designs introduce intermediate aggregator nodes between clients and the global federated learning server in order to reduce communication costs and distribute server load. One side effect is that machine learning model replication at scale comes “for free” as part of the HFL process: model replicas are hosted at the client end, intermediate nodes, and the global server level and are readily available for serving inference requests. This creates opportunities for efficient model serving but simultaneously couples the training and serving processes and calls for their joint orchestration. This is particularly important for <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">continual learning</em>, where serving a model while (re)training it periodically, upon specific triggers, or continuously, takes place over shared infrastructure spanning the computing continuum. Consequently, training and inference workloads can interfere with detrimental effects on performance. To address this issue, we propose an inference load-aware HFL orchestration scheme, which makes informed decisions on HFL configuration, considering knowledge about inference workloads and the respective processing capacity. Applying our scheme to a continual learning use case in the transportation domain, we demonstrate that by optimizing aggregator node placement and device-aggregator association, significant inference latency savings can be achieved while communication costs are drastically reduced compared to flat centralized federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional approach to machine/deep learning (ML/DL) is to train an ML model with data collected on a centralized cloud server and make it available for inference either by hosting it in the cloud or, more recently, serving it directly from end devices following the edge computing paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Both training and inference are, however, challenged in different ways.
On the one hand, data often tend to be distributed across various devices, and collecting all data to a central server raises logistical and privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, and despite the proliferation of AI accelerators of different scales, serving inference requests at the same time in a timely, accurate, and private manner is a hard, multi-faceted problem that calls for sophisticated edge-cloud synergy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a response to some of these challenges and has gained significant popularity.
In FL, clients train an ML model on local data and upload the result of their computation to a central server for aggregation.
The server then produces and redistributes an updated global model, starting a new training round.
This iterative process continues until some convergence criterion is met. FL operates under distinctly different assumptions than traditional deep learning: the number of participating nodes is often high, data are unbalanced and often not independent and identically distributed (non-IID), and performance depends on the communication capabilities of participating entities, which are often heterogeneous, resource-constrained and unreliable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Moreover, even when the number of participating devices is high, each device typically only holds a relatively small data volume.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In its default centralized configuration, FL can suffer from increased network costs. Instead of uploading raw data, clients must exchange ML model copies with the FL server, which is particularly costly for long-lasting training processes and large DL models. At the same time, large-scale synchronous federated learning tasks require significant network capacity at the server end to deal with simultaneous model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
These limitations motivate <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">hierarchical</em> federated learning (HFL), where frequent aggregations can be enabled on the edge network, avoiding extensive cloud aggregations without sacrificing learning accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In a hierarchical FL process, the key decision is how to appropriately cluster FL clients in groups and designate local aggregator nodes per cluster to optimize for specific performance criteria, such as communication cost minimization or FL convergence time. As a side effect, ML model replication at hosts in the computing continuum comes “for free” as a natural part of the HFL process: besides client devices and the cloud, model replicas are now found at local aggregation points and are usable for serving inference requests, potentially with low latency due to proximity, and provided that privacy requirements allow it. At the same time, though, this creates a coupling between training and inference and calls for their <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">joint orchestration</em>. This coupling becomes more important in <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">continual learning (CL)</em> scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, where training and inference processes overlap and compete for compute and network resources. The CL paradigm provides a realistic setting reflecting real-world learning processes, with new tasks and new data, potentially with different distributions, emerging over time. As such, CL may involve retraining an ML model while serving it, which is challenging to achieve with high performance when sharing the same resource-constrained infrastructure, as is often the case in FL. This challenge has started receiving attention only recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Continuous learning, also known as lifelong learning, has been proposed by Thrun <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and is a well-researched topic with extensive literature. It involves learning continuously from streaming data, developing a model based on previous learning, and then being able to reapply, adapt, and generalize it to new situations. Continuous learning and continual learning are often overlooked in federated learning, which is typically limited to one-time training. In practice, however, a model may need to be retrained over time to maintain its accuracy. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> present a comprehensive survey on continual learning, mainly focusing on the theoretical foundations, representative methods, and practical applications to address catastrophic forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and maintain model performance. Le et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> present a federated continuous learning scheme (FCL) based on broad learning (FCL-BL), which proposes a weighted processing strategy to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem and develops a local-independent training solution for fast and accurate training. For an overview of existing FCL approaches, related challenges, and classification tasks, the reader is referred to the work of Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
We should note that the aforementioned studies <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">do not focus on service orchestration aspects of FCL processes and do not address resource contention between (continuous) training and inference</em>.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most research on federated learning focuses on model training (e.g., model pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, gradient compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, etc.) rather than the inference stage (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>). Especially in continuous learning, where models need to be constantly updated, it can happen that inference requests and training overlap.
One of the first papers that emphasizes the problem of joint optimization of model training and inference is by Han et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
To characterize the clients’ inference performance, the authors introduce the notion of the age of the model to represent how much the models on the client side differ from the global model.
Another challenge mentioned in the paper is the close coupling between clients’ decisions, including participation probability in FL, model download probability, and service rates.
To address these challenges, the authors offer an online problem approximation that reduces complexity and optimizes resources for model training and inference. <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Our work shares a similar motivation but focuses on the hierarchical setting</em>. Despite the extensive literature on HFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, we are not aware of any works that jointly consider training and inference serving in HFL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From a use-case perspective, one area where continuous learning and federated learning are often required is Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP), which is also the application scenario we experiment with in this work (§ <a href="#S5" title="V Evaluation ‣ Inference Load-Aware Orchestration for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>). Predicting traffic flow is crucial for reducing congestion and improving transportation efficiency in smart cities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In TFP, distributed sensors measure traffic flow and train local models to predict how the traffic flow will evolve in the future. Due to the constantly changing traffic situation, the models have to be retrained continuously.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> present CTFed, a hierarchical FL approach to train Graph Neural Networks for TFP, clustering clients based on the similarity of their local models.
Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> propose an FL-based gated recurrent unit neural network algorithm (FedGRU). Yuan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, on the other hand, propose an FL scheme based on the Spatial-Temporal Long and Short-Term Networks (FedSTN) algorithm for TFP.
To integrate external factors into TFP, a Semantic Capture Network (SCN) is introduced to capture the regional flow relationship and the influence of Point of Interest (POI) on TFP. Hu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> propose an FL-based spatial-temporal traffic demand prediction model (FedSTTDP) while ensuring data security and privacy.

While the technical details of such a system are outside the scope of this paper, in this section, we provide its high-level overview and demonstrate how the functionality we present fits into this framework. We apply a two-level orchestration approach, depicted in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III System architecture ‣ Inference Load-Aware Orchestration for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Our design relies on two main components. The first is a <span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">general purpose orchestrator</span> (GPO), such as Kubernetes, to enable the collection of information about the underlying compute infrastructure, e.g., nodes capable of hosting HFL service components, and manage the deployment of these components as containerized microservices distributed over the computing continuum. The second is a special-purpose, <span id="S3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HFL-specific service orchestrator</span>.

This information is provided as the input for the <em id="S3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HFL clustering</em> mechanism, whose role is to form a hierarchy of FL clients and local aggregation nodes, solving the optimization problems therein – a major focus of this paper is on this mechanism in particular (see Section <a href="#S4" title="IV The inference-aware HFL orchestration problem ‣ Inference Load-Aware Orchestration for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>). The output of the clustering mechanism prescribes a specific HFL configuration, which is eventually translated to (i) an actual containerized deployment implemented by the GPO at the instruction of the learning controller and, in turn, (ii) a concrete distributed HFL service instance, managed by the learning controller and implemented by microservices running on client devices, edge nodes, and the cloud. Besides assigning FL devices to aggregator nodes, and depending on the specific instantiation of our orchestration system, the clustering mechanism may decide on further FL service parameters, such as the number of local epochs and local/global aggregation frequencies.</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To enable model serving, the <em id="S3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">inference controller</em> is triggered at the end of the deployment phase to deploy and configure an inference service and an inference request agent per node.
In the context of hierarchical FL, an FL service can be a client that trains on local data or a server (aggregator) that provides model aggregation on a local or global level. The same model, updated during the learning process, can be used for inference. Therefore, on the same node, the orchestrator deploys an inference service, which is a server that provides an interface for interaction with the model. Also, each node hosts an inference routing agent, a proxy that decides where an inference request will be processed, implementing specific request routing logic. For example, if the node is under a heavy workload, such as when training a DL model, the routing agent forwards the requests to an inference service higher up in the hierarchy, i.e., the parent server (aggregator). Information on the load can be extracted from the GPO node controller.</p>

<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We should finally note that orchestration tasks involve deploying and managing services at runtime. Therefore, orchestration must adapt to environmental changes, such as node failures and network changes. The learning controller monitors the learning pipeline and reacts to these changes by performing re-clustering on environmental events. On the other hand, orchestration also needs to adapt to service-specific events. For example, in the continual learning settings our architecture targets, a task of the inference controller is to monitor inference services and trigger a new HFL task if inference accuracy is below a specific threshold.</p>

Federated learning clients continuously train models on their local data. After some time, they send their data to local servers that either aggregate the models and send them back to the clients or forward the aggregated models to the global server.
While some federated learning clients are training, some entities may send inference requests to the closest server, which is a federated learning client in most cases.
The inference request will be forwarded to the closest local server if the FL client is busy training.
If this server is busy, the request will be forwarded to the global server.</p>

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used for time-series predictions, and GRUs have gating mechanisms to improve the information flow. Therefore, they are often used in federated time-series prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
The GRU was trained for 20 epochs on 4 weeks of the data, and the remaining data was used for testing.
The best results were achieved using a batch size of 16, a hidden size of 128, 2 layers, and a learning rate of 0.0001.
After training for 100 epochs, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) predicting the test data was 0.04470, and the MSE of the retrained model that continuously retrained on new data was 0.04284.
These results demonstrate that continuously training the model decreased the MSE.</p>

For all settings, the model converges after about 20 aggregation rounds; for the non-hierarchical setup, this means that about 20 aggregation rounds with the cloud server are needed, whereas in the hierarchical setups, 20 aggregation rounds with the local servers were required and only 10 cloud aggregations.
The MSE slightly increases after around 50 aggregation rounds.
One reason for this increase may be the changing data.
However, after some time, the MSE decreases again, showing that there are some oscillations, but overall, the model indeed converges.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section compares the end-to-end latency when assuming different computing capacities on edge and cloud servers.
In the previous section, the assumption was made that the servers placed on edge nodes are as powerful as cloud servers.
Since this is often not the case, we compare the methods, considering a theoretical speedup of up to 95%.</p>

All edge hosts communicate with the global server at unit cost, and we force all clients to participate in training. Inference workloads and capacities are drawn uniformly at random. We compare the following three mechanisms: (i) vanilla FL, (ii) HFLOP, and (iii) the uncapacitated variant of HFLOP, where each edge host is assumed to have infinite request processing capacity.
The ML model under training is the one applied in our use case, whose size in serialized format is 594 KB. This is the payload uploaded/downloaded by an entity that submits a model update and receives a new model version. We configure HFL so that one global aggregation round takes place every two local ones; this is a rather conservative approach from a cost perspective, as it leads to a larger number of costly global aggregations. We compare the three approaches in terms of their communication cost <em id="S5.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">until convergence</em>, expressed as <em id="S5.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the volume of traffic exchanged over metered links</em>, i.e., excluding the traffic exchanged over zero-cost connections. In the experiments presented in Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-B2 Continuous federated learning ‣ V-B Continuous learning performance ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Inference Load-Aware Orchestration for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, convergence is ensured after approximately 100 aggregation rounds in all scenarios, which is what we also assume for this experiment. (If we assume convergence after 20 rounds instead, as discussed in Section <a href="#S5.SS2.SSS2" title="V-B2 Continuous federated learning ‣ V-B Continuous learning performance ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Inference Load-Aware Orchestration for Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span>2</span></a>, the results in absolute traffic volume terms we report below are scaled down accordingly.) Given our configuration, this corresponds to 50 global aggregation rounds for the hierarchical FL experiments. The uncapacitated HFLOP variant serves as the lower bound in terms of communication cost: since inference workloads of devices and the inference processing capacity of individual edge nodes are ignored, the derived solution is the best one could expect from a cost perspective.</p>

In more general settings (i.e., where devices and edge nodes have diverse communication costs and not unit ones), the cost gap between the two HFL variants is much more narrow.
Also, this cost gap gets narrower the more the overall available capacity; the capacity configurations we selected for this experiment favor the uncapacitated version of HFLOP.
Finally, in absolute traffic volume terms and for the clustered topology we experimented with in our use case (4 edge nodes, 20 devices), approximately 2.37 GB, 0.53 GB, and 0.24 GB was transmitted over metered links until GRU model training convergence using FL, HFLOP, and its uncapacitated version, respectively.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Variants of the orchestration problem.</span>
HFLOP can be extended in various ways to capture different operational requirements. Straightforward extensions include enforcing privacy-related constraints, where a device is allowed to associate only with edge nodes that it trusts, and considering device reliability in assignment decisions as long as such per-device information exists. These can be implemented with modified or additional HFLOP constraints. More importantly, current hierarchical federated learning designs often consider the effects of differences in client data distributions on learning performance, adding this dimension in their configuration decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Solving HFLOP while ensuring balanced data distributions among device clusters is an interesting and challenging problem.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Alternatives for inference serving.</span>
In our problem settings, we assume that a device that is busy training can offload all its inference workload to its associated edge node. Other inference-serving schemes, however, can be considered. For instance, trading inference quality for fast local execution, a device whose GPU is busy with an FL task can use a lower-complexity ML model for the same inference task suitable for CPU execution, such as a quantized version of the global model. Furthermore, more intelligent request routing strategies could be implemented at the device and the edge host (aggregator) end.</p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Dealing with environment dynamics.</span>
In practical FL settings, it is reasonable to expect that the device population fluctuates and that the conditions at edge nodes may change, e.g., in the presence of other application workloads that may affect the request processing capacity of edge nodes. Such changes may imply that a solution to HFLOP is not optimal anymore, and the question of what conditions should trigger its re-execution remains open. Adapting an HFL configuration in response to such changes requires considering reconfiguration costs and potentially applying heuristic schemes to deal with the complexity of HFLOP. This is the subject of our ongoing work on <em id="S6.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">adaptive FL orchestration</em>.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work addressed the challenge of inference serving during training in a federated learning environment. This challenge is particularly evident in continuous learning settings, where models must be retrained while serving inference requests. To this end, we introduced the inference-aware Hierarchical Federated Learning Orchestration Problem (HFLOP), which clusters federated learning clients considering their individual inference request workload and network costs, ensuring that inference requests are served as close to the clients as possible, lowering communication costs and response times.
Our systematic experiments show that our orchestration scheme decreases the communication cost without affecting the continuous training of the federated learning clients.
Our experiments also demonstrated significantly reduced end-to-end inference latency, achieving better results by processing inference requests on nearby edge servers. These performance benefits were sustained even for inference processing workloads that exceeded edge infrastructure capacity and in the presence of highly asymmetric compute resource capabilities between edge and cloud hosts.</p>
