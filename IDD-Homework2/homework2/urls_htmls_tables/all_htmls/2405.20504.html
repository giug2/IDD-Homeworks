<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Online learning has demonstrated notable potential to dynamically allocate limited resources to monitor a large population of processes, effectively balancing the exploitation of processes yielding high rewards, and the exploration of uncertain processes. However, most online learning algorithms were designed under 1) a centralized setting that requires data sharing across processes to obtain an accurate prediction or 2) a homogeneity assumption that estimates a single global model from the decentralized data. To facilitate the online learning of heterogeneous processes from the decentralized data, we propose a federated collaborative online monitoring method, which captures the latent representative models inherent in the population through representation learning and designs a novel federated collaborative UCB algorithm to estimate the representative models from sequentially observed decentralized data. The efficiency of our method is illustrated through theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and decentralized cognitive degradation monitoring in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Monitoring a large population of dynamic processes within the constraints of monitoring resources poses a significant challenge across various industrial sectors, including healthcare and engineering systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The complexity arises from two key factors: 1) the inherent disparity between the limited monitoring resources available and the large population of processes to be monitored, and 2) the uncertain and heterogeneous dynamics in the progression of these processes. In tackling this intricate problem, online learning from bandit feedback has demonstrated notable potential <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. These methods offer a solution by dynamically allocating limited resources, effectively balancing the exploitation of processes yielding high rewards and the exploration of uncertain processes. While existing online learning algorithms, including those cited above, show promise, they still exhibit certain limitations that hinder their effectiveness in addressing the complexities of monitoring under resource constraints.
The primary limitation of existing algorithms stems from their reliance on a centralized setting, necessitating the transmission of all data to a central server for model training. While this approach has demonstrated utility, it raises profound concerns about data privacy. In healthcare applications, such as patient health monitoring systems, this centralized model poses a substantial threat to data privacy, particularly with electronic health records (EHRs) containing sensitive patient information that ideally should remain within local organizations for privacy protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Beyond privacy, issues related to the costs of communication and data storage in a central server further underscore the imperative for a decentralized approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is crucial to develop decentralized algorithms that empower the storage and analysis of monitoring data at the local level, mitigating privacy risks and reducing communication and storage costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An ostensibly straightforward method to achieve decentralized monitoring is by modeling and monitoring the progression dynamic of each process independently using conventional online learning algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, this approach can be less effective due to the uneven data distribution among individual processes, where the disparity in available data for each process can lead to sub optimal model performance. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Given that each process features a heterogeneous dynamic that is not entirely independent, neglecting to exploit information sharing between processes may overlook opportunities to effectively span the model space for these processes’ models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Several federated online learning algorithms have been developed in the literature to learn a global model under distributed datasets online. A notable approach in this context is federated multi-armed bandits (FMAB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which provides a framework for units or processes to collaboratively solve a global bandit problem while retaining their information locally. In this approach, at each time step, each unit estimates the model locally and sends updates of model statistics to the central server. Subsequently, the central server sends back the aggregated statistics to enable each unit to enhance its model estimation for the next trial. This collaborative process allows the central server to develop a better selection strategy, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation. Nevertheless, these federated online learning algorithms usually focus on a homogeneous population that can be well described by a single global model. They can lead to a bias in estimating personalized models since the resulting global model only reflects the average effect, but fails to capture the between-unit variations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Some existing studies adopt a personalized modeling approach, such as the mixed model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which uses random effects to describe personalized variation. However, the mixed model used in these studies still cannot capture the underlying group structure in a heterogeneous population <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The underlying group structure represents diverse population characteristics where each group structure corresponds to one behavioral pattern or mechanism. Numerous studies have emphasized that capturing the underlying group structure could potentially enhance the accuracy of personalized modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address this problem, we consider the representation learning approach to exploit and monitor the hidden structure in a population. Representation learning is an approach that learns a representation to capture the common structure across different but related units <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. It offers substantial benefits in learning individualized models from insufficient monitoring data, especially at the beginning of the monitoring period.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no federated online learning algorithms that consider representation learning during unit modeling. The technical challenge is that achieving a good estimation of the latent group structure requires substantial communication between the central servers and units. Thus, a novel communication strategy is necessitated to balance the tradeoff between the algorithm performance (i.e., cumulative regret) and the communication cost. Additionally, existing federated online learning algorithms make decisions locally and independently for each unit. Instead, the online monitoring problem requires decision-making under global constraint, i.e., how to allocate limited monitoring resources, which differs from existing decentralized online learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate these gaps, we propose a federated collaborative online monitoring framework. The proposed framework aims to allocate limited monitoring resources to a heterogeneous population in real-time, using federated online representation learning. It consists of three main phases: the representation learning-based modeling, the decentralized parameter estimation and communication, and the monitoring strategy design. In the first phase, we leverage a representation learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> approach to model the heterogeneous population, which assumes the existence of a shared representation that captures the underlying group structure among units. The second phase introduces a novel federated collaborative online monitoring (FCOM) algorithm to estimate the shared representation from distributed and sequentially arrived data. In the third phase, a novel upper confidence bound (UCB)-based score is developed to real-time assess the uncertainty of model estimation from the FCOM algorithm and inform the optimal monitoring resource allocation that balances the exploitation of high-reward units and exploration of uncertain ones. We rigorously prove sublinear regret and communication cost upper bounds of the proposed FCOM algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed method is validated by a simulation study and an empirical study on online cognitive degradation monitoring for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Online monitoring can be formulated as a sequential decision-making problem where the decision of which units need to be monitored is made in each trial/cycle. Due to the unknown dynamics in process progression, reinforcement learning methods have been recently used to solve the online monitoring problem. The selective sensing method developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>
incorporates Markov process and representation learning to model personalized process progression for a population of units and builds an optimization model to allocate resources to units that provide the highest monitoring rewards. However, it cannot balance the exploitation-exploration trade-off in resource allocation since it does not consider the uncertainty in model estimation. The collaborative learning-based UCB (CLUCB) algorithm introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> mitigates this limitation by designing a novel UCB-based exploration method to assess model estimation uncertainty and find an optimal monitoring strategy under the exploitation-exploration trade-off. However, these methods, as mentioned earlier, consider the online monitoring problem in a centralized setting, meaning all units’ observations of reward and historical data are shared and exposed in the central server, which may lead to the risk of privacy leakage and high computational costs.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated online learning, each unit collects the observations sequentially instead of observing the whole training data at once, updates the local model, and transmits its local updates to the central server when new observations are available, which broadcasts a global aggregated model to all units at the end of the time step <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the unit estimates an individualized model based on its neighbor-units’ models in which their learned aggregation weights are updated at each time step. Since it only exploits the information from neighboring units, it does not reflect insights about the population group structure, which requires the units to learn across groups. The federated multi-armed bandit (FMAB) is designed under a decentralized setting to preserve data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, to address data privacy concerns between units and the central server, the monitoring system aims to ensure that historical information, including the unit’s observed feature vectors and rewards, remains confidential and distributed within each unit and is not exposed to the central server or other units. The online monitoring problem is further complicated under distributed data due to the need for efficient communication between local units and the central server and the increased uncertainty in model estimation. To solve this problem, this paper presents a federated collaborative online monitoring approach that integrates representation learning and a federated online learning algorithm.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p4.4" class="ltx_p">However, these federated learning algorithms solve the representation learning problem in the offline setting, which is inappropriate for online monitoring where the models need to be updated with sequentially arrived data and the decisions need to be made under the exploitation-exploration trade-off. Thus, we propose a novel federated collaborative online monitoring algorithm to solve this issue in the next section.

This prediction reflects the model’s current best knowledge about the underlying group structure among all units and serves for exploitation purposes. Moreover, collecting only predicted rewards does not guarantee optimal selection, as it neglects prediction uncertainty estimated by each local unit. To address this issue, the upper confidence bound (UCB) principle is commonly used, which comprises two main components: the unit’s predicted reward and the unit’s prediction uncertainty <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. This score balances the objective of selecting units with the highest rewards (exploitation) and units with high uncertainty in reward predictions (exploration). This will allow the uncertain units to be explored to gain more information and confidence in selection. To obtain the UCB score, we need to derive the uncertainty of parameters estimated from the distributed data using the algorithm in Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS2" title="III-B2 FCOM algorithm ‣ III-B Federated Collaborative Online Monitoring ‣ III method ‣ FCOM: A Federated Collaborative Online Monitoring Framework via Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span>2</span></a>.</p>

LinUCB estimates the coefficients of units’ reward functions independently through L2-regularized least square estimation. The Sync-LinUCB models personalized reward functions using a federated mixed model. Specifically, the random effects are estimated within local units independently whereas the fixed effect is estimated in the central server globally. However, neither algorithm exploits the representation learning approach to extract the latent patterns presented in the unit’s reward function. CLUCB considers the online modeling and monitoring of units’ reward functions via representation learning. However, it is developed for the centralized setting, meaning it shares and saves all units’ observations of reward and feature vectors in the central server. The cumulative regret defined in Equation <a href="#S3.E2" title="In III-A Problem Statement ‣ III method ‣ FCOM: A Federated Collaborative Online Monitoring Framework via Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> is used to compare the performance of all algorithms in both simulation and real-world studies. The communication cost is also compared to illustrate the effectiveness of implementing a federated learning approach to solve the monitoring problem.</p>

The representative models are randomly generated from the multivariate normal distribution. To ensure each unit’s reward function can be effectively resembled by one of the representative models, its membership vector is randomly generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Specifically, the Gaussian distributions have zero-mean components, and the respective prior probabilities are estimated from the real data.:</p>

Sync-LinUCB exhibits lower cumulative regret than LinUCB in both scenarios but it has high variations in the high-constraint scenario.
Our proposed FCOM algorithm achieves a lower cumulative regret than LinUCB and Sync-LinUCB, despite having slightly higher communication costs than Sync-LinUCB as depicted in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-C Regret Analysis ‣ III method ‣ FCOM: A Federated Collaborative Online Monitoring Framework via Representation Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> c) and d). This aligns with the theoretical analysis outlined in the previous section. The results indicate that incorporating the shared representation and providing information about the group structure among units, leads to the most significant performance improvement. Moreover, compared to CLUCB which is in a centralized setting, the cumulative regret of FCOM is slightly higher. This suggests modeling the dynamic health progression in a federated learning setting to preserve data privacy does not hurt the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A case study of applying the proposed method to online monitor the cognitive degradation in older adults is further conducted. Monitoring the cognitive degradation in older adults is critical for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The monitoring reward is defined as the cognitive status measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> in each cycle. The MMSE score is based on the severity of degradation which is categorized into three states including healthy state (27-30), mild cognitive impairment (24-26), and dementia (0-23) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. A more severe cognitive status corresponds to a higher monitoring reward as it can lead to the early prevention and treatment of AD. Due to the limited monitoring resources in clinical practice, the objective of this case study is to apply the proposed method to maximally monitor older adults with severe cognitive status under limited resources. To apply the proposed method, we model the progression of MMSE by the commonly used degradation model that uses time and its polynomial basis functions
as predictors in which the cognitive degradation process of the patient <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="i" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑖</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">i</annotation></semantics></math> is formulated as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>:</p>

LinUCB and Sync-LinUCB exhibit higher cumulative regret than the proposed FCOM in both scenarios. The cumulative regret of Sync-LinUCB reaches convergence only in the high-constraint scenario, while our proposed algorithm converges and outperforms Sync-LinUCB in both scenarios. This observation suggests that effectively leveraging representation learning improves the accuracy of cognitive degradation modeling in AD and enables more accurate monitoring resource allocation. Moreover, it indicates the stability of the proposed algorithm regardless of the number of selected older adults. Moreover, similar to the simulation studies, the cumulative regret of the proposed FCOM is slightly higher than CLUCB, suggesting that modeling older adults’ cognitive degradation in a decentralized setting to preserve data privacy does not hurt the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel Federated Online Collaborative Monitoring (FCOM) algorithm designed to enable decentralized online learning of a population comprising latent structured units. The proposed FCOM algorithm leverages representation learning to capture the latent group structure and estimates the latent group structure from distributed and sequentially observed data by real-time updating the local statistics and communicating these statistics between the central server and local units. A novel UCB score is further developed to inform the optimal monitoring resource allocation. Through regret analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm yields a reduced upper regret bound compared to the benchmark models when the latent group structure is low-rank. Simulation studies and an empirical study of online cognitive monitoring in Alzheimer’s disease further validate that the proposed algorithm achieves lower cumulative regret compared to other benchmark models. In the future, we will extend the proposed FCOM algorithm to an asynchronous setting where not all units are available at the beginning of the trial. Moreover, we would like to develop more efficient communication by minimizing the size of statistics to eliminate the necessity of incurring a higher communication cost while still achieving a lower regret bound. Lastly, we will integrate shared similarity information between units to facilitate the inductive transfer of knowledge and preserve privacy.</p>
