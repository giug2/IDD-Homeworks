<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an attractive paradigm for making use of rich distributed data while protecting data privacy. Nonetheless, nonideal communication links and limited transmission resources may hinder the implementation of fast and accurate FL. In this paper, we study joint optimization of communications and FL based on analog aggregation transmission in realistic wireless networks. We first derive closed-form expressions for the expected convergence rate of FL over the air, which theoretically quantify the impact of analog aggregation on FL. Based on the analytical results, we develop a joint optimization model for accurate FL implementation, which allows a parameter server to select a subset of workers and determine an appropriate power scaling factor. Since the practical setting of FL over the air encounters unobservable parameters, we reformulate the joint optimization of worker selection and power allocation using controlled approximation.
Finally, we efficiently solve the resulting mixed-integer programming problem via a simple yet optimal finite-set search method by reducing the search space. Simulation results show that the proposed solutions developed for realistic wireless analog channels outperform a benchmark method, and achieve comparable performance of the ideal case where FL is implemented over noise-free wireless channels.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, with the development of IoT and social networks, huge amounts of data have been generated at the edge of networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. To obtain useful information from big data, machine learning has been widely applied to deal with complex models and tasks in emerging data-driven applications, such as autonomous driving, virtual and augmented reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Standard machine learning is usually developed under a centralized architecture, where each node located at the edge sends its collected data to a central node for centralized data processing.
However, with the exponential growth of the volume of local data and the increasing concerns on user data privacy, it is neither practical nor safe to directly transmit the data of local devices to a central node due to the limited communication and processing capability as well as the lack of privacy protection. As such, distributed machine learning is well motivated to overcome these issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the regime of distributed machine learning, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a well noted approach for collaborative learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In FL, local workers train local models from their own data, and then transmit their local updates to a parameter server (PS). The PS aggregates these received local updates and sends the averaged update back to the local workers.These iterative updates between the PS and workers, can be either model parameters or their gradients, for model averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and gradient averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, respectively.
In this way, FL relieves communication overheads and protects user privacy compared to traditional data-sharing based collaborative learning, especially when the local data is in large volume and privacy-sensitive. Existing research on FL mostly focuses on FL algorithms under idealized link assumptions. However, the impacts of wireless environments on FL performance should be taken into account in the design of FL deployed in practical wireless systems. Otherwise, such impacts may introduce unwanted training errors that dramatically degrade the learning performance in terms of accuracy and convergence rate<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To solve this problem, research efforts have been spent on optimizing network resources used for transmitting model updates in FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. These works of FL over wireless networks adopt digital communications, using a transmission-then-aggregation policy. Unfortunately, the communication overhead and transmission latency become large as the number of active workers increases. On the other hand, it is worth noting that FL aims for global aggregation and hence only utilizes the averaged updates of distributed workers rather than the individual local updates from workers. Alternatively, the nature of waveform superposition in wireless multiple access channel (MAC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> provides a direct and efficient way for transmission of the averaged updates in FL, also known as analog aggregation based FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. As a joint transmission-and-aggregation policy, analog aggregation transmission enables all the participating workers to simultaneously upload their local model updates to the PS over the same time-frequency resources as long as the aggregated waveform represents the averaged updates, thus substantially reducing the overhead of wireless communication for FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The research on analog aggregation based FL is still at early stage, leaving some fundamental questions unexplored, such as its convergence behavior and design of efficient algorithms. Given the limited transmit power and communication bandwidth at user devices, users may have to contend for communication resources when transmitting their local updates to the PS. It gives rise to the need for an efficient transmission paradigm, along with network resource allocation in terms of worker selection and transmit power control. All these practical issues motivate our work to study FL from the perspectives of both wireless communications and machine learning. In this paper, we quantify the impact of analog aggregation on the convergence behavior and performance of FL. Such quantitative results are essential in guiding the joint optimization of communication and computing resources. This paper aims at a comprehensive study on problem formulation, solution development, and algorithm implementation for the joint design and optimization of wireless communication and FL. Our key contributions are summarized as follows:</p>

These closed-form expressions unveil a fundamental connection between analog wireless communication and FL with analog aggregation, which provides a fresh perspective to measure how the parameter design of analog wireless systems affects the performance of FL over the air.</p>

</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve communication efficiency in distributed learning, most of the existing strategies focus on digital communications, which may involve the preprocessing of transmitted updates or the management of wireless resources. For example, a popular line of work is to reduce the communication load per worker by compression of the updates under the assumptions of ideal communication links, such as exploiting coding schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, utilizing the sparsity of updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, employing quantization of the updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and avoiding less informative local updates via communication censoring schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Another line of work is to support FL through communication resource management, such as worker scheduling schemes to maximize the number of participating workers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, joint optimization of resource allocation and worker scheduling<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and communication and computation resource allocation and scheduling for cell-free networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are some pioneering works on analog aggregation based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, most of which focus on designing transmission schemes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. They adopt preselected participating workers and fix their power allocation without further optimization along FL iterations. The optimization issues are considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, but they are mainly conducted on the communication side alone, without an underlying connection to FL. When communication-based metrics are used, the optimization in existing works often suggests to maximize the number of selected workers that participate FL, but our theoretical results indicate that selecting more workers is not necessarily better over imperfect links or under limited communication resources. Thus, unlike these existing works, we seek to analyze the convergence behavior of analog aggregation based FL, which provides a fresh angle to interpret the specific relationship between communications and FL in the paradigm of analog aggregation. Such a connection leads to this work on a joint optimization framework for analog communications and FL, in which the work selection and power allocation decisions are optimized during the iterative FL process.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first formulate a joint optimization problem to reduce the gap for FL over the air, which turns out to be applicable for both the convex and non-convex cases, using either GD or SGD implementations. To make it applicable in practice in the presence of some unobservable parameters at the PS, we reformulate it to an approximate problem by imposing a conservative power constraint. To efficiently solve such an approximate problem, we first identify a tight solution space and then develop an optimal solution via discrete programming.</p>

Thus, its performance is worst. Our proposed INFLOTA performs closely to the ideal case, which jointly considers the learning and the influence of wireless communication. This is because that our proposed INFLOTA can optimize worker selection and power control so as to reduce the effect of wireless transmission errors on FL.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied the joint optimization of communications and
FL over the air with analog aggregation, in which both worker selection and transmit power control are considered under the constraints of limited communication resources. Under the convex and non-convex cases with either the GD or SGD implementations, we respectively derive closed-form expressions for the expected convergence rate of the FL algorithm, which can quantify the impact of resource-constrained wireless communications on FL under the analog aggregation paradigm. Through analyzing the expected convergence rate, we have proposed a joint optimization scheme of worker selection and power control, which can mitigate the impact of wireless communications on the convergence and performance of the FL algorithm. More significantly, our joint optimization scheme is applicable for both the convex and non-convex cases, using either GD or SGD implementations. Simulation results show that the proposed optimization scheme is effective in mitigating the impact of wireless communications on FL.</p>
