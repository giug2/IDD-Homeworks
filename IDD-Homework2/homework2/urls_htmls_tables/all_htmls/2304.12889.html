<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) framework with Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX)-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to securely aggregate local models in Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoTs). In FL, local models can be tampered with by attackers. Hence, a global model generated from the tampered local models can be erroneous. Therefore, the proposed framework leverages a blockchain network for secure model aggregation. Each blockchain node hosts an SGX-enabled processor that securely performs the FL-based aggregation tasks to generate a global model. Blockchain nodes can verify the authenticity of the aggregated model, run a blockchain consensus mechanism to ensure the integrity of the model, and add it to the distributed ledger for tamper-proof storage. Each cluster can obtain the aggregated model from the blockchain and verify its integrity before using it. We conducted several experiments with different CNN models and datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Internet-of-Things (IoT) explosion has made it an integral component of various intelligent applications. Intelligent applications include but are not limited to healthcare, manufacturing, critical system infrastructure, agriculture, and transportation. IoT devices enable the collection of a large volume of data and act autonomously in an intelligent system, thanks to machine learning algorithms. The large volume of IoT data plays an essential role in training a machine learning algorithm system. In general, IoT devices are resource-constrained and cannot execute machine learning algorithms independently. Edge computing technology is gaining acceptance at a tremendous rate to form intelligent networks in conjunction with IoT and machine learning. An edge device (referred to as an edge server throughout the article) and IoT devices within the network form a cluster. In an intelligent system, edge devices can host a machine learning algorithm that uses a locally-built dataset and produce a trained model. IoT devices generate data and receive control instructions depending on the type of IoT device. Later, the trained model can be used to make an intelligent decision in the system.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although an edge and IoT-based system configuration with
machine learning capability can manage different system tasks automatically, the level of accuracy impedes its success. For example, a trained model produced by an edge server with local data might not consider many features that could be absent in the local dataset. The accuracy can be improved if the edge device can collaborate with other edge servers that have produced their trained model based on their local datasets. This learning method is called <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Distributed Collaborative Machine Learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.p2.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a><span id="S1.p2.1.1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span>. Traditional distributed collaborative machine learning (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation in Trusted Execution Environment for Internet-of-Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) allows different clusters to send their locally-trained model and datasets to a centralized server, such as the cloud. Cloud aggregates all locally-trained models using datasets from different sources and produces an aggregated trained model shared with all clusters to improve decision-making accuracy.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a complete framework for FL that simultaneously safeguards the privacy of IoT data and ensures security during the generation of aggregated trained models. In addition, the proposed framework guarantees trustworthy storage and sharing of the outcomes of any training. The proposed framework comprises a Convolutional Neural FL architecture that combines an Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX)-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and blockchain platform. We assume that multiple IoT and edge devices clusters produce locally-trained models based on their local dataset and send the local model to the blockchain network for aggregation. In this framework, each blockchain node hosts an SGX-enabled processor that individually performs the FL- based aggregation tasks to generate an aggregated model. Once SGX-enabled processors of blockchain nodes perform the aggregation, each node can verify the authenticity of the aggregated model, run a blockchain consensus mechanism to ensure the integrity of the model, and add it to a blockchain for tamper-proof storage. An edge server from each cluster can collect the latest aggregated model from the blockchain and verify its integrity before using it. The key contributions of our work are summarized below.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate and discuss the problem that exists with traditional collaborative machine learning, we use an IoT-enabled smart warehouse scenario (see Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Problem Scenario ‣ Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation in Trusted Execution Environment for Internet-of-Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). Assume that several smart warehouses are geographically dispersed. Each warehouse receives multiple pre-packed boxes of various garments (for both men and women), including shirts, trousers, shoes, jackets, and bags for storage. Each warehouse uses machine learning and an IoT-enabled camera to automatically sort the boxes according to the type of garment they contain. The camera scans the generic photo of the garment, which is shown on the box. However, IoT-enabled cameras are resourced-constrained and cannot execute the machine learning algorithm. Hence, each warehouse is equipped with an edge server with access to the local dataset and hosts the machine learning algorithm to train a model for recognizing garment items based on the local dataset. Nevertheless, the accuracy of a training model derived from the local dataset may not be good. Therefore, the edge server of each warehouse participates in a cloud-based collaborative machine learning platform to share its local dataset and the trained model. The cloud-based collaborative machine learning platform produces an aggregated model based on the received local datasets and models. The aggregated model is sent to all edge servers to achieve higher accuracy in recognizing the garment items.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the aforementioned collaborative learning scenario improves overall accuracy, it suffers from the following security risks:</p>

Sending local datasets to the cloud introduces the risk of a privacy breach. For example, a dishonest employee from the cloud service provider can act as an <span id="S2.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">internal attacker</span> and collect the warehouse’s sensitive product information and share it with a business competitor for financial gain. Hence, there is the need for an aggregation model that would not require local datasets to generate an aggregated model.</p>

The aggregated model produced by a cloud service provider can be biased, as a cloud-based platform cannot be trusted. For instance, an internal attacker can generate a biased aggregated model not using the given local models or inject a faulty trained model to interrupt the generation of aggregated models. Therefore, a secure environment is required to prevent biased model generation.</p>

In the traditional cloud-based collaborative learning environment, an internal attacker of the cloud platform can interfere with disseminating the aggregated model. For example, an attacker can alter some part of the aggregated model before the cloud sends it to the edge servers. The traditional method does not allow a receiver of the aggregated model (i.e., edge server) to verify its integrity before using it. Hence, a trustworthy platform is required for sharing the aggregated model with edge servers.</p>

Several works on privacy-preserving federated learning have been presented recently.

Wei <span id="S3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and Zhao <span id="S3.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a framework where data privacy is improved by means of differential privacy. However, the use of DP will slow down the training process and reduce accuracy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> the author proposes anonymous federated learning by adding a proxy layer and DP to the data. However, the proxy layer will add communication overhead, and the result shows that the DP decreases the ML accuracy. Li <span id="S3.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> leverage SMPC-based federated learning to secure aggregation. Hence, their framework relies on a centralized server to arrange the secret sharing. This could be a problem since all the models can be seen in plaintext after the cloud collects the secret share. Federated learning is delicate to an attacker that can launch backdoor attacks. Bagdasaryan <span id="S3.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> found that a backdoor can compromise the federated learning and poison the machine learning model.

Blockchain was first launched as a cryptocurrency technology. However, it has now been expanded for data storage across multiple computational nodes in a distributed fashion. Blockchain is structured as a linked list of blocks holding a set of transactions. Ali <span id="S3.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a method to ensure the privacy and security of healthcare systems using blockchain. Their approach focuses mainly on securing patient data from active collision attacks by leveraging novel smart contracts and encryption algorithms. Nowadays, many studies are incorporating blockchain into their federated learning methodologies because federated learning is based on a centralized server, which is vulnerable to attack. Zhao <span id="S3.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> designed a system where each of the clients will sign the model after the training process and send it to the blockchain. However, if this model has many clients, the computation cost will be very high. In recent works, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed a framework where the model is stored in the blockchain node, and federated learning is performed. However, in their architecture, the model is not totally encrypted. Also, the aggregation is performed by an untrusted party.

The disadvantage of this method is that the edge devices will require a lot of computation power. The author in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposes a blockchain architecture to collect the locally-trained model weights collaboratively from different sources for healthcare scenarios. However, the local model that is stored in the blockchain is not protected by any privacy measure. In this case, other parties can see the model, thereby raising privacy issues.</p>

Their proposed framework protects the local model training with differential privacy (DP). The central server aggregates the global model and stores it in the blockchain. However, the global model accuracy is lower than the locally trained model. The use of DP in this framework can preserve privacy while sacrificing accuracy.

Their proposed architectures leverage drones as an edge intelligence to perform the aggregation in FL. The aggregation process on a drone is vulnerable to tampering attacks and poisoning attacks. Since drones are deployed on the field and open networks, hardware security such as TEE can secure the aggregation process.</p>

As shown in the table, existing works are mostly unsecured, inefficient, and have low accuracy. Hence, we deploy the blockchain on the server-side to reduce training model storage costs and leverage TEE to ensure secure and trustworthy model aggregation before sending it to the blockchain.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the experiments, we selected three datasets popularly used for the machine learning process: Fashion MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, and MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. These datasets are commonly used for benchmarking in the machine learning framework. Therefore, we have used them to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach. The dataset is used to train and test the local model on the client-side in the proposed FL-based approach. For all our experiments, we split the training and testing sets. Based on the number of participants, we evenly distribute the training and test sets among all participants. Fashion MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> is a collection of datasets containing fashion images. The training set comprised 60,000, and 10,000 images were used as a test set. Each image had a 28×28-pixel grayscale, and nine different classes were represented (trousers, dress, bag, etc.). MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> is a dataset consisting of handwritten digits (60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 in the test set). Each image is a 28×28-pixel image of a handwritten digit. CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> consists of 50,000 images in the training set and 10,000 in the test set. It comprises 10 different classes (such as cars, dogs, planes), and there are 6,000 images in each class, where each image contains 32×32-colored pixels.

<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We consider three models for our experiment. First, the LeNet model was used, which was proposed by LeCun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The model contains two convolutional layers and two fully-connected layers. This model is suitable for running experiments using the Fashion MNIST and MNIST datasets. Second, the AlexNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> model is used with five convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers. This model can use batch normalization layers for stability and efficient training. AlexNet is suitable for testing on the CIFAR-10 datasets. Finally, the VGG16 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> model is used that has 16 layers and about 138 million parameters.

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">First, we evaluate the performance of our framework for the global model aggregation process(see Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-C Experimental Results and Performance Evaluation ‣ V Results and Discussion ‣ Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation in Trusted Execution Environment for Internet-of-Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>). This experiment shows the time cost difference when performing the secure aggregation process with enclaves and without enclaves with various numbers of edge devices ranging from 2 to 40. Results show the aggregation times required by LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG16 for a batch size of 128. In Fig. <a href="#S5.F9.sf1" title="In Figure 9 ‣ V-C Experimental Results and Performance Evaluation ‣ V Results and Discussion ‣ Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation in Trusted Execution Environment for Internet-of-Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(a)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F9.sf4" title="In Figure 9 ‣ V-C Experimental Results and Performance Evaluation ‣ V Results and Discussion ‣ Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation in Trusted Execution Environment for Internet-of-Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(d)</span></a>, we show the LeNet model with Fashion MNIST and MNIST dataset, respectively. The experimental results show that the LeNet model exhibits a similar trend when used on Fashion MNIST and MNIST datasets. The time is consistently stable when it has 20 edge devices, and the time cost rises a little bit when it reaches 30 edge devices during the aggregation in the TEE. The average additional time cost is 1.2 seconds. Figures <a href="#S5.F9.sf2" title="In Figure 9 ‣ V-C Experimental Results and Performance Evaluation ‣ V Results and Discussion ‣ Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation in Trusted Execution Environment for Internet-of-Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(b)</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F9.sf3" title="In Figure 9 ‣ V-C Experimental Results and Performance Evaluation ‣ V Results and Discussion ‣ Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation in Trusted Execution Environment for Internet-of-Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(c)</span></a> show the results of AlexNet and VGG-16 models with CIFAR-10 dataset. When we perform the VGG-16 model with 40 edge devices, the aggregation process without SGX requires 19.1 seconds. The aggregation process is higher with SGX, which is 21.8 seconds. The required time to aggregate local training models of VGG-16 is the highest due to the involvement of 16 layers. Nevertheless, it is only 2.7 seconds slower than the time cost of aggregation without SGX.

The time cost is 1.1 seconds for batch size is 1 and 2.2 seconds for batch size 16. The time costs increase slightly, keeping the same linear characteristics when the experiments are performed inside the enclave with the same settings. The LeNet model requires 8.1 seconds to 9.4 seconds, while VGG-16 requires 1.5 seconds to 2.9 seconds. The experiment results show that the time cost increases for both inside and outside enclave training when all the machine learning models use 20 batch sizes. The time costs also increase if the number of images in a batch increases.</p>

In this experiment, we performed multiple federated learning processes that use normal aggregation and SGX-based secure aggregation. We used pre-processed the Fashion MNIST dataset and the LeNet machine learning model with 128 batch sizes for the experiment. We consider different number of edge servers ranging from 2 to 40. Results indicate that the time cost increases gradually for the federated learning process with and without SGX-based aggregation. When comparing the results of normal CPU and SGX based approach, the time differs about 70 milliseconds with 10 edge servers and 91 milliseconds with 40 edge servers.</p>

In this experiment, the TEE aggregates all the models from the edge server to form a global model. The global model is then verified and deployed in the blockchain network. Our simulation tested the performance using several blockchain nodes ranging from 5 to 20. The deployment phase requires roughly 100 milliseconds (with 5 blockchain nodes) to 230 milliseconds (with 20 blockchain nodes). The verification phase is faster than the deployment phase and requires 60 milliseconds and 180 milliseconds with 5 and 20 blockchain nodes, respectively. The processing times of both phases increase linearly with the increment of blockchain nodes.</p>

Federated learning allows computational parties to collaboratively learn a shared model while preserving all training data locally, separating the machine learning process from the storage of data in the central server. The method is unlike traditional centralized machine learning where local datasets are stored in one central server. Therefore, federated learning can ensure the privacy of the client’s sensitive data.</p>

In our framework, the local training model is encrypted using a shared key before it is sent to the blockchain node. The shared key is established using a secure key-exchange protocol. Later, the local training model will be decrypted inside the enclave for secure aggregation. As the local model is encrypted, model inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, and parameter stealing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> cannot be performed on a local model by an adversary.</p>

In federated learning, aggregation is typically performed on a normal server. Several researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> have proposed a differential privacy (DP) method to secure the model during the aggregation process. However, DP will significantly reduce the accuracy of the global model.

As the aggregation is performed in the TEE, adversaries cannot tamper with or steal the model parameters during the aggregation process. As blockchain technology is being used with emerging technologies, such as drones<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, the proposed blockchain and TEE-based model aggregation in FL would enhance the trust in applications where drones are used as edge intelligence in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

Blockchain is a decentralized technology that can maintain data integrity by means of an extensive network that can withstand security breaches from untrusted parties. In the proposed framework, we use blockchain to store the global model after the aggregation process in the TEE. This decentralization makes it almost impossible for an adversary to compromise the network. Moreover, model updates are protected by digital signatures and hashes. Hence, the adversary cannot tamper with or contaminate the global model since this will change the hash value.</p>

Although our proposed method can ensure the privacy of the model and the security of the aggregation process, performance is still a crucial metric for measuring the quality of the framework. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed framework is better than that of the baseline model. Our proposed framework is different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> where the whole training process occurs inside the enclave for a single deep-learning model. On the other hand, our framework uses a federated learning setup, and only the aggregation is performed inside the enclave. We also examine the reduction of our model’s accuracy when we leverage TEE. Our proposed method has only up to 3% accuracy reduction compared to Myelin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and Chiron <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> that have more than 5% and 7% accuracy reduction, respectively. In other words, our proposed framework achieves a good balance between privacy and model performance.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a blockchain and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) enabled Federated Learning (FL) framework is proposed for IoT. The main objective of this framework is to ensure the trustworthy aggregation of local models to obtain a global model. The aggregation is done within the blockchain network. The proposed framework leverages the Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX)-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to ensure secure aggregation where each blockchain node executes the aggregation task. In this framework, each blockchain node is equipped with an SGX-enabled processor that securely generates a global model to ensure trustworthiness. Later, the global model is verified by the blockchain network via a consensus mechanism before it is added to the blockchain, thereby maintaining tamperproof storage. Users of the global model can access it and verify its integrity only through the blockchain network. We use different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithms with several benchmark datasets to generate local models and aggregate them under FL settings. We conducted several experiments that show that our proposed framework’s processing time is almost similar to that of the original FL model. In addition, our framework has only around 2% less accuracy compared to the original FL model. It is essential to mention that this framework has leveraged a hash-based consensus mechanism to ensure the model’s integrity. In the future, we intend to develop an efficient consensus mechanism for the proposed TEE and blockchain-based FL framework in order to make it more practical. In this paper, we assume that all participants perform homogeneous tasks and use same approach to generate their respective local models. Each participant uses their own private dataset and the federated learning architecture to obtain a global model. However, we plan to extend our current work in the future to support heterogeneous tasks in Blockchain-based federated learning with TEE based secure aggregation.</p>
