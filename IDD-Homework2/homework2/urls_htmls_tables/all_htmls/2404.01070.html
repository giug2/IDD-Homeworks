<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id5.id1">This paper addresses the ethical challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, emphasizing the imperative for developers to ensure fairness and cultural sensitivity. We investigate the ethical competence of AI models in NMT, examining the
Ethical considerations at each stage of NMT development including data handling, privacy, data ownership, and consent. We identify and address ethical issues through empirical studies. These include employing Transformer models for Luganda-English translations and enhancing efficiency with sentence mini-batching. And complementary studies that refine data labeling techniques and fine-tune BERT and Longformer models for analyzing Luganda and English social media content. Our second approach is a literature review from databases such as Google Scholar and platforms like GitHub. Additionally, the paper probes the distribution of responsibility between AI systems and humans, underscoring the essential role of human oversight in upholding NMT ethical standards. Incorporating a biblical perspective, we discuss the societal impact of NMT and the broader ethical responsibilities of developers, positing them as stewards accountable for the societal repercussions of their creations.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Ethics, as an academic discipline, refers to the systematic inquiry and practical application of principles and values that serve as guiding frameworks for shaping human behavior and facilitating decision-making in matters of morality<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>. It can be looked at in various perspectives and categories; Environment ethics, research ethics, ethics design methods that looks at human computer interaction, design research, professional ethics, medicine, and business, conflict of interest that focuses on the ability to distinguish between interest and moral ground, etc. The concept and perception can also vary according to cultures due to the various norms, definition of values, and beliefs. Ethics is crucial in multicultural societies to help in 1) promoting understanding and reducing conflict, 2) enhancing communication and cooperation, 3) addressing ethical dilemmas to enable diversity at workplaces, 4) maintaining social order, respect, and cohesion through guiding policy and practices<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite>.</p>

Addressing these concerns goes beyond academic inquiry, recognizing that the decisions made in developing and deploying NMT systems carry significant consequences. This necessitates exploring the ethical capacity of AI-driven translation models and the moral responsibility attributed to their creators and operators. Incorporating a biblical perspective, we approach these modern ethical challenges with an understanding that echoes timeless virtues, such as wisdom, integrity, and the pursuit of communal well-being, akin to the ethical teachings in the bible. This cross-disciplinary approach enriches the ethical discourse in AI, bridging the gap between rapid technological advancement and the need for conscientious stewardship over our creations. Therefore, this paper frames pressing questions within this broader ethical context: Can AI systems reflect the ethical deliberation akin to these virtues in their functionality, and how do we assign responsibility for their actions? These queries become increasingly critical as autonomous decision-making systems gain prevalence.
The paper is positioned within this framework, converging on the objective to scrutinize ethical considerations pertinent to NMT. We endeavor to reveal the ethical implications at every development stage of these translation systems and propose guiding principles that balance technical progress with ethical accountability. Through this inquiry, we aim to foster the advancement of NMT technologies that honor the diversity of human languages and cultures, promoting justice and equity for communities of all linguistic resources.</p>

This again shifts the focus to human decisions made during the model’s development phase. Thus, even though the machine executes the translation, the ethical responsibility for its output arguably lies more with the humans who develop, train, and deploy the NMT system.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.p4.1">This perspective suggests that while machines can ”make decisions” based on their programming, the ultimate ethical accountability rests with the humans who create and manage these systems. Therefore, in the context of NMT, any ethical blame for translation errors or biases should be directed more towards the developers rather than the machine itself, emphasizing the need for responsible AI development practices.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS4.p2.1">The fundamental difference between neural networks and human moral decision-making lies in consciousness and intent. Humans make ethical decisions based on a complex interplay of consciousness, cultural background, personal experiences, and moral education. Neural networks, on the other hand, rely solely on mathematical functions, learned patterns, and the data they have been trained on. They lack the ability to consciously reflect or understand the moral weight of their ”decisions”.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">In this exploration, the authors navigate the ethical landscape within a technical context, addressing significant issues and proposing targeted solutions. However, this inquiry presents only a segment of the wider academic journey. Extending this exploration reveals the profound impact of ethical standards on one’s professional pathway, especially within the mentor-student dynamic integral to academia’s educational, research, and teaching frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib47" title="">47</a>]</cite>. Incorporating a spiritual dimension offers a fuller perspective. For instance, the encouragement found in ”Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men” (Colossians 3:23-24) can motivate developers to pursue excellence and maintain the highest professional standards. Similarly, ”Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men” (Proverbs 22:29) recognizes the importance of skill and diligence in career progression. Moreover, the emphasis on integrity and honesty as essential for ethical conduct is captured in ”The integrity of the upright guides them” (Proverbs 11:3), while the value of diligence as a key to success is articulated in ”The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied” (Proverbs 13:4). These Biblical passages underline the significance of a solid ethical foundation in academic and professional endeavors, highlighting virtues such as integrity, excellence, and diligence as critical for shaping one’s professional identity and practices<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib47" title="">47</a>]</cite>. Embracing these values during graduate education is vital for career development and professional achievement, illustrating the profound relevance of our research to the academic community.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p2.1">Academia’s ’publish or perish’ ethos, often pressures academicians to sideline ethical norms in their quest to feature in high-impact journals. To counter this, the development of forums and training programs is imperative, not only to enhance ethical understanding among academicians but also to foster a culture of continuous professional growth and knowledge exchange <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib48" title="">48</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p3.1">The exploration of ethical concerns and proposed solutions in the context of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) development underscores the crucial role of self-education for developers. This is paralleled by the Biblical emphasis on the pursuit of wisdom and understanding, as encapsulated in Proverbs 4:7: ”Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.” Developers are urged to diligently understand website policies, rules, and guidelines, mirroring the Biblical exhortation to seek knowledge and advice (Proverbs 19:20). Ignoring established standards, such as those set by the authors of datasets, carries significant implications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib49" title="">49</a>]</cite>, reflecting the caution against neglecting wisdom in Proverbs 1:29-31. Such oversight can adversely affect not just the developers but also the NMT system’s end-users, leading to potential biases or inaccuracies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib50" title="">50</a>]</cite>, reminiscent of societal challenges highlighted in Hosea 4:6 due to ignorance. This scenario advocates for a balanced approach that marries technical skill with ethical mindfulness, echoing the societal virtues of wisdom and learning. The involvement of Institutional Review Boards (IRB) in emphasizing data privacy, informed consent, and risk management aligns with the Biblical appreciation for wise counsel (Proverbs 12:15), promoting the development of responsible and reliable NMT systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p4.1">What’s more, linguists’ feedback on NMT system output can be invaluable to developers who continually seek to refine and enhance the capabilities of these systems. It is paramount, however, that developers maintain an open-minded approach to iteration<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>. Navigating challenges such as handling out-of-vocabulary words, adapting to language evolution, and tailoring NMT systems to specific tasks requires a commitment to ongoing improvement and flexibility. Related studies also emphasise this approach by suggesting various feedback incorporation approaches such as Human-in-the-loop learning context based education systems, re-read and feedback mechanisms and mixed reality learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p5.1">Finally, in this paper the aurthors coil the phrase ’Blame is to human, not the Model’. It aptly encapsulates the narrative that AI models, in themselves, do not possess ethical agency; rather, the responsibility lies with the developers. A study evaluating the performance of GPT-4 in responding to complex medical ethical vignettes demonstrated that while the model could identify and articulate key ethical issues, it struggled with the nuanced aspects of ethical dilemmas and misapplied certain moral principles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib51" title="">51</a>]</cite>. This highlights the limitations of models in comprehending real-world ethical complexities. Nonetheless, this recognition does not diminish the ongoing efforts to establish frameworks for adhering to ethical guidelines in the deployment of AI systems within organizations. Biblically, this concept echoes the narrative in Genesis 1:28, where God grants man dominion over the earth, entrusting humans with stewardship and responsibility over all creation. This scripture has often been interpreted as bestowing upon humanity not just authority, but also the accountability for their actions and decisions, a principle that resonates with the modern ethical discourse surrounding AI development and use.</p>

</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS1.p1.1">Developers must prioritize creating NMT systems that are not only efficient but also ethically responsible, transparent, and fair. As NMT contributes significantly to the AI ecosystem, its role in advancing towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emphasizes the need for a strong ethical foundation. This is particularly relevant as AI legislation evolves worldwide. The academic world, merging with AI progress, encounters distinct ethical and regulatory challenges, highlighting the necessity for precise guidelines for ethical AI application in educational technologies<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.01070v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>. Engaging actively with legal standards and integrating AI in education demands a commitment to ethical practices, akin to the wisdom in ”Let all things be done decently and in order” (1 Corinthians 14:40), ensuring AI serves to enhance, not undermine, educational integrity and inclusivity.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p1.1">As reliance on AI and neural network-based tools like NMT systems grows, it’s imperative for the next generation of developers to ensure these models are ethically sound and uphold fairness. This begins with comprehensive education during their training, where they learn to navigate ethical challenges in AI development. This paper aims to inspire both new and seasoned developers to view their work through an ethical lens and understand their societal impact. Reflecting on the notion that individuals have roles and purposes as highlighted in spiritual texts, developers are encouraged to see their contributions to AI and NMT not just as technical tasks but as fulfilling a broader societal responsibility, thereby upholding ethical standards and contributing positively to society.</p>
