<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">A recent take towards <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Analytics</span> (FA), which allows analytical insights of distributed datasets, reuses the Federated Learning (FL) infrastructure to evaluate the summary of model performances across the training devices. However, the current realization of FL adopts single server-multiple client architecture with limited scope for FA, which often results in learning models with poor generalization, i.e., an ability to handle new/unseen data, for real-world applications. Moreover, a hierarchical FL structure with distributed computing platforms demonstrates incoherent model performances at different aggregation levels. Therefore, we need to design a robust learning mechanism than the FL that (i) unleashes a viable infrastructure for FA and (ii) trains learning models with better generalization capability. In this work, we adopt the novel democratized learning (Dem-AI) principles and designs to meet these objectives. Firstly, we show the hierarchical learning structure of the proposed edge-assisted democratized learning mechanism, namely <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Edge-DemLearn</span>, as a practical framework to empower generalization capability in support of FA. Secondly, we validate Edge-DemLearn as a flexible model training mechanism to build a distributed control and aggregation methodology in regions by leveraging the distributed computing infrastructure. The distributed edge computing servers construct regional models, minimize the communication loads, and ensure distributed data analytic application’s scalability. To that end, we adhere to a near-optimal two-sided many-to-one matching approach to handle the combinatorial constraints in Edge-DemLearn and solve it for fast knowledge acquisition with optimization of resource allocation and associations between multiple servers and devices. Extensive simulation results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the Google AI team published an article on leveraging computing mechanism of the distributed learning model training infrastructure to facilitate data analytics, namely <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Analytics</span> (FA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. FA allows data scientists to derive analytical insights of distributed datasets without the need of moving data to a central computing entity. This concept gathered keen attention for a new approach to data science, and interestingly, at the time when the centralized repositories are termed “vulnerable” towards privacy for data collection, and the era of distributed computing and storage is prominent. Besides, it means that apart from considering the distributed model training processes for improving model accuracy, we can exploit such collaboration architecture to evaluate the quality of the trained model at the user-level perspectives, i.e., the model performance at the user’s end. Hence, <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">without the learning part</span>, we can reuse the computing scheme of the learning architecture to perform statistical analysis on local data that may lead to building better products. To elaborate this idea further, consider an example of a prediction model where the developer would be interested in finding popular contents to store in a shared regional database without breaking into user’s historical content usage data. An intuitive answer to this question would be to find the frequently requested content at first, which is best done with FA. This is similar to the <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Now Playing</span> feature on Google’s Pixel phones for managing regional song database <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> to show users songs playing around them. In addition, leveraging distributed multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers further allows fast knowledge acquisition to serve user’s requests, limit privacy leakages, and improve the <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">on-the-fly</span> learning process. Furthermore, this also brings FA closer to where the data is collected, i.e., at the one-hop proximity of user devices. In such scenarios, the developer’s objective would be to improve the model’s accuracy and, concurrently, enhance the generalization performance of the model at the user level for maintaining regional databases using FA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this regard, the ubiquitous presence of edge computing devices such as mobile phones and sensors has unleashed the potential of exploiting distributed data for several learning applications, namely <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">edge learning</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This has opened up further opportunities to renovate the edge learning architectures for FA. Besides, the improvement in computational capabilities of the next-generation mobile devices using systems-on-chip (SoC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> has helped leverage distributed on-device model training mechanism to realize different learning schemes. Nevertheless, there are concerns related to privacy issues to fully tap the benefits of distributed data and perform statistical analysis upon them for various services, e.g., regional database management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. To that end, FA can work together with federated learning (FL), which is a promising paradigm to address privacy concerns during model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and supports with the computing infrastructure for FA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, the current rigid topology of the FL architecture in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> hinders the full potential of exploiting FA for next-generation of personalized applications. In particular, the typical realization of FL over wireless adopts a straightforward single server-multiple client architecture with limited scope for FA. Moreover, a hierarchical FL structure with distributed computing platforms results in incoherent model performances at different aggregation levels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, besides FL infrastructure being considered an appropriate framework for FA, another practical issue for FL over the wireless environment is the channel variations. Hence, the communication cost between the devices and the MEC server strongly affects the learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, leading poor model quality. Furthermore, the number of UEs involved in the distributed model training is another critical factor that affects the quality of the trained global model and learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is imperative to efficiently allocate limited wireless resources while taking care of devices’ local computing strategies to enhance communication efficiency further, and meet the requirements for FA as mentioned above. Also, several inherent issues, such as statistical and system-level heterogeneity, scalability, highly personalized and unbalanced data triggers the most critical challenge of vanilla FL implementation over wireless networks: improving both the learning performance at the user’s end, namely <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">personalized learning</em> performance, and an ability to handle new/unseen data, namely the <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">generalization capability</em>, for the real-world applications such as in healthcare, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. However, the current implementation of FL denounces user-level heterogeneity. It restricts users from forming groups and collaborating as per the characteristics of their learning tasks, which affects personalization. Further, this scenario also limits efficient knowledge transfer, which is in terms of model parameters aggregation at a different aggregation level, and <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">knowledge acquisition time</span>. We term such scenario as the inability of <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">self-organization</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this regard, several works tackle above challenges under two broader domains to meet <span id="S1.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">communication-efficient</span> and <span id="S1.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">energy-efficient</span> FL implementations, while leaving aside the expected robust framework for FA: i) resource management in radio access networks and ii) client selection. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> implemented an over-the-air computation approach to facilitate fast aggregation via joint device selection and beamforming design. Similarly, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> evaluated various trade-offs in FL schemes over wireless networks involving the uncertainty of wireless channels and heterogeneous participating devices. In particular, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> explored and optimized the inter-dependencies between the computation-communication latency and learning time-energy consumption constraints for improving learning performance. However, the underlying network architecture is <span id="S1.SS1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">traditional</span> (a single server and multiple devices collaboratively training a single model, and data homogeneity is considered), similar to several existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and haven’t analyzed hierarchical knowledge transfer at different network points, such as edge nodes. Thus, this limits the involvement of edge infrastructure to support hierarchical knowledge transfer and minimizes the model training time. Also, the single trained model, naively imposed on devices in each communication round, is poor in generalization, resulting in larger generalization errors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is necessary to have a distributed learning mechanism that considers the personal attributes of participating devices and results in tailored individual models while collaborating to train a global model with better generalization abilities.</p>

In particular, we discuss a typical FL setting, several related algorithms, and its implementation challenges over wireless networks such as intermittent network connectivity, statistical and system-level heterogeneity, resource allocation and participation, convergence guarantees, and personalization-generalization errors. Second, we review available solution approaches to realize FL over wireless networks. Basically, we discuss related works on handling communication bottleneck and delays, resource allocation strategies (i.e., computing and communication resources), participants selection, system-level heterogeneity, and convergence time minimization in doing so for several network architectures.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL scheme, the local dataset collected at each UE is unbalanced and highly personalized, which reflects the personality of each UE (or users). Adopting a simple model averaging scheme in FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> or FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> using local parameters of learning UEs who have exceedingly different characteristics may result in poor personalized performance. In this regard, on the one hand, recent works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> made the first attempt to study the personalization in FL, however, the correlation between generalization and personalization was not adequately analyzed. On the other hand, algorithms like FedAvg show poor performance in a wireless environment, and in particular, due to the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, i.e., non-i.i.d. (independent and identical distribution) and unbalanced dataset, and system-level heterogeneity on the accuracy of trained model and the convergence rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. This is in line to the findings when adopting several other distributed learning algorithms such as Parallel-Stochastic Gradient Descent (P-SGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and Decentralized-Parallel SGD (D-PSGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> as well. In a general distributed setting like FL, where the UEs frequently interact with a central aggregator, such algorithms are vulnerable in the centralized wireless setting due to untimely or delayed parameter exchanges, requiring larger communication rounds between the UEs and the aggregator; and hence, resulting poor communication efficiency. In order to improve the communication efficiency, techniques of quantization (e.g., signSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, Q-SGD<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>), compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, and sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> have been studied. In this regards, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> discussed about a family of new randomized methods combining SGD, with primal and
dual variants such as Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG), Federated Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (FSVRG) and Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA). More recently, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> analyzed the convergence rate of the distributed gradient descent considering resource constrained edge computing system. Considerably, all of these works aim to enable communication-efficient FL, and further study the convergence properties.
Apart from techniques such as model compression, quantization, and coding to reduce the communication overheads required in distributed learning, optimal scheduling and radio resource distribution amongst UEs in a wireless setting is imperative for its practical implementation. In this regard, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed a joint device scheduling and resource allocation to minimize overall model training time. Similarly, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors focused on minimizing learning time while improving communication efficiency to realize FL over wireless networks. Here, the authors considered a general network architecture where multiple devices are connected to a single base station (BS) for model parameter aggregation. Similarly, several works such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> have also considered the energy consumption while optimizing learning performance in the distributed machine learning paradigm of FL. In particular, optimal local computations and communication metrics are derived to solve an optimization problem defined as the weighted sum of learning time and the energy consumption. However, the outstanding issue related with generalization and specialization is overlooked. To that end, a few works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> have discussed a hierarchical structure in realizing FL model training. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> presented a hierarchical federated learning (HFL) scheme to improve communication latency without compromising the achievable accuracy of the trained model. Similarly, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, which is closely related to ours, the authors considered an edge-cloud hierarchical architecture to perform model aggregation and proposed an energy-efficient resource scheduling algorithm to obtain model training performance gain compared to the vanilla FL setting. Unlike this work, we have considered multi-level operation leveraging flexible model aggregation framework for regional model construction in a HetNet environment for FA. In particular, under our proposed mechanism, the devices group amongst themselves to improve their specialization abilities, minimize generalization errors via knowledge transfer at different hierarchical layers and obtain higher performance gain for the trained global model. Furthermore, we focus more on improving knowledge acquisition period leveraging MEC servers at the network edges following Dem-AI principles, rather than just considering users scheduling in the proposed network architecture.</p>

Furthermore, UEs can also change their associations with the SBSs following a certain rule.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For a given learning task, each UE in the cellular network can run multiple iterations over their available data samples to train a local learning model. Following the multi-connectivity scenario, these UEs can transmit such local models to the SBSs available in the coverage area. The MBS facilitates these associations between UEs and SBSs following some strategy (discussed in Section <a href="#S5" title="V Proposed Solution Approach ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>) to perform model aggregation, and further executes hierarchical clustering mechanism to form logical learning groups based on the similarities in learning characteristics of UEs such as the model parameters, i.e., the gradients and weights. The UEs in each logical learning group will try to improve their personal learning model (the process named as <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Specialization</span>) while considering the attributes of generalized global model to minimize generalization errors (the process named as <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Generalization</span>), i.e., the model performance on unseen or new data samples. Note that the local model parameters of each UE in a particular logical learning group are firstly aggregated at the SBSs, and then the partial aggregated group learning models are forwarded to the MBS for all-group aggregation to construct regional learning model. Thus, this results in partial in-group model aggregation corresponding to their groups at the SBS. Whereas, at the MBS, the full model aggregation, i.e., inner-group and then intra-group is performed to build a generalized regional model. Hence, we observe aggregation being carried out at different levels in an edge-assisted hierarchical learning in HetNet topology, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III System Model ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which are primarily facilitated by multi-connectivity and distributed MEC<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>The MEC also acts as an analytics server.</span></span></span> infrastructures. While the system architecture is flexible enough to leverage distributed computing nodes like MEC servers for distributed aggregation, the central idea is to improve the overall learning performance (i.e., better specialization and generalization) to an accuracy level.</p>

Hence, taking multi-connectivity into account instead of traditional fixed connectivity approach, UEs can exploit a number of radio links to find a suitable one that improves the overall model aggregation time in a democratized learning paradigm. In fact, this is in line with the requirements of the next generation machine learning applications where reliability should be considered while accelerating the knowledge acquisition process via edge computing infrastructures.</p>

For the ease of representation and analysis of the main proposal of this paper, i.e., edge-assisted democratized learning framework towards FA, we resort limiting the proposed general framework, as in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III System Model ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, to a 2-level structure with a regional MBS and associated SBSs, which we have explained in the Section <a href="#S3" title="III System Model ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. Hence, in a region, the MEC server manages the collaborative learning process and knowledge integration from groups and learning UEs. Whereas, at the MBS, we perform regional level aggregation related with overall in-group and intra-group models. Besides, given the UEs exchanging only the model parameters with the MEC servers and not their raw data, the approach is privacy-preserving compared to conventional machine learning at a central entity (or remote cloud) with UEs’ local data transferred. And different from two steps of aggregation in client-edge-cloud hierarchical FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, we propose updates in MEC servers at the SBS and regional aggregation at the MBS; hence, we unleash a novel infrastructure for FA at different levels.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The resource allocation problem can be formulated independently as in Subsection <a href="#S3.SS5" title="III-E Transmission Time Measurements ‣ III System Model ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-E</span></span></a>; however, edge-assisted Dem-AI system would have synergy benefits using novel designs for the communication and learning problem. In particular, considering the trade-offs between the learning performance and resource utility objectives can efficiently improve the learning performance of the regional model under the limited regional resource constraints. Moreover, learning groups compete with each other for communication resources to accommodate large group members, ensure frequent model updates, and thereby improve the group learning performance.
However, the formulated problem is challenging due to the complex fusion of existing resource allocation schemes, the usability of heterogeneous access networks, the locations of learning group members among different SBSs, and the coupling learning performance of groups and regional model.

Similarly, at the MBS, each group aggregation can only complete after receiving personalized models from all members who are associated with the corresponding SBSs.
Hence, it pose a problem of joint resource allocation amongst UEs in the proposed 2-layer HetNet architecture. Furthermore, these joint decisions can be made by solving the problem given the predetermined local training time of UEs based on their learning capabilities and the number of gradient-based updates of personalized learning problem.

Following <span id="S4.SS3.p2.2.29" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span>, the updated constraint (<a href="#S4.E16" title="In IV-C Edge-assisted Democratized Learning: a General Formulation ‣ IV A framework for Dem-AI systems at the network edge ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) ensures all UEs associated with logical learning groups in the network will perform the model training. Constraints (<a href="#S4.E16" title="In IV-C Edge-assisted Democratized Learning: a General Formulation ‣ IV A framework for Dem-AI systems at the network edge ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) and (<a href="#S4.E16" title="In IV-C Edge-assisted Democratized Learning: a General Formulation ‣ IV A framework for Dem-AI systems at the network edge ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>), respectively, requires that one UE cannot belong to more than one logical learning group to perform local model updates and transmission to multiple SBSs at a time. Moreover, we observe optimization problem <span id="S4.SS3.p2.2.30" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P2</span> reveals a viable and more practical infrastructure other than basic single server-multiple clients architecture of FL towards FA. This unravels a new direction towards distributed database management by exploiting quality of model at different levels and regions. To that end, we also realize <span id="S4.SS3.p2.2.31" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P2</span> offers a flexible mechanism for fast knowledge acquisition that can be leveraged to derive statistical insights of distributed datasets, which is the objective of FA.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For a given number of UEs associated with a SBS, the resource allocation problem <span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span>
is a convex optimization, which can be solved using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, the problem <span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P2</span> is hard to solve due to the coupling of logical association constraints (<a href="#S4.E16" title="In IV-C Edge-assisted Democratized Learning: a General Formulation ‣ IV A framework for Dem-AI systems at the network edge ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) and (<a href="#S4.E16" title="In IV-C Edge-assisted Democratized Learning: a General Formulation ‣ IV A framework for Dem-AI systems at the network edge ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) with allocation of computation and communication resources in the objective. Furthermore, the combinatorial nature of the problem, which is generally NP-hard, makes it challenging to establish a robust, self-organizing learning architecture envisioned for the next generation of applications. In this regard, considering the suitability of matching theory to overcome such challenges, we adopt a two-sided many-to-one matching algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which produces feasible sub-optimal solutions with low-complexity. In particular, we leverage three fundamental benefits of matching theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>: (i) ability of decentralized operations that can capture complex network components, (ii) distributed resource management with guarantees of stability, and (iii) self-organized, low-complexity and sub-optimal solutions, to fulfill the objective of Edge-DemLearn. In the following section, we present the details of our solution approach.</p>

In what follows, we execute the Dem-AI process and employ hierarchical clustering based on local model parameters, i.e., weights and gradients, to organize UEs in multiple logical learning groups. To that end, a two-sided many-to-one matching is applied to improve the knowledge acquisition process during model parameters aggregation at the SBSs by associating appropriate set of UEs in multiple logical learning groups under each SBS. In doing so, we exploit the interactions between UEs in different logical learning groups to handle the overall network-wide latency. This means, the UEs can leverage multi-connectivity and dynamically update their preference profiles to minimize their model aggregation latency with associated SBSs, whereas the SBS will also update its preference lists to improve the overall utility value which is defined in terms of parameter aggregation time.
The MBS mediates this process to obtain a stable matching solution for solving <span id="S5.p3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P2</span>.

In our problem, the UEs can exploit multi-connectivity and switch its association between SBSs to minimize the model aggregation time for fast knowledge acquisition. This is particularly done to avoid “stragglers” issues in the performance of the proposed learning system. To be specific, the preference of UEs to specific SBS may change as per the other UEs association to that SBS. Therefore, we draw the following conclusion.</p>

Furthermore, the UEs may want to propose a change in their association with the SBSs to minimize the experienced latency at their end.

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Once the stable matching is reached, the UEs undergo executing Dem-AI learning mechanism (line 19–line 27). First, UEs will perform rounds of local iterations over their data samples leveraging higher-level generalized model (line 21–line 22). In particular, the UEs will implement stochastic gradient descent method to solve a personalized local objective function and produce local model parameters. The UEs will transmit back these parameters to their corresponding SBSs for partial aggregation of group models, and then to the MBS for building regional generalized model, following Dem-AI learning process (as described in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Synergy of Resource Allocation and Learning ‣ IV A framework for Dem-AI systems at the network edge ‣ Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a>).

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.8" class="ltx_p">We consider a typical supervised learning setting to compare the efficacy of our proposed solution approach, Edge-DemLearn, against the well-known federated averaging algorithm, shortly FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, over wireless networks. In fact, FedAvg is a common comparison baseline that works well with heterogeneous UEs communicating with a single aggregation server in the wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, i.e., in a typical multiple UEs-single server architecture. However, different from existing approaches, in this work, we develop a hierarchical learning structure with distributed aggregation and control methodologies at the SBSs and the MBS in a 2-layer heterogeneous network topology. Then, given the stable matching solution, we first evaluate the performance of trained model for three distinct learning metrics to support FA: (i) Regional, (ii) Client Specialization, and (iii) Client Generalization, on MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, Fashion-MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, and benchmark dataset Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. Regional metric is the evaluation of model performance at the MBS, i.e., a regional level in our system model. Client Specialization and Client Generalization, respectively, are the evaluations of the trained model in the UE’s local test data only and the unseen data which is prepared collecting test data from all UEs in the region. We shuffle and divide the dataset to replicate its unbalanced and non-i.i.d. properties at each UE; data samples are drawn particularly from two labels out of ten for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST.

The results are intuitive as Edge-DemLearn finds the best configuration and optimizes the network resources when associating the subset of UEs with SBSs. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm gives near-optimal solution, which is of low-complexity than the Optimal. Moreover, we observe high variance in the obtained solution using the Random and Uniform schemes. This is because they suffer from both random placement of UEs in the network following a HPPP and an inefficient allocation of network resources at each initialization. Also, note that One-sided scheme shows competitive performance in terms of overall delay; however, it cannot satisfy the objective of self-organizing hierarchical learning structure in support of FA because it restricts the preferences of UEs as fixed.</p>

The reason is that in a congested network scenario, the random association strategy restricts appropriate selection of UEs to improve overall knowledge acquisition time. Thus, resulting in more enormous delays. Furthermore, limited RBs hinder UEs’ participation in an optimal way; hence, lowering the utility of the associated SBSs. Whereas the proposed algorithm allows SBSs and UEs to match in their best interest, thus improving the average total delay.</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The hierarchical self-organizing structure of Edge-DemLearn requires UEs to share only the local learning information (i.e., the models and gradients) to their associated SBSs instead of the available raw datasets. To an extent, this facilities the data privacy of UEs; however, an adversary may reproduce the local training data samples, or its properties by exploiting the shared model information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> at different aggregation levels. Besides, apart from such adversarial inferences, leakages from aggregates also challenge the data privacy in Edge-DemLearn. In this regard, instead of averaging all local model parameters into a single model at the particular SBS, the Edge-DemLearn framework first performs partial in-group model aggregation (i.e., models are averaged based on their learning groups). Thus, it challenges differential attacks at the SBSs, and furthermore, can execute privacy-preserving functions of Differential Privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to mitigate privacy loss. Moreover, in the MBS, these partial aggregated in-group models undergo hierarchical averaging (i.e., in-group averaging considering the information received from the SBSs, followed by intra-group averaging) to build the regional model. In such a case, using a central DP method at the MBS, the Edge-DemLearn can protect UEs from adversarial attacks strongly. Following this, Edge-DemLearn can ensure the privacy of participating UEs’ local data in the hierarchical model aggregation topology.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have proposed a novel edge-assisted democratized learning mechanism, namely <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Edge-DemLearn</span>, which unleashes a more practical hierarchical and distributed learning structure to support FA, while improving generalization capability (i.e., 95%) of the trained model. In particular, the propose architecture leverages distributed MEC infrastructures at different regional levels to derive statistical insights on distributed datasets. To that end, we have developed a robust distributed control and aggregation methodology in regions by leveraging distributed MEC platforms in a HetNet environment. In doing so, we have adopted a multi-connectivity scenario to realize the hierarchical structure for FA, and applied a two-sided many-to-one matching algorithm with externalities to optimize the overall system performance during user associations and resource allocation. To that end, we have shown the proposed hierarchical structure enables fast knowledge acquisition (around 26.2% improvement) to meet needs of both FA and model quality for future large-scale distributed learning systems. As compared with the prominent FL model training algorithm, such as FedAvg, using simulations on real datasets, we have shown the proposed approach can offer significant performance while minimizing the average total delays during knowledge acquisition.</p>
