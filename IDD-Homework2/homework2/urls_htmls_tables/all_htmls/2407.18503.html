<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper aims to propose a novel framework to address the data privacy issue for Federated Learning (FL)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs) with limited computational resources. In particular, in conventional FL systems, it is usually assumed that the computing nodes have sufficient computational resources to process the training tasks. However, in practical IoV systems, vehicles usually have limited computational resources to process intensive training tasks, compromising the effectiveness of deploying FL in IDSs. While offloading data from vehicles to the cloud can mitigate this issue, it introduces significant privacy concerns for vehicle users (VUs). To resolve this issue, we first propose a highly-effective framework using homomorphic encryption to secure data that requires offloading to a centralized server for processing. Furthermore, we develop an effective training algorithm tailored to handle the challenges of FL-based systems with encrypted data. This algorithm allows the centralized server to directly compute on quantum-secure encrypted ciphertexts without needing decryption. This approach not only safeguards data privacy during the offloading process from VUs to the centralized server but also enhances the efficiency of utilizing FL for IDSs in IoV systems. Our simulation results show that our proposed approach can achieve a performance that is as close to that of the solution without encryption, with a gap of less than 0.8%.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has witnessed as a significant research field with the development of intelligent transport systems (ITSs), connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), and in-vehicle networks (IVNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Particularly, IoV is a combination of VANET and IoT, which is built based on the communication standards of VANET <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In the IoV network, the vehicles equipped with IoT sensors can transmit and exchange data via the roadside units (RSUs), thereby providing intelligent decision-making based on the collected data. However, the massive network connectivity in IoV leads to substantial concerns in cybersecurity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Regarding cyber threats, the IoV networks are vulnerable to various attacks. For example, the attacker can impersonate one vehicle in the network stream to steal or inject false information into a vulnerable vehicle via a spoofing attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Additionally, traditional cyberattacks, such as denial of service (DoS), can severely impact IoV networks by overwhelming them with an intensive volume of traffic, thereby disrupting network services. Therefore, effective detection and defence solutions for cybersecurity in IoV networks are urgently needed to ensure the integrity, reliability, and safety of connected vehicle systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach that can integrate with modern networks to form an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS). Regarding IoV networks, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> propose a Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Network (ConvLSTM) to detect anomalies in IoT sensors integrated CAVs. The simulation results show that the deep learning model can detect various anomalies in sensor data with an F1-score of 97%. Moreover, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the authors evaluate various deep learning techniques to detect attacks in vehicular network traffic, which achieve accuracy from 92% to nearly 99%. However, traditional deep learning approaches operate based on centralized learning paradigms, which may not be efficient for the decentralized nature of IoV/IoT networks. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) is a significant solution that allows deep learning models to learn with decentralized user-generated data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Regarding IoT networks, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> propose a collaborative framework that utilizes FL for intrusion detection in IoT networks. Experiment results using Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Autoencoder (DAE) show the accuracy of detection from 93% to 98%.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the advantage of FL in IDSs, there are still some major challenges when deploying it in practical IoV networks. Specifically, in FL-based IDS in IoV networks, vehicles or RSUs often serve as workers to store and process all the learning tasks (e.g., training and classification) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, in practice, both RSUs and vehicles usually have limited computing and storage resources, and thus, storing and processing learning tasks at RSUs and VUs are ineffective. It is important to note that in conventional FL processes, a delay from one computing node can cause a delay for the whole system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Therefore, several works propose solutions to upload data from RSUs and vehicles to powerful servers (e.g., centralized servers) for processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. This approach can be very effective in deploying ML algorithms as all the data is collected and processed at the centralized servers. However, it also raises a serious concern regarding the data privacy of VUs, as all the data is now stored and processed externally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the above challenges, we propose a novel privacy-preserving FL framework for intrusion detection in IoV networks. The proposed framework can effectively protect VUs’ privacy and detect cyberattacks, given VUs’ limited computational resources. Specifically, based on the current computing and storage resource capabilities, VUs can decide the amount of data they need to upload to the server for processing. To preserve the privacy of the VUs, this data will be encrypted by employing Homomorphic Encryption (HE) before being uploaded to the server. While this encryption method enhances data privacy, it presents significant challenges for the centralized server, which is tasked with training on the encrypted data offloaded from the VUs. To tackle this issue, we develop a robust training algorithm leveraging the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) and the bootstrapping capabilities of the underlying HE scheme. This enables direct computation on the quantum-secure encrypted ciphertexts without the need for decryption. This approach not only maintains the confidentiality of data during the offloading process from VUs to the centralized server but also boosts the efficiency of using FL for IDSs within IoV networks. Simulation results on real-world datasets show that our proposed framework achieves not only a high accuracy (approximately 91%) in detecting attacks but also exhibits great performance, closely approaching the benchmark without using encryption (with a gap of less than 0.8%).</p>

Initially, the VUs enter the pre-learning phase by assessing their computational resources and determining the optimal amount of data that can be processed locally. The rest of the data will be offloaded to the centralized server for processing. However, before offloading the data to the centralized servers, VUs will generate HE key pairs and use them to encrypt uploading data. The encrypted data will then be offloaded to the centralized server via RSUs, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>. Upon receiving the offloaded encrypted data, the centralized server will compile it into an encrypted dataset. Using this dataset, two learning models will be developed: the server model and the global model, each serving distinct purposes. The server model will be utilized to train the encrypted dataset within the centralized server, whereas the global model will be distributed to the VUs for local training. Once the global model is sent to the VUs, the privacy-preserving learning process will commence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The privacy-preserving learning process will be divided into different learning periods. During each learning period, each VU will use the global model to train on its local data. After completing the training, the VU will encrypt its trained model before sending it to the centralized server. Concurrently, the centralized server will train its encrypted data using our proposed CKKS scheme, detailed in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A The Classification-based Deep Neural Network for Encrypted Data ‣ III The Privacy-Preserving FL Framework for Encrypted Data ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>. Upon receiving all the encrypted trained models from the VUs, the centralized server will aggregate them to create a new global model (the aggregation method is detailed in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B The Proposed FL Implementation ‣ III The Privacy-Preserving FL Framework for Encrypted Data ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a>). This updated global model is then sent back to the VUs, and the next learning period begins.

The Edge-IIoT dataset includes 20 million raw normal traffic and attack traffic collected from 13 IoT devices. Attacks can be grouped into the five most common types, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Injection, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), Malware, and Reconnaissance. After applying downsample and oversample to overcome the imbalance, the dataset includes 31,400 samples with details presented in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-A Simulation Setup ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. Subsequently, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets (80%-20%). The training and testing sets are then nominalized and scaled within the range of (0,1). Regarding the neural network, we design a fully connected network consisting of an input layer, 2 hidden layers, and an output layer. The respective layers contain 32, 16, 16, and 6 neurons. Apart from the input layer, each layer is attached to the SiLU activation function.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">During the simulation, we assume that the collected dataset of each VU has the same class distribution. Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, we consider the approach to offload partial data to the server as the benchmark for our proposed framework. Nevertheless, it is noted that in such a benchmark, the FL framework does not consider the privacy of the VUs. In this scenario, we train the non-encrypted data using the non-encrypted model at both CS and VUs. Consequently, the trained global model is employed to evaluate the accuracy of our proposed framework and other benchmarks. In our experiment setup, the proposed framework consists of 2 VUs and 3 VUs, which can send 10% and 20% of their local data.</p>

As observed in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Evaluation Metrics ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Evaluation Metrics ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a> with 2 VUs, the CFL converges after 70 iterations, while the N-EncFL and EncFL require nearly 100 iterations to reach the convergence. Specifically, due to the different amounts of data handled by the VU, the CFL demonstrates a slightly better convergence rate compared to other approaches. Despite the trivial difference in convergence, the accuracy during the learning process of the three approaches remains nearly identical, stabilizing at approximately 92%. Additionally, Fig. <a href="#S4.F3.sf3" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Evaluation Metrics ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(c)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F3.sf4" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Evaluation Metrics ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(d)</span></a> describe the convergences in the scenarios with 3 VUs. Although the N-EncFL and traditional methods converge at nearly the same time, the EncFL require over 100 iterations to reach the convergence, which is slightly longer than other approaches. However, the gap in learning rate, which is about 15 to 20 iterations, is trivial. It is worth noting that the accuracy of EncFL remains consistent with that of the N-EncFL and CFL, regardless of whether the amount of offloaded data is different. As a result, the proposed framework, which operates on encrypted data, achieves the same accuracy as those of the other benchmarks, i.e., N-EncFL and CFL.</p>

Overall, the accuracy, precision and recall of the two scenarios remain nearly identical. Regarding the different amounts of offloaded data, the results for N-EncFL and EncFL are close to those of other methods. Specifically, even when the data sent is 10% or 20%, the N-EncFL with two or three VUs achieves an accuracy of approximately 91.8%. A similar trend is observed with EncFL, where the accuracy remains consistent regardless of the varying amounts of data offloaded. When comparing the results of EncFL and N-EncFL, we can observe that the accuracy, precision and recall of EncFL are slightly lower than those of the N-EncFL. In detail, the gap between N-EncFL and EncFL with two VUs is from 0.5% to 0.6%. For instance, with 10% offloaded data, EncFL achieves an accuracy of 91.173%, which is 0.55% less than N-EncFL’s 91.728%. Additionally, the results of the three VUs show a similar pattern, with EncFL performing 0.6% to 0.8% less than RawFL. However, as observed in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-B Evaluation Metrics ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-C Simulation Results ‣ IV Performance Evaluation ‣ Homomorphic Encryption-Enabled Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained IoV Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the overall accuracy of 6 classes is nearly the same. The differences primarily lie in the detection of “Injection” and “Reconnaissance”, which accounts for the small gap between N-EncFL and EncFL. Although the accuracy of the “Injection” class of EncFL is less than N-EncFL, EncFL still achieves an 88% detection rate accuracy for the “Injection” attack. As a result, the small gap between N-EncFL and EncFL is acceptable, demonstrating that EncFL can classify each class with a high detection rate.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a novel privacy-preserving FL framework for intrusion detection in IoVs with limited computing resources. The proposed framework enables users to offload data to a centralized server, addressing the computational challenges during local training of the vehicles. To ensure user privacy, homomorphic encryption (HE) is applied to the data before offloading it to the server. The encrypted data is then processed by the training algorithm-based HE, which allows the server to learn from the encrypted data without knowing its content. The proposed framework can protect the privacy of users during the learning process, facilitating the efficient deployment of FL for IDSs in practical IoV networks. The simulation results show that our proposed framework can accurately detect cyberattacks in IoV networks. Although the accuracy of the encrypted neural network is slightly less than that of the raw ones, the gap is acceptable and can be optimized in future works.</p>
