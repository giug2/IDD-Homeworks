<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Machine Unlearning, a pivotal field addressing data privacy in machine learning, necessitates efficient methods for the removal of private or irrelevant data. In this context, significant challenges arise, particularly in maintaining privacy and ensuring model efficiency when managing outdated, private, and irrelevant data. Such data not only compromises model accuracy but also burdens computational efficiency in both learning and unlearning processes. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRAMU). This framework incorporates adaptive learning mechanisms, privacy preservation techniques, and optimization strategies, making it a well-rounded solution for handling various data sources, either single-modality or multi-modality, while maintaining accuracy and privacy. FRAMU’s strength lies in its adaptability to fluctuating data landscapes, its ability to unlearn outdated, private, or irrelevant data, and its support for continual model evolution without compromising privacy. Our experiments, conducted on both single-modality and multi-modality datasets, revealed that FRAMU significantly outperformed baseline models. Additional assessments of convergence behaviour and optimization strategies further validate the framework’s utility in federated learning applications. Overall, FRAMU advances Machine Unlearning by offering a robust, privacy-preserving solution that optimizes model performance while also addressing key challenges in dynamic data environments.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The widespread availability of decentralized and heterogeneous data sources has created a demand for Machine Learning models that can effectively leverage this data while preserving privacy and ensuring accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Traditional approaches struggle to handle the continual influx of new data streams, and the accumulation of outdated or irrelevant information hinders their adaptability in dynamic data environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.

The concept of the “right to be forgotten” allows individuals to have their personal information removed from online platforms, although there’s no universal agreement on its definition or its status as a human right <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

This verdict not only led to Google taking down the search results but also influenced broader European Union policies on the subject, emphasizing the urgent need for mechanisms that can efficiently erase outdated or private information from Machine Learning models without sacrificing accuracy. This critical requirement for Machine Unlearning is further highlighted by high-profile cases such as that of James Gunn, the famed writer and director, who was dismissed by Disney in 2018 when old, inappropriate tweets resurfaced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Challenges.</span> In today’s digitally connected environment, data is distributed in various forms and from different sources, such as sensors, text documents, images, and time series data. For unlearning outdated or private data, Machine Unlearning presents unique challenges depending on whether it is a single type of data (known as single-modality) or multiple types of data (referred to as multimodality) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. With single-modality data, the issue primarily lies in the build-up of outdated or irrelevant information, which can negatively affect the model’s effectiveness and precision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, multimodality situations are even more complicated. Here, each type of data can have different characteristics and varying contributions to the overall model’s performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. As we discussed in example <a href="#Thmexample1" title="Example 1. ‣ I Introduction ‣ FRAMU: Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the need to unlearn outdated or private data is most important. This ensures individuals have the “right to be forgotten” about their information in publicly available platforms. However, the unlearning needs to happen in both single-modality and multimodality data to make it a holistic unlearning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed learning systems, particularly federated learning, have made significant strides forward in enabling Machine Learning models to train on decentralized data, offering the dual advantage of reduced communication costs and enhanced privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Notable efforts have been made to incorporate Differential Privacy (DP) into these systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, ensuring robust privacy safeguards through techniques like DP-SGD and DP-FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, these existing frameworks face limitations when confronted with the dynamic nature of data distribution, an intrinsic challenge in distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Although some efforts have been made in Machine Unlearning to address data irrelevancy over time, such as Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated(SISA) training methods, these solutions often operate in isolation from privacy-preserving mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. This bifurcation leaves a crucial research gap: the absence of a unified approach that addresses both privacy concerns and the adaptability requirements in the face of ever-changing data landscapes. There is a need to bridge this gap by providing an integrated solution for robust privacy measures and efficient selective unlearning, thereby enabling Machine Learning models to be both secure and adaptable in dynamic, distributed environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The primary challenges in Machine Unlearning involve addressing the buildup of outdated or irrelevant information in single-modality data, which affects model precision, and handling the complexity of multimodality data where each type contributes differently to model performance. Additionally, current distributed learning systems, while advancing privacy and reducing communication costs, face limitations in adapting to dynamic data distributions and integrating robust privacy measures with efficient unlearning mechanisms, highlighting a need for a unified approach that ensures both security and adaptability in rapidly evolving data environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we propose an Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRAMU) as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FRAMU: Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. By integrating federated learning, adaptive learning mechanisms, and privacy preservation techniques, FRAMU aims to leverage the diverse and dynamic nature of data in both single-modality and multimodality scenarios, while upholding privacy regulations and optimizing the learning process. An attention mechanism is incorporated into FRAMU to ensure responsible and secure handling of sensitive information across modalities. FRAMU leverages reinforcement learning and adaptive learning mechanisms to enable models to dynamically adapt to changing data distributions and individual participant characteristics in both single-modality and multimodality scenarios. This adaptability facilitates ongoing model evolution and improvement in a privacy-preserving manner, accommodating the dynamic nature of the data present in federated learning scenarios. In addition to addressing the challenges associated with unlearning outdated, private, and irrelevant data in both single-modality and multimodality scenarios, FRAMU offers valuable insights into the convergence behaviour and optimization of the federated learning process.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The importance of data privacy in distributed learning systems has garnered significant attention, especially when handling sensitive types of data like medical or behavioral information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Differential Privacy (DP), a mathematically rigorous framework for ensuring individual privacy, has been widely adopted for this purpose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Efforts to integrate DP within distributed learning environments, particularly in federated learning, have been increasing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Abadi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> developed a seminal approach called Deep Learning with Differential Privacy (DP-SGD), which adapts the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to meet DP standards by clipping gradients and injecting noise, thereby offering stringent privacy safeguards during deep neural network (DNN) training. Building on this, McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> further tailored DP mechanisms for federated learning through an extension called DP-FedAvg. While these methods effectively address privacy concerns, they often fall short in dealing with dynamic data distributions, a prevalent issue in distributed learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Specifically, data sets can evolve over time, rendering some information outdated or irrelevant, and the persistence of such data in the learning process can compromise model efficacy. Although Machine Unlearning approaches like Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> have emerged to tackle this issue by enabling efficient selective forgetting of data, these methods are not yet designed to work synergistically with privacy-preserving techniques like DP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

Among the pioneering works in this area is the FedAvg algorithm by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which relies on model parameter averaging across local models and a central server. However, FedAvg is not without its limitations, particularly when handling non-IID data distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Solutions like FedProx by Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> have sought to address this by introducing a proximal term for improved model convergence. While other researchers like Sahu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and Konečný et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> have made strides in adaptive learning rates and communication efficiency, the realm of federated learning still faces significant challenges in dynamic adaptability and efficient Machine Unlearning. While privacy has been partially addressed through Differential Privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and Secure Multiparty Computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, these techniques often compromise on model efficiency. Additionally, the applicability of federated learning in diverse sectors like healthcare and IoT emphasizes the unmet need for a model capable of dynamically adapting to varied data distributions, while preserving privacy and efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>

Several pivotal advancements have shaped the field, including the development of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. DQNs combine traditional reinforcement learning techniques with DNNs, significantly enhancing the system’s ability to process high-dimensional inputs such as images. Furthermore, experience replay mechanisms have been integrated into them to improve learning stability by storing and reusing past experiences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Mnih et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> significantly accelerated the reinforcement learning field by implementing DQNs that achieved human-level performance on a variety of complex tasks. However, there are evident gaps in addressing challenges posed by non-stationary or dynamic environment situations where the statistical properties of the environment change over time. Under such conditions, a reinforcement learning agent’s ability to adapt quickly is paramount. Several approaches like meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and attention mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> have sought to remedy these issues to some extent. Meta-learning, for example, helps models quickly adapt to new tasks by training them on a diverse range of tasks. However, the technique does not offer a robust solution for unlearning or forgetting outdated or irrelevant information, which is crucial for maintaining performance in dynamic environments. In a similar vein, attention mechanisms help agents focus on important regions of the input space, but they also fail to address the need for efficient unlearning of obsolete or irrelevant data. This leaves us with a significant research gap: the lack of mechanisms for efficient unlearning and adaptability in reinforcement learning agents designed for non-stationary, dynamic environments.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A key challenge for federated learning when faced with dynamic data distributions and the accumulation of outdated or irrelevant information is its adaptability in evolving environments. Reinforcement learning has been instrumental in training agents for optimal decision-making in dynamic environments, yet it too grapples with the need to efficiently unlearn outdated or irrelevant data. These challenges underscore the importance of integrating attention mechanisms into the Machine Unlearning process. Unlike selective data deletion, attention mechanisms assign reduced weights to outdated, private, or irrelevant information. The dynamic adjustment of attention scores allows these models to prioritize relevant data while disregarding obsolete or extraneous elements. By bridging the worlds of federated learning and reinforcement learning with attention mechanisms, our study addresses the pressing need for an integrated solution that optimizes decision-making in distributed networks with changing data landscapes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. In addition, this approach must preserve data privacy and adaptively forget outdated, private, or irrelevant information.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The problem is defined by two distinct settings: single-modality and multimodality. The single-modality setting is simpler and widely applicable in scenarios with uniform data types, such as sensor networks or content recommendation systems. However, it may lack the context provided by different types of data, potentially leading to less nuanced decisions. On the other hand, the multimodality setting is more complex but highly relevant in fields like healthcare, where a range of data types (e.g., medical imaging, patient history, etc.) can be used for more comprehensive understanding and decision-making. By exploring the problem in both these settings, we offer solutions that are both versatile and contextually rich.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the multimodality setting, the complexity is elevated by the integration of heterogeneous data types and the application of specialized machine learning models for each modality. For example, in a healthcare system, combining data from disparate sources like medical imaging and patient history presents a unique challenge. Each data type, or modality, not only varies in format but also in the nature of the information it conveys, necessitating distinct processing and analysis methods. The key challenge here is to develop an integrated approach that effectively synthesizes these diverse data streams into a coherent understanding, enhancing decision-making in critical applications such as patient diagnosis and treatment. Attention mechanisms play a crucial role in this context, determining the relevance of each data point across different modalities. However, assigning and calibrating these attention scores is non-trivial and introduces an additional layer of complexity. The successful implementation of multimodal systems has profound implications, particularly in improving the accuracy and efficacy of decision-making processes.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In an era marked by an ever-increasing influx of data, the need for adaptive Machine Learning models that can efficiently unlearn outdated, private, or irrelevant information is paramount. The methodology proposed in this paper addresses this necessity by introducing two key technical contributions. First, we propose an adaptive unlearning algorithm that utilizes attention mechanisms to tailor the learning and unlearning processes in a single-modality, and then extend the process to multimodality. This innovative approach allows the model to adapt to dynamic changes in data distributions, as well as variations in participant characteristics such as demographic information, behavioural patterns, and data contribution frequencies among others. Second, we put forth a novel design that employs the FedAvg mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> to personalize the unlearning process. This design ensures that the model is able to discard data that has become irrelevant, outdated, or potentially invasive from a privacy perspective, thus preserving the integrity of the learning model while adapting to new or changing data. The following sections will elaborate on these contributions, providing a detailed discussion of the proposed framework as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-B Problem Definition - Multimodality ‣ III Preliminaries &amp; Problem Definition ‣ FRAMU: Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The FRAMU framework adopts a federated learning architecture comprising Local Agents and a Central Server, each with distinct roles in model training, unlearning, and adaptation. It employs a reinforcement learning paradigm where each agent iteratively learns from its environment. This integration of federated learning and reinforcement learning is termed federated reinforcement learning. However, what sets FRAMU apart is the integration of attention mechanisms to weigh the relevance of each data point in learning and unlearning. The attention scores are then aggregated and processed at the Central Server to refine the global model.</p>

Each step within the algorithm is crafted with specific intentions: The initialization stage (Lines 1-3) sets the groundwork by initializing local and global model parameters, as well as attention scores. These initializations are crucial for ensuring that both local and global perspectives are considered right from the start of the learning process. The iterative learning process (Lines 4-24) involves several key components. Local Agent Decision-Making (Lines 5-11) enables each local agent to observe states, take actions, and update its Q-values and attention scores, ensuring that local knowledge is continuously updated to reflect the dynamic nature of the agents’ environments. Central Server Aggregation (Lines 12-17) plays a pivotal role in integrating local updates and refining the global model. By assessing the attention scores, the server can identify and diminish the influence of less relevant data points, thereby enhancing the model’s focus on significant information. Model Synchronization (Lines 18-24) involves the dissemination of global model parameters back to local agents for fine-tuning, ensuring a bi-directional flow of information that keeps local models informed by their immediate environment and aligned with the broader objectives of the global model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.7" class="ltx_p">Central to FRAMU is an attention layer that functions as a specialized approximator, augmenting the learning capability of individual agents. This attention layer distinguishes itself by assigning attention scores to individual data points during the function approximation process. These scores serve as indicators of each data point’s relevance in the agent’s local learning. The agent updates these scores as it interacts with its environment and receives either rewards or penalties, thereby continually refining its model.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">After the global model is updated, it is disseminated back to local agents through a feedback loop. This cyclic interaction allows local agents to either initialize or further refine their models based on the global one. This is particularly beneficial when local agents confront new or unfamiliar data points that other agents have encountered. Through this mechanism, the global model acts as a repository of shared knowledge, enhancing the decision-making capabilities of all local agents.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To effectively evaluate the performance of the FRAMU framework, we undertook comprehensive experiments using real-world datasets. These experiments were designed to validate not only the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach but also to establish the practical utility of FRAMU in real-world applications. Our experimental setup encompassed several components, including datasets, baseline models, evaluation metrics, and specific FRAMU configurations, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-C3 Feedback Mechanisms ‣ V-C Continuous Adaptation and Learning in the FRAMU Framework ‣ V Applications of FRAMU ‣ FRAMU: Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. A critical aspect of our experimentation involved fine-tuning key thresholds to guide the unlearning process, particularly the outdated_threshold and irrelevant_threshold. These parameters were adjusted based on domain expertise and sensitivity analysis, with the outdated_threshold defining the time frame for data obsolescence and the irrelevant_threshold setting criteria for data’s statistical insignificance. Additionally, we introduced a privacy_epsilon parameter to balance data utility with privacy preservation, aligning with GDPR regulations.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning methods are known for their ability to learn features autonomously and automate model-building processes. Despite criticisms of neural network family algorithms for their ’black box’ nature, deep learning models are renowned for their robust and efficient performance. These models are widely adopted by the research community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. In our work, we utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image and sensor data, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for time series and text data, specifically tailored for federated learning scenarios. This model choice was made to efficiently handle both single and multimodal data types, integrating attention mechanisms and unlearning processes to enhance overall functionality.</p>

It was essential to strike the right balance in the outdated threshold to prevent premature data discarding or retention of outdated information, which could affect model accuracy and relevancy. Similarly, careful calibration of the irrelevant threshold was necessary to maintain a balance between data comprehensiveness and quality, ensuring useful data was not excluded nor excessive noise retained.

This was key for local models to benefit from global insights while preserving their unique learning characteristics. The interplay of these hyperparameters significantly influenced FRAMU’s performance, particularly in its ability to adapt to new data and retain relevant historical information. Through sensitivity analyses, we determined their optimal ranges, aiming to maximize FRAMU’s efficiency and adaptability in various real-world scenarios.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FRAMU framework is evaluated using several important metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, Reconstruction Error (RE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>, and Activation Distance (AD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. A lower MSE or MAE score shows that the unlearning process is closely aligned with what was expected, indicating a high quality of unlearning. The RE measures how well the model can rebuild data that it has unlearned, with a lower score being better. AD measures the average distance between the predictions of the model before and after unlearning, using what is known as L2-distance, on a specific set of forgotten data. These metrics together give a well-rounded evaluation of how well the unlearning process is working.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To assess the effectiveness of FRAMU in unlearning outdated, private, and irrelevant data, we analyzed the results from various experiments. FRAMU’s performance was benchmarked against that of established baseline models: FedLU, Zero-shot MU, and SISA Training. It’s important to note that the METR-LA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> was excluded from the private data unlearning evaluation due to its lack of privacy-sensitive data. For a thorough comparison, we present the performance metrics of FRAMU in unlearning outdated, private, and irrelevant data alongside the results from baseline models in Tab. <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VI-B Baseline Models ‣ VI Experimental Setup and Results Analysis ‣ FRAMU: Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.

<p id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The unlearning of outdated data is vital for maintaining model accuracy and relevance. Outdated data might introduce noise, biases, or outdated patterns. By selectively unlearning such data, FRAMU aims to align the model with the latest data distribution. FRAMU consistently achieved lower MSE and MAE than the baseline models in unlearning outdated data across various datasets. This improvement, evident from the low p-values in Tab. <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VI-B Baseline Models ‣ VI Experimental Setup and Results Analysis ‣ FRAMU: Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, demonstrates FRAMU’s statistically significant superiority in adapting models to current data distributions.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The retention of private data in models can pose significant privacy and legal risks. To mitigate this, FRAMU incorporates techniques for unlearning private data while preserving privacy. Excluding the METR-LA dataset from this analysis, FRAMU consistently outperformed the baseline models in both MSE and MAE metrics in scenarios involving private data. For example, in the AMPds2 dataset, FRAMU’s superior performance in MSE (0.038) and MAE (4.670) is a testament to its effective federated reinforcement learning approach that respects privacy concerns. The significance of these performance gains is reinforced by the associated p-values.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlearning irrelevant data helps reduce noise and interference from non-contributory data points, enhancing model accuracy and prediction. FRAMU showed exceptional performance in unlearning irrelevant data, recording the lowest MSE and MAE values across all datasets in comparison to the baseline models. For instance, in the AMPds2 dataset, FRAMU’s MSE of 0.033 and MAE of 5.600 surpassed other models. The low p-values validate FRAMU’s significant advantage in discarding irrelevant data.</p>

<div id="S6.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the multimodality experiment, the FRAMU framework demonstrated its capability to handle diverse data types, including images, text, and sensor data. The aim was to assess FRAMU’s effectiveness in unlearning outdated, private, and irrelevant data in a multimodal context. For this, we utilized benchmark datasets like MIMIC-CXR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, NYPD Complaint Data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, and SHED <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. The key focus was on evaluating error reduction and performance improvements in comparison to baseline models, with p-values highlighting the statistical significance of FRAMU’s advancements.</p>

<p id="S6.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we proposed an efficient unlearning algorithm within FRAMU that showcased fast convergence. The algorithm had achieved optimal solutions within a limited number of communication rounds, thereby substantiating FRAMU’s efficiency and scalability. The convergence analysis of FRAMU, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI-F Convergence Analysis ‣ VI Experimental Setup and Results Analysis ‣ FRAMU: Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, evaluated its performance over multiple communication rounds using MSE and MAE metrics across three types of data: outdated, private, and irrelevant. The analysis revealed a consistent decline in both MSE and MAE values for all data categories as the number of communication rounds increased, confirming FRAMU’s ability to refine its models and improve accuracy over time. Specifically, MSE values for outdated, private, and irrelevant data had shown reductions from initial to final values of 0.053 to 0.039, 0.044 to 0.030, and 0.039 to 0.025, respectively. Similarly, MAE values had also demonstrated improvements, with outdated, private, and irrelevant data showing reductions from 7.201 to 4.845, 7.17 to 4.409, and 6.75 to 4.210, respectively.</p>

<div id="S6.SS6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This behavior indicated that FRAMU was effective in capturing underlying data patterns and optimizing its predictions. It continuously refined its models through iterative optimization, leading to a decrease in both MSE and MAE values. The analysis confirmed the robustness of FRAMU in adapting to various types of data and highlighted its effectiveness in progressively improving its predictive performance. Overall, FRAMU’s strong convergence characteristics across different data categories have demonstrated its versatility and capability in minimizing errors, making it a robust choice for various federated learning applications.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FRAMU framework presented in this study has significant implications for both single-modality and multimodality scenarios within the domain of federated learning. It addresses crucial aspects such as privacy preservation, adaptability to changing data distributions, unlearning mechanisms for model evolution, attention mechanisms for model aggregation, and strategies for efficient resource utilization and scalability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the key achievements of FRAMU is its approach to privacy preservation. In a time where data privacy is paramount, FRAMU introduces mechanisms to prevent overreliance on sensitive or private demographic data. Importantly, this emphasis on privacy does not detract from accuracy. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that FRAMU successfully balances the often conflicting goals of data privacy and model performance, marking a significant milestone in federated learning and paving the way for future research in privacy-preserving algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Adaptability is another strength of FRAMU. Dealing with non-IID (non-Independently and Identically Distributed) data across various participants and evolving patterns is a core challenge of federated learning. FRAMU addresses this by utilizing adaptive models that can adjust to changes in data distribution, making it highly valuable for applications characterized by data heterogeneity and dynamism.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The unlearning mechanisms within FRAMU are also noteworthy. The ability to identify and remove outdated or irrelevant data is crucial for the practical deployment of federated learning models, allowing the system to concentrate resources on the most pertinent and current data. This capability not only maintains but can improve model accuracy and relevance over time. Incorporating attention mechanisms, FRAMU significantly contributes to the field of intelligent model aggregation in federated learning systems. By filtering out noise and focusing on the most informative features during learning and aggregation, FRAMU sets a foundation for the development of more efficient and effective federated learning systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">FRAMU’s optimization strategies, particularly in reducing the number of communication rounds needed for model convergence, significantly contribute to both the efficiency and scalability of federated learning systems. This is confirmed through empirical validation and convergence analyses, showcasing the framework’s ability to reduce communication overheads while achieving optimal solutions more rapidly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p6.1" class="ltx_p">FRAMU represents a major advancement in federated reinforcement learning, particularly in its proficient management and unlearning of various data types. Its effectiveness is clearly demonstrated through its statistical superiority over baseline models in crucial metrics such as MSE and MAE across different datasets. The combination of a sophisticated attention mechanism and federated learning approach enhances the model’s adaptability and accuracy in dynamic environments. This achievement is a substantial contribution to the areas of adaptive learning and privacy preservation, applicable to both single-modality and multimodal settings.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FRAMU framework marks a substantial advancement in Machine Unlearning for both single-modality and multimodality contexts. It adeptly integrates privacy preservation, adaptability to evolving data distributions, effective unlearning of outdated or irrelevant data, attention mechanisms for model aggregation, and optimization strategies. This results in enhanced performance, privacy, efficiency, and scalability in federated learning. Empirical evaluations indicate FRAMU’s superiority in model accuracy, data protection, adaptability, and optimization, outperforming baseline models in metrics like MSE and MAE. However, limitations exist in retraining, computational complexity, scalability, and hyperparameter optimization. Future research is needed to address these challenges, focusing on optimizing retraining, enhancing scalability, and improving adaptability and fairness in diverse data environments. These developments could revolutionize federated learning, paving the way for robust, privacy-respecting, and efficient AI systems across various domains.</p>
