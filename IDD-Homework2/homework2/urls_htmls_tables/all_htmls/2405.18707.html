<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) is a promising paradigm for enabling future intelligent transportation systems by accommodating artificial intelligence (AI) at the vehicular edge computing (VEC) system. Federated learning (FL) stands as one of the fundamental technologies facilitating collaborative model training locally and aggregation, while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle data in VEI. However, traditional FL faces challenges in adapting to vehicle heterogeneity, training large models on resource-constrained vehicles, and remaining susceptible to model weight privacy leakage. Meanwhile, split learning (SL) is proposed as a promising collaborative learning framework which can mitigate the risk of model wights leakage, and release the training workload on vehicles. SL sequentially trains a model between a vehicle and an edge cloud (EC) by dividing the entire model into a vehicle-side model and an EC-side model at a given cut layer. In this work, we combine the advantages of SL and FL to develop an Adaptive Split Federated Learning scheme for Vehicular Edge Computing (ASFV). The ASFV scheme adaptively splits the model and parallelizes the training process, taking into account mobile vehicle selection and resource allocation. Our extensive simulations, conducted on non-independent and identically distributed data, demonstrate that the proposed ASFV solution significantly reduces training latency compared to existing benchmarks, while adapting to network dynamics and vehicles’ mobility.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has become a promising way to improve transportation safety, traffic efficiency, and system autonomy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> as a result of the development of wireless communications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Researchers are increasingly focusing on vehicular edge intelligence (VEI), which is believed to help the development of ITS<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Integrating AI technology into the VEC platform, which offers storage, computing, and network resources, enables the realization of the full potential of VEI<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. To better utilize the large amounts of onboard data, conventional Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated its potential in diverse ITS applications, encompassing object detection, traffic sign classification, congestion prediction, and velocity/acceleration forecasting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, the conventional method of sending raw data to centralized servers for ML raises significant privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and requires large amounts of bandwidth for wireless communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, a privacy-preserving distributed ML framework, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, is widely adopted in modern VEC systems to ensure higher automation levels en route, where moving vehicles need to make swift operational decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In the VEC system comprising connected and autonomous vehicles, FL locally trains the model and centrally aggregates the results. This approach leverages the data and onboard units of vehicles while allowing data processing and storage at Edge Cloud (EC) locations such as Roadside Units (RSUs) or Base Stations (BSs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the advantages of FL in VEC systems, there remain several challenges on fully unlocking the its potential. One of the most significant difficulties is the high heterogeneity among the vehicles/clients involved in training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Another primary concern of FL is how to protect user privacy since sensitive information can still be revealed from model parameters or gradients by a third-party entity or the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, with the development of AI, we have entered the era of large models, which means the data and algorithm are progressively growing in size and complexity. Training complete and large models on resource-constrained vehicles poses a significant challenge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Split Learning (SL), as an emerging collaborative learning framework, facilitates the utilization of distributed vehicular data, reduces the risk of data leakage, and alleviates the training load on vehicles. SL was recently proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> by splitting the ML model (e.g., CNN) into several sub-models (e.g., a few layers of the entire CNN) with the cut layer and distributing them to different entities (e.g., the vehicle-side model at the vehicles or the EC-side model at the EC), which facilitates distributed learning via sharing the smashed data of the cut layer showing in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Adaptive and Parallel Split Federated Learning in Vehicular Edge Computing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The SL workflow mainly involves three main steps. Initially, the vehicle downloads the vehicle-side model and performs forward propagation to update its vehicle-side model, and transmits the processed data to the EC. Subsequently, the EC conducts backward propagation, updating the EC-side model and broadcasting the gradient associated with the cut layer back to vehicles. Every vehicle sequentially repeats the above process until all vehicles are down. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have compared SL and FL with Transfer Learning (TL) and confirmed that the SL solution outperforms the other solutions in terms of accuracy, detection rates, the area under the curve, power consumption, packet delivery ratio, Quality of Experience (QoE) and delay analysis respectively, in the presence of malicious actions in the experienced ITS.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, utilizing the traditional sequential SL directly for VEC systems causing too many communication overload and time delays. A pioneering work called Split Federated Learning (SFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> combines the ideas of SL and FL to parallelize the training process. In this case, SFL not only reduces communication overhead and latency, but also reduces vehicle computing load, which make it more suitable for VEC systems. Different from FL, the research on SL and SFL is still in its infancy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, especially in the area of VEC systems. As most of the existing studies do not incorporate network dynamics, e.g., channel conditions, as well as vehicle computing capabilities, they don’t consider how to obtain the optimal cut layer in real time. Besides, mobile vehicles traverse the range of the EC for varying durations, completing local training becomes challenging when these vehicles exit the current coverage area <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and the continuous movement of vehicles may hinder the timely uploading of local models to the EC, leading to potential delays in SL convergence and a reduction in model aggregation accuracy due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels. Moreover, the energy consumption for local computing is comparable to that for the wireless transmissions on mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In this context, it is of great significance to choose the cut layer to meet the energy and time constraints, and also consider the resource allocation with mobile vehicles.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In 2016, Google proposed FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and since then, it has become one of the most popular distributed learning methods. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to enhancing the performance of FL from various research perspectives. Some research papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> explore the design of a multi-tier FL framework to effectively accommodate a substantial number of devices with a wider coverage range. To enhance the longevity of resource-constrained end devices, compression strategies such as weight quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and gradient quantization<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> are usually used to reduce computational complexity and communication overhead. To facilitate FL over dynamic wireless networks, several pioneering works have recently studied how to jointly optimize FL performance and cost efficiency, including communication efficiency and energy efficiency, in IoT systems. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> jointly optimizes local accuracy, transmit power, data rate, and devices’ computing capacities to minimize FL training time. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> jointly optimize local training batchsize and communication resource allocation to achieve fast training speed while maintaining learning accuracy.

From a communication perspective, SL performs slower than FL due to the relay-based training across multiple clients. Motivated by this, the SFL has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which exploits the parallel model training mechanism in FL and the model splitting structure of SL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> firstly propose a novel distributed learning architecture, a hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) algorithm by reaping the parallel model training mechanism of FL and the model splitting structure of SL. Due to the dynamic communication environment and the development of 6G, the model training time and communication time can be compared, with the latter cut layer costing more training time but less communication time. How to choose cut layers has become particularly important. A pioneering work proposes an online learning algorithm to determine the optimal cut layer to minimize the training latency<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> design a novel SL scheme to reduce the training latency, named Cluster-based Parallel SL (CPSL) which conducts model training in a “first-parallel-then-sequential” manner.</p>

Thirdly, the offline selection<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> of split layers is only determined by a split layer, if the subsequent vehicle movement or channel conditions change, cut layer offline selection is very likely not to be the current optimal cut layer. Different from the existing works, we focus on an adaptive and parallel SFL solution with an adaptive model splitting for supporting a large number of vehicles. Furthermore, taking vehicle heterogeneity, network dynamics and vehicle mobility into account, we propose a resource management algorithm to optimize the performance of the proposed solution over wireless networks.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our simulation leverages three distinct image classification datasets: (1) the MNIST dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, comprising images of handwritten digits from ”0” to ”9,” each associated with a corresponding label; (2) the Fashion-MNIST dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, consisting of images representing various clothing items like ”Shirt” and ”Trouser,” also labeled accordingly; and (3) the CIFAR-10 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, containing colored images categorized into classes such as ”Airplane” and ”Automobile.” Each dataset comprises a training set with 50,000 samples for model training and a test set with 10,000 samples for performance evaluation. Notably, data distribution at vehicles is non-IID, which widely exists in practical systems. To capture the heterogeneity among mobile vehicles in these datasets, we impose a constraint where each vehicle retains only three out of the ten possible labels, with sample sizes varying according to a power law as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. We employ different learning rates for each dataset: 1e-5 for MNIST, 2e-6 for Fashion-MNIST, and 5e-6 for CIFAR-10.

So in this simulation, we split the whole model by residual blocks.

Several notable observations emerge from our experiments, conducted under the same mobile vehicle selection strategy as proposed. Notably, our scheme showcases accuracy levels comparable to SL, despite our approach processing data in parallel rather than sequentially. This distinction highlights the outstanding performance of our approach. Specifically, our proposed scheme demonstrates significantly better performance than traditional SFL. Here, SFL2, SFL4, and SFL6 represent traditional SFL with the 2nd, 4th, and 6th cut layers, respectively. Additionally, SL, which splits the model into two parts with the 2nd cut layer, serves as a reference point for comparison.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel low-latency and low-energy split federated learning scheme, namely adaptive split federated learning for vehicular edge computing (ASFV) by introducing adaptive split model and parallel training procedure combining the vehicle selection and resource allocation. By applying our ASFV algorithm in vehicular networks, our results demonstrated it achieved higher learning accuracy than FL and SFL, and less communication time delays and energy consumption. Additionally, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis of the training latency and energy consumption of ASFV. Our simulation results demonstrated it achieved higher learning accuracy than FL and near SL accuracy, and less communication overhead than FL and SL under independent and identically non-IID data.</p>
