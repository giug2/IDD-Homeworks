<p id="id11.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id11.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated Learning (FL) is a novel approach that allows for collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy by leveraging models trained on decentralized devices. However, FL faces challenges due to non-uniformly distributed (non-iid) data across clients, which impacts model performance and its generalization capabilities. To tackle the non-iid issue, recent efforts have utilized the global model as a teaching mechanism for local models. However, our pilot study shows that their effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced data distribution, which induces biases in local models and leads to a <span id="id11.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_inline-quote ltx_outerquote ltx_textquote">‘local forgetting’</span> phenomenon, where the ability of models to generalize degrades over time, particularly for underrepresented classes. This paper introduces FedDistill, a framework enhancing the knowledge transfer from the global model to local models, focusing on the issue of imbalanced class distribution. Specifically, FedDistill employs group distillation, segmenting classes based on their frequency in local datasets to facilitate a focused distillation process to classes with fewer samples. Additionally, FedDistill dissects the global model into a feature extractor and a classifier. This separation empowers local models with more generalized data representation capabilities and ensures more accurate classification across all classes. FedDistill mitigates the adverse effects of data imbalance, ensuring that local models do not forget underrepresented classes but instead become more adept at recognizing and classifying them accurately. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate FedDistill’s effectiveness, surpassing existing baselines in accuracy and convergence speed across several benchmark datasets.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the era of data-driven decision-making, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal technology, enabling collaborative model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. This approach not only enhances user privacy but also facilitates the utilization of decentralized data sources, making it a cornerstone for the next generation of machine learning applications, such as medical image processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, and edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its potential, FL faces critical challenges in achieving uniform model performance and generalization, particularly when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data across different clients. This heterogeneity in data distribution leads to significant disparities in local model performance, as the local objective functions diverge from the global objective, pushing the aggregated global model away from the optimal solution. The non-iid problem is not only theoretical but exists in many real-world applications, potentially compromising the efficacy of FL systems.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate these issues, several strategies have been proposed. Initial attempts focused on enhancing local model training to better align with the global objective. Among these, methods such as parameter sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and characteristics sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> of data have been explored to bridge the gap between local and global models. While these approaches aim to enrich local models with broader insights, they inherently increase communication costs and raise privacy concerns, as they necessitate additional data or metadata exchange across the network. Moreover, some researchers have focused on applying generalization theories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, proposing that enhancing the generalization capability of local models could indirectly address the non-iid challenge. Yet, without direct access to knowledge of the global data distribution, these generalization efforts often fall short, providing limited improvements in overall model performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these limitations, the concept of utilizing the global model as a teaching mechanism for local models has gained attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. This approach leverages the more generalized nature of the global model, aiming to guide local training without the direct exchange of data. However, the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer is markedly reduced in the presence of imbalanced local data distributions. Moreover, initializing local models with the global model’s parameters can inadvertently lead to the loss of generalization ability over time, akin to the forgetting phenomenon observed in continuous learning systems. Given this perspective, we ask:

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This study delves into one of the most significant challenges— the phenomenon of model forgetting in the context of non-iid data distribution. Model forgetting, particularly for local models in an FL setup, is often considered as a degradation in the ability to accurately predict underrepresented classes over time. Our investigation reveals that the core of the forgetting issue is primarily rooted in the skewed distribution of local data, where certain classes are represented by fewer samples than others. Such an imbalance leads to insufficient <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_inline-quote ltx_outerquote ltx_textquote">‘positive feedback’</span> during the training process, meaning that the model does not receive enough reinforcement to accurately learn and retain information about these sparsely represented classes.</p>

The analysis of gradients—specifically, how they change in response to the absence or presence of certain classes—reveals that removing classes leads to significant shifts in the model’s learning focus. This is depicted through divergent gradient updates for class 3 and 9, indicating the model’s <span id="S1.p7.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_inline-quote ltx_outerquote ltx_textquote">‘forgetting’</span> or loss of ability to generalize to those classes that became underrepresented or absent in the training data.</p>

<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">This approach integrates group distillation with a novel decomposition of the global model into a feature extractor and classifier, targeting the root causes of the ’forgetting’ phenomenon in local models. We introduce group distillation, a strategy that segments classes into categories based on their sample abundance in local datasets. This categorization enables a targeted distillation process, where knowledge transfer is customized to bolster the learning of few sample classes, ensuring they receive adequate attention and reinforcement. Furthermore, the global model is decomposed into two components: a feature extractor and a classifier so that local models can learn more effectively from the global knowledge. The feature extractor part of the global model helps local models learn generalized representations of the input data, while the classifier part assists in accurately predicting the class labels. By leveraging the global model as a more effective teacher through group distillation and strategic decomposition, we enable local models to retain their generalization ability over time. This approach mitigates the adverse effects of data imbalance, ensuring that local models do not forget underrepresented classes but instead become more adept at recognizing and classifying them accurately.</p>

Consistency-based methods like FedUFO<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and SCAFFOLD<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> aim to encourage local models to learn client-agnostic features, thereby reducing client drift and improving model consistency across different data distributions. Contrastive learning approaches such as MOON<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> focus on encouraging clients to learn similar features to the global model, fostering a more uniform representation of knowledge across the network.</p>

<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Our contribution to this evolving field includes a novel decomposition of knowledge distillation into three parts: true class, few-sample class, and rich-sample class, directly addressing the challenge of imbalanced data distribution. Furthermore, by decomposing both the global and local models, we apply KD in a manner that effectively prevents drift from the global model to local models, ensuring a more balanced and representative learning process. Notably, our method emphasizes improvements on the local side, without any additional communication overhead and privacy concerns typically associated with global-side enhancements.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The phenomenon of forgetting within local models during Federated Learning (FL) training sessions significantly hampers their ability to generalize, particularly for classes that are underrepresented in their datasets. This subsection delves into the mechanisms contributing to this issue and proposes a novel perspective on mitigating its impact through the strategic use of the global model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Previous investigations have identified client drift, backward transfer (BwT), and unbalanced loss as indicators of forgetting during local training sessions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, these studies fall short of pinpointing the precise mechanism of forgetting induced by non-iid data distributions.

Unlike prior efforts that solely focus on optimizing local models’ generalization abilities or sharing parameters/data characteristics, we propose a method that incorporates class imbalanced data distribution directly into the training process. This involves using the global model to provide targeted guidance to local models, enhancing their ability to retain knowledge of underrepresented classes without introducing additional communication burdens or privacy concerns.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p14.1" class="ltx_p">Our reconceptualization of KL divergence, pivotal to the GD Loss, addresses the prevalent class imbalance issue in FL, ensuring effective knowledge transfer from the global to local models. By ensuring that the distillation process respects and responds to the unique class distribution of each local dataset, we facilitate a more balanced and effective knowledge transfer from global to local models. This strategy not only counteracts the adverse effects of non-iid data on model performance but also significantly enhances the robustness and generalization capabilities of FL systems.</p>

Since the global model can be viewed as a more generalized model compared to local ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, we assume that the feature extractor and the classifier of the global model are also generalized.

<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our observations from the results highlight several key points regarding the efficiency of FedDistill compared to established methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, MOON, and FedNTD. (1) FedDistill significantly outperforms all baseline methods in terms of communication efficiency. It achieves the benchmark top-1 accuracy set by FedAvg with considerably fewer communication rounds across all datasets tested. For instance, on MNIST, FedDistill requires only 16 rounds compared to FedAvg’s 100 rounds, showcasing a drastic reduction in communication needs. (2) The efficiency of FedDistill is particularly pronounced under various levels of non-IID data distribution (<math id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> values). As the non-IID level increases from 0.5 to 0.1, our method demonstrates an increasing advantage in communication efficiency, indicating its robustness and adaptability to different degrees of data heterogeneity. (3) When compared to more recent approaches like FedNTD, FedDistill not only achieves higher accuracy but also requires fewer rounds to do so. This efficiency becomes more significant with more pronounced non-IID distributions, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in handling the challenges posed by skewed data distributions. (4) The communication efficiency of FedDistill suggests that it can significantly reduce the communication cost associated with federated learning. This reduction is critical for real-world applications where bandwidth and communication costs are limiting factors, particularly in environments with constrained resources or high data privacy requirements.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Impact of group distillation loss.</span> The results from the demonstration of group distillation loss’s impact on CIFAR10 accuracy highlight the significant role of each component within the group distillation process and its effectiveness in addressing few-sample class challenges (see Table. <a href="#S4.SS4" title="IV-D Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ FedDistill: Global Model Distillation for Local Model De-Biasing in Non-IID Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-D</span></span></a>). The baseline performance on CIFAR10 is set at a Top-1 accuracy of 67.7%, serving as a benchmark for comparing the influence of incorporating True-Class KD (TC-KD), Few-sample Class KD (FC-KD), and Rich-sample Class KD (RC-KD) components individually and in combination.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The observations from the results are as follows: (1) The inclusion of FC-KD alone leads to a substantial increase in accuracy (+2.33%), indicating its critical role in enhancing learning outcomes for few-sample classes. This suggests that focusing on underrepresented classes through targeted distillation significantly contributes to overall model performance. (2) When TC-KD and FC-KD are combined, there’s a notable improvement (+2.22%) over the baseline, reaffirming the importance of addressing both true-class and few-sample classes simultaneously to achieve a balanced and effective learning strategy. (3) Interestingly, implementing RC-KD alone or in combination with TC-KD results in a decrease in accuracy, suggesting that mere emphasis on well-represented classes may detract from the model’s ability to generalize across the broader class spectrum. (4) The combination of FC-KD with RC-KD without TC-KD also results in an increase in accuracy (+1.44%), highlighting the nuanced interplay between focusing on few-sample and rich-sample classes. This combination potentially mitigates the overemphasis on well-represented classes while still benefiting from the targeted approach towards underrepresented classes.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we identified the primary cause of local model forgetting in non-IID FL as the inadequate positive reinforcement for classes that are underrepresented in local datasets. To address this issue, we introduced the concept of Group Distillation, designed to retain the global model’s knowledge for these few-sample classes within local clients. Additionally, we proposed the decomposition of the global model into a balanced feature extractor and classifier, aiming to counteract the tendency of local models to develop biases due to imbalanced data distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our evaluation shows that our method not only surpasses a range of baseline approaches in various datasets but also demonstrates accelerated convergence. These findings highlight our method’s capacity to enhance the accuracy and generalization of FL models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While our method is fast-convergent, and generic, we acknowledge the complexity of training induced by the additional hyper-parameters. To address this, in the future, we will focus on introducing self-adaptive learning approach.</p>
