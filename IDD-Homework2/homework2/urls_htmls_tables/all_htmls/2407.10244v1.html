<p class="ltx_p" id="id13.id1">There has been a surge in the number and type of AI tools being tested and deployed within both national and local government in the UK, including within the social care sector.
Given the many ongoing and planned future developments, the time is ripe to review and reflect on the state of AI in social care.
We do so by conducting semi-structured interviews with UK-based social work professionals about their experiences and opinions of past and current AI systems.
Our aim is to understand what systems would practitioners like to see developed and how.
We find that all our interviewees had overwhelmingly negative past experiences of technology in social care, unanimous aversion to algorithmic decision systems in particular, but also strong interest in AI applications that could allow them to spend less time on administrative tasks.
In response to our findings, we offer a series of concrete recommendations, which include commitment to participatory design, as well as the necessity of regaining practitioner trust.</p>

In social work, AI-based technologies are being incorporated across the board, including into practitioner decision-making <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jørgensen et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib23" title="">2022</a>; Kawakami et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib24" title="">2022a</a>; Dencik

Adoption is driven by increased demand for efficiency stemming from
unprecedented pressures on budgets, rising citizen demand, and challenges in the recruitment and retention of workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Devlieghere, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib13" title="">2017</a>)</cite>.
At the same time, the social work profession has been shaken by a number of high publicity failures, resulting in a greater
focus on risk reduction,
and the introduction
of more data-based assessments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Devlieghere et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib14" title="">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">A common response is the deployment of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p2.1.1">algorithmic decision systems</em> (ADS), under the promise of increased objectivity, efficiency, and accuracy.
ADS are often promoted as ‘evidence-based’, and
as a route to better care without additional human resources.
However, ADS and other technological deployments have often failed to deliver the advertised benefits, and instead introduced new risks and harms.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Kawakami et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib24" title="">2022a</a>)</cite> show that practitioners can find ADS obstructive rather than helpful, and treat the tool as an adversary.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Cheng et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib4" title="">2022</a>)</cite> then demonstrate that the recommendations of a child welfare screening algorithm show significant racial disparities compared to human decision-makers.</p>

With many ongoing and planned future developments, the time is ripe to review and reflect on the state of AI in social care.
While most prior research focuses on the impacts of specific systems, we take a broader view, aiming to explore practitioners’ experiences, perspectives, and needs.
Our goal is to inform future developments both in terms of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.1">what</span> systems should be developed and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.2">how</span>.</p>

Very broadly, the profession can be broken down into two primary areas: (i) adult social care, and (ii) children and families.
In 2021, Social Work England had 99,191 registered social workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(England, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib17" title="">2022</a>)</cite>. The majority are employed by social care departments run by local authorities but some social workers are employed by other public bodies (e.g. National Health Service (NHS) or the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service), or the voluntary and private sector.</p>

A common thread is the general disregard for the context or the users in development of ADS.
Public sector practitioners have viewed existing ADS deployments as unsuccessful, finding the tools to be a burdensome rather than helpful
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Brown et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib2" title="">2019</a>; Kawakami et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib24" title="">2022a</a>)</cite>.

and focus purely on ADS tools, rather than AI more generally.

was facilitated by BASW, an organisation representing over 22,000 UK social work professionals.
Participants were recruited in two ways.
First, the BASW head of policy and research personally reached out to potential participants based on their sector knowledge, or frontline work experience;
nine of sixteen chose to partake.
Second, an advertisement was shared with all frontline workers via an internal BASW bulletin;
this yielded four additional participants.
The final thirteen recruited participants cover a wide range of specialisations and roles, including frontline social workers from the statutory sector in children and adult services, individuals working in policy or senior management, and qualified social workers currently full-time in academia.
Frontline practitioners spanned both general and specialist areas.

Whilst all participants were familiar with the term ‘AI’, specific understanding of the term and experience of it varied among the different stakeholder groups (academics, policy, and frontline). Unsurprisingly, the academics working in this field were the most knowledgeable and forthcoming with different examples of AI in social care and social work practice, followed closely by policymakers, and then finally the practitioners themselves who appeared to have little exposure to AI in their day-to-day practice.</p>

A particularly interesting one was shared by P4 who currently works on evaluating a grassroots developed technology for child protection social workers.
The application seeks to overcome the modularised siloed nature of the case management process, by creating a shared space that can be used collaboratively by the social worker and families alike.
The aim is to open up communication, increase transparency, and empower families.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.1">In contrast, four of the five practising social workers had little exposure to AI in their day-to-day work.

Another practitioner highlighted <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.1.2">“I’ve never seen an obvious example of a process that’s got AI designed into it”</span> (P3).
One frontline practitioner who did have first-hand experience of AI in social work said <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.1.3">“people have tried to use it for risk management, problem families, problem children”</span>, but also recognised <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.1.4">“I probably have more of an interest and more general awareness than most social workers”</span> (P7).</p>

Frontline workers feel they’ve been sold technology as a solution by the managers before and it hasn’t worked”</span> (P12).
The mistrust has developed from past experiences with deployments of technology, and concerns around <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.2">“who’s steering the conversation? No one is proactively developing best practices”</span> (P2).
P7 considers the sectors move toward digitisation as a fundamental challenge to their role:
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2.1.3">“The way it’s been introduced coincided with a move away from a more social approach to social work, to a more …risk management approach, and the technology was constructed and designed to do that,

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1">Others thought ADS could not handle specific aspects of their decision making.

<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.1">“[W]hen you make an assessment like that, it draws on information which is really difficult to capture,

and would not <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1.2">“recognise the nuance of a situation”</span> (P4).

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1">Many practitioners view ADS as too reductive:
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.1">“Presumably, any decision-making tool is only as good as the data that goes into it. And—as I mentioned—the data that we’re able to gather is dependent on individuals and on subjective judgements.
…Something might be lost if the input into the decision was only what you’ve managed to capture and write down”</span> (P11).
Doubts about applicability of ADS
in social work due to the reductive nature of data entry were considered in a 2016 report by the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT).
The report highlighted the large number of factors which could be predictive of potential outcomes, and considered how individual cases are likely to be a unique combination of such factors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tupper et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib42" title="">2016</a>)</cite>.

assessment.
The number then forms the basis of the amount of care, monetary-wise, that the person is eligible for, against the Care Act.
Local authorities have been using that
…for a number of years, and those algorithms are built into the case management systems.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p2.1">However, two other practitioners had strong reservations about the use of transcription due to the nonverbal signals that they think make up a large part of their interactions:

That’s quite difficult to capture”</span> (P12).
Both also felt the use of transcription would adversely impact the quality of their conversations:
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p2.1.2">“[K]nowing every word is being noted makes things slightly different,
even if it’s being turned into a sort of summary rather than a transcription afterwards.
For example, small casual conversations become less likely, and I think these can sometimes be really important to my overall interaction with a family, as it’s in those sorts of moments when families chat about something that they probably think is completely irrelevant to our work, but it’s actually helpful for us to understand”</span> (P11).</p>

P7 wanted to

(b) use AI to identify causes of service provision delays.
These insight could help social workers to allocate resources more appropriately, for example, by adding more shifts at specific times and limiting them at others.
Frontline practitioners working in adult social care
explained one of their most pressing questions is <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.1.3">“what is it that really makes for a successful move?”</span> (P7).
P7 wondered whether AI could use historical data to identify factors which may contribute or hinder an effective move for elderly service users.

<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1">“If you don’t know what AI is, then you don’t know what you don’t know.
You don’t know that it’s potentially a thing, a tool, a mechanism to proportionately empower or make someone’s life better”</span> (P2).
For many, this meant more training: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.2">“I think that there should be more in a way of training or literacy around data, or AI, that will help people understand the options.

This digital upskilling should not only be directed at practitioners, but also service users: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.3">“[W]e want to move closer to co-production with the families that we work with.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1">Our interviewees perceive technology as rarely helpful to social workers.
Existing literature similarly found attempts to digitise and automate
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S7.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1">“highly problematic for frontline social workers, particularly in terms of diverting their time, attention, and energy away from direct work with service users”</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Munro, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib30" title="">2011</a>; White et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib48" title="">2009</a>; Gillingham, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib20" title="">2021</a>)</cite>.
Ongoing challenges with data collection were flagged as a core frustration, agreeing with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gillingham (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib20" title="">2021</a>)</cite> who found data capture and entry are perceived as a tax and a form of surveillance.
The amount of time that practitioners spend manually repeating data entry has become disproportionate to the time spent giving care.
The data collected is also not perceived as useful, rendering the effort meaningless.
Similar sentiment extends beyond social work, with frustration over electronic record keeping affecting probation officers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mair
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib27" title="">2006</a>)</cite> and doctors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Khairat et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib26" title="">2020</a>; Gawande, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib18" title="">2018</a>)</cite> alike.

Yet our interviewees detailed numerous failures
largely due to misalignment with the users’ wants, needs, or available resources.
The typical cause is designers’ lack of understanding of frontline social work practice, combined with insufficient involvement of social workers in the design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wagner and
Piccoli, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib46" title="">2007</a>)</cite>.

Moreover, as our interviewees highlighted, practitioners are not the only stakeholders that should be involved in the design process.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Scott et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib39" title="">2022</a>)</cite> ran two workshops to identify the needs of migrant job seekers, so that these could inform the design of Public Employment Services algorithmic systems.
Similarly,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Cowan et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib7" title="">2021</a>)</cite> ran a multi-stakeholder workshop to prioritise innovations for adult social care.

practitioners may

In contrast to the long-standing misconception that social workers’ ‘computer phobia’ is a key cause of the failure of digital technologies in the sector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Neugeboren, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib31" title="">1996</a>)</cite>, our findings indicate that frontline practitioners are happy to embrace new technology in their private lives, and do not have an inherent aversion to innovation.
Instead, negative past experiences have contributed to widespread suspicion of overhyped technological claims, and deep-rooted scepticism around social work’s compatibility with digital technology.
Similar notions have been proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gillingham (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib19" title="">2015</a>)</cite> almost a decade ago;

<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS1.SSS0.Px4.p1.1">As outlined in <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#S2" title="2.

It is therefore significant that our findings reveal no desire for ADS among practitioners.
While past work found dissatisfaction with specific tools <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kawakami et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib25" title="">2022b</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib24" title="">a</a>)</cite>, we find interviewees actually oppose ADS in general.
Strikingly, the agreement on this point was unanimous;
while our sample may not be fully representative,
we have no reason to suspect it was biased in this specific direction.
The reasoning behind these objections is clear:
practitioners felt their work requires contextualisation and nuance unachievable by ADS.
In line with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Brown et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib2" title="">2019</a>; Kawakami et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib24" title="">2022a</a>)</cite>, practitioners thought it impossible
for a model to adequately account for all relevant decision elements, explicit and tacit,
even if some research suggests ADS has the ability to assist social workers’ decision making (e.g., by surfacing relevant information from other cases) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dare and Gambrill, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#bib.bib9" title="">2017</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.SS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS2.p1.1">The design visions of our interviewees all relate to desire to provide better care.
Several suggestions focused on improving auxiliary support which they felt beyond their ability or capacity to provide.
This included better infrastructure for community and peer support, technology to help route direct care requests, and improved access to information regarding available services.
As for assistance for practitioners, most wished for technologies that would allow them to dedicate more time to their carees.
Here, we discuss the most popular suggestions in more detail.
We emphasize that we wanted to give voice to all our interviewees, disregards of their level of experience with AI; the interview was designed to provide adequate support.
While social workers often know their clients well, we stress that the carees and others impacted should be involved in design process.
Such consultations present critical future work.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1">Practitioners stressed they often do not have sufficient time to help individuals find personalised auxiliary support.
Recommender systems are used in various settings to give users personalised recommendations based on their profile and preferences.
It was proposed (§<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.10244v1#S5.SS2.SSS1" title="5.2.1. Finding information ‣ 5.2. Areas where AI could potentially add value ‣ 5.

An automated ‘matching’ service for accessing peer support was also envisioned.
The primary purpose of these visions is to improve the quality and efficiency of upstream care.
A secondary benefit is a time saving for social workers themselves,
who often manage very large caseloads.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1">Frontline practitioners wanted tools that would help lift the burden of administrative tasks such as transcription and data entry, without trying to influence their decision-making.
Currently, practitioners feel data input is not designed in a user-centric way, and they are unable to collect, record, and flag important information.
More flexible data collection, where practitioners have more agency
could be considered.
One suggestion was to use of natural language processing to semi–automatically populate forms and thus help practitioners cut back on their administrative time.
Instead of manually inputting the same information multiple times into different systems or forms,
the system would populate duplicate fields.
Practitioners could then review this information and edit where appropriate.

THEME 2: Where is AI (not) useful ‣ Reimagining AI in Social Work: Practitioner Perspectives on Incorporating Technology in their Practice"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1.5</span></a>), do not align with practitioner needs.
As a result, practitioners may try and ‘game the system’ by inputting the information they know will provide the output they desired, even if it does not reflect reality.
This, in turn, influences data quality and further masks the ways the current system does not cater to certain needs.
To overcome this, one design vision suggested reversing the data capture process.
The first step will be for practitioners to enter the required budget, and the second step enter justification.
The reversal can be implemented only as an option, for practitioners disagree with the suggested budget.
The data can then be used to update the budget-setting model.</p>

Instead of ADS, consider applications that can help social workers with administrative burden,
understanding resource demands, and factors that lead to successful interventions.
Ask participants which tasks are (not) amenable to technological support.
Discussions about where AI should (not) be applied should centre those impacted by the systems, particularly those in the care system and their families.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S8.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.p1.1">As the integration of AI technologies into the UK’s social care sector continues to gain momentum, it is imperative that we look beyond the developer promises,
and consider the opinions of those impacted by the introduction of these technologies.
We conducted thirteen semi-structured interviews, with the goal of understanding the experiences and attitudes to AI among UK social care professionals, and how these shape their views on the development of future systems.
</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S8.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.p2.1">We found practitioners have been largely dissatisfied with technology deployed in social care, particularly with algorithmic decision systems, and the burden introduced by data collection requirements.
Many of these failures were caused by a lack of involvement of practitioners in the design process, resulting in applications that solve no problem relevant to the carers or carees.
While these past experiences engendered general scepticism, there is still significant interest in AI tools that could reduce administrative burdens, and allow practitioners to spend more time helping people in need.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S8.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S8.p3.1">We made several recommendations based on our findings.
First, we advocate for a strong commitment to participatory design, ensuring that the perspectives and needs of practitioners and carees are incorporated throughout the development and deployment.
Second, we recommend a refocus towards applications genuinely supporting and complementing social care professionals, rather than replacing or undermining their expertise.
Lastly, we highlight the importance of transparency, and of addressing wider barriers to successful use of technology, including funding, infrastructure, and data literacy.
Our conclusions were shared with the practitioners and BASW, and we hope they will lead to development of more effective and safe AI systems, helping social care professionals in their unwavering quest to support vulnerable individuals and communities.</p>
