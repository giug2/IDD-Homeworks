<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In cellular networks, resource allocation is usually performed in a centralized way, which brings huge computation complexity to the base station (BS) and high transmission overhead. This paper explores a distributed resource allocation method that aims to maximize energy efficiency (EE) while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) for users. Specifically, in order to address wireless channel conditions, we propose a robust meta federated reinforcement learning (<span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MFRL</span>) framework that allows local users to optimize transmit power and assign channels using locally trained neural network models, so as to offload computational burden from the cloud server to the local users, reducing transmission overhead associated with local channel state information. The BS performs the meta learning procedure to initialize a general global model, enabling rapid adaptation to different environments with improved EE performance. The federated learning technique, based on decentralized reinforcement learning, promotes collaboration and mutual benefits among users. Analysis and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MFRL</span> framework accelerates the reinforcement learning process, decreases transmission overhead, and offloads computation, while outperforming the conventional decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm in terms of convergence speed and EE performance across various scenarios.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The inexorable progression of wireless networks is the trend. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has standardized the access technique and physical channel model for the fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) network, which enables dynamic switching of user equipment (UE) between resource blocks (RBs) possessing varying bandwidths and supports multiple subcarrier spacing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Building upon the foundation established by 5G, the sixth generation (6G) and beyond networks aspire to provide the enhanced and augmented services of 5G NR, while transitioning toward decentralized, fully autonomous, and remarkably flexible user-centric systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. These emerging techniques impose more stringent requirements on decentralized resource allocation methods, emphasizing the significance of optimizing RB assignments to enhance the overall quality of service (QoS) within the systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the fast variations and rapid fluctuations in channel conditions render conventional resource allocation approaches reliant on perfect channel state information (CSI) impractical <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The inherent non-convexity of the resource allocation problem resulting from discrete resource block association necessitates computationally demanding solutions. Furthermore, the coupled variables further exacerbate the complexity of the problem. Traditionally, resource allocation problems have been addressed through matching algorithms executed at the central base station (BS), resulting in substantial computational burdens on the cloud server. All of the aforementioned challenges require a brand-new optimization tool capable of effectively operating in unstable wireless environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) methods, especially deep learning (DL) approaches, have become promising tools to address mathematically intractable and high-computational problems. However, artificial neural networks (NNs) require massive amounts of training data, even for a simple binary classification task. Moreover, the overfitting issue makes artificial NNs hard to adapt and generalize when facing new environments, hence requiring additional data to retrain the models and affecting the training data efficiency. Particularly, the fast channel variations and the flexible network structure in 5G beyond network services restrict the application of conventional ML algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To enable fast and flexible learning, meta learning has been proposed to enable the model to adapt to new tasks with faster convergence speed by taking the input of experience from different training tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. For instance, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is a meta-learning technique that can integrate prior experience and knowledge from the new environment, empowering the models with the ability to generalization and fast adaptation to new tasks. Another way to improve data efficiency is to enable experience sharing among models, which is known as federated learning. By the periodic local model averaging at the cloud BS, federated learning enables the local users, to collectively train a global model using their raw data while keeping these data locally stored on the mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we focus on meta learning enabled federated reinforcement learning, to improve the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithm for resource allocation tasks in wireless communications.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A promising solution to address concerns regarding complexity and signaling cost concerns involves establishing a decentralized framework for resource allocation and extending the intelligent algorithms to encompass cooperative large-scale networks. The adoption of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm presents an opportunity to tackle the challenges associated with complexity and enhance the intelligence of local UEs. MARL algorithms rely solely on real-time local information and observations, thereby significantly reducing communication overhead and latency. Mathematically, MARL can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), where training agents observe the current state of the environment at each step and determine an action based on the current policy. Agents receive corresponding rewards that evaluate the immediate impact of the chosen state-action pair. The policy updates are based on the received rewards and the specific state-action pair, and the environment transitions to a new state subsequently. The application of MARL approaches in wireless communications has been extensive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.

However, local user equipment (UE) cannot directly access global environmental states, and UEs are unaware of the policies adopted by other UEs. Consequently, there is a possibility that UEs may select channels already occupied by other UEs, leading to transmission failures in the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) based schemes.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is noted that the resource block association problem is a discrete optimization problem, which is usually solved by value-based methods, e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, and Deep Q-learning. Meanwhile, the transmit power is the continuous variable, and only policy-based algorithm can deal with the continuous optimization. Hence, how to jointly optimize the transmit power and channel assignment becomes a challenge. In some work, the transmit power is approximated to discrete power levels, and the user can only transmit by these presetting power levels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. However, discrete transmit power with large intervals means performance reduction.On the other hand, the complexity could be very high if the number of power levels is significant. To address these concerns, Yuan <em id="S1.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a framework with a combination of value-based network and policy-based network.

However, in such works the different networks are trained simultaneously, which leads to an unstable framework and makes the NNs hard to be trained and converge.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The primary obstacle faced by MARL algorithms is the instability and unpredictability of actions taken by other user equipment (UEs), resulting in an unstable environment that affects the convergence performance of MARL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Consequently, a partially collaborative MARL structure with communication among UEs becomes necessary. In this structure, each agent can share its reward, RL model parameters, action, and state with other agents. Various collaborative RL algorithms may employ different information-sharing strategies. For instance, some collaborative MARL algorithms require agents to share their state and action information, while others necessitate the sharing of rewards. The training complexity and performance of a collaborative MARL algorithm are influenced by the data size that each agent needs to share. This issue becomes severer when combining neural networks (NN) with reinforcement learning. In a traditional centralized reinforcement algorithm, e.g., deep Q-network (DQN), the environment’s interactive experiences and transitions are stored in the replay memory and utilized to train the DQN model. However, in multi-agent DQN, local observations fail to represent the global environment state, significantly diminishing the effectiveness of the replay memory. Although some solutions have been proposed to enable replay memory for MARL, these approaches lack scalability and fail to strike a suitable balance between signaling costs and performance.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the issue of non-stationarity, it is necessary to ensure the sharing of essential information among UEs, which can be facilitated by federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Federated learning has demonstrated successful applications in tasks such as next-word prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and system-level design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Specifically, federated reinforcement learning (FRL) enables UEs to individually explore the environment while collectively training a global model to benefit from each other’s experiences.

<p id="S1.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another main challenge of the reinforcement learning algorithm is the demand for massive amounts of training data. Since the training data can only be acquired by interacting with the environment, the agent usually needs a long-term learning process until it can learn from a good policy. Moreover, using such a large amount of data to train an agent also may lead to overfitting and restrict the scalability of the trained model. In the scope of the wireless environment, the fast fading channels and unstable user distributions also put forward higher requirements on robustness and generalization ability. Particularly, the previous resource allocation algorithms usually set a fixed number of users, which makes the algorithm lack scalability to various wireless environments in practical implementation.</p>

The meta learning can be implemented in different ways.

<p id="S1.SS2.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another challenge caused by federated learning is the heterogeneity in systems and the non-identical data distributions in RL may slow down or even diverge the convergence of the local model.

Due to the similar mathematical expression, we can combine federated learning and meta learning naturally, so that training and adapting the models from statistically heterogeneous local RL replay memories. The aforementioned studies serve as valuable inspiration for us to explore the application of meta learning and FRL in addressing the challenges of channel assignment and power optimization.

The computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of UEs, and the mobility of UEs causes the variable CSI, which means the high-complexity algorithm needs to be executed frequently, leading to high transmission overhead and high computational pressure to the BS. Moreover, due to the transmission latency, the current optimized resource allocation scheme by the BS may not be optimal for UEs anymore, and a distributed and low complexity resource allocation approach on the UE side is more than desired.</p>

As aforementioned concerns in Section I, it is hard to train different types of neural networks simultaneously. In another way, the discrete assignment problem can be described by different probabilities to choose different subchannels, and then one-dimensional discrete choice can be mapped to high-dimensional probability distributions. Overall, the joint optimization problem can be solved by a simple policy-based framework with a specific output design.</span></p>

Then we will design the NN structure to solve this EE maximization problem, and propose a meta reinforcement learning scheme for the NN initialization. We also demonstrate the meta-training and meta-adapting algorithms in detail. Finally, we will present the federated learning algorithm and procedures. </span></p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The proposed algorithm starts from the meta-training for initializing the global generalized model at the BS. The initial model is meta-trained using the BS data set. After the initial global model is trained, it will be broadcast to the local UEs for adapting to the new environments. During the meta-adapting, i.e., the fine-tuning process, the local models are trained using a local database, i.e., local CSI, and the local models can be reunited as a global model so that the UEs could learn the knowledge from the experiences of other UEs and improve the global EE. One popular way is to average the distributed models and form a global model, which is called federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. After the local models are averaged by the BS, it would be broadcast to the local UEs which will fine-tune the global model and adapt to the local scenarios. This process will be repeated until the meta-adaptation stage finishes. The overall procedure is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III Proposed Meta Federated Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation ‣ Meta Federated Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a></span></p>

As the analysis above, the discrete subchannel association parameter can be described by different probabilities to choose different subchannels, thus the discrete variable can be expressed by probability distributions on subchannels, which is generated by a categorical layer. Meanwhile, continuous power optimization is performed by the Gaussian layer, where the mean and variance of the transmit power can be trained. </span></p>

Specifically, we apply the PPO algorithm because of its ease of use and robustness, which make it the default algorithm by OpenAI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. It is noted that the NN architecture shares parameters between the policy and value function, so that the actor network and critic network share the underlying features in the NN, and simplify the meta learning initialization and model broadcast costs. The corresponding network structure of the local models is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A Neural Network Structure Design ‣ III Proposed Meta Federated Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation ‣ Meta Federated Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Resource Allocation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</span></p>

Particularly, the local model is trained by each UE individually for the <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MFRL</span> algorithm, which limits its application, making it hard to adapt to more complicated practical scenarios. The resource allocation model should have the ability to adapt and generalize to different wireless communication environments with different cluster sizes. Hence, the meta reinforcement learning algorithm can be considered to meet the requirement of the generalization.</p>

The meta-training process takes the experience from different tasks, i.e., the resource allocation for different cluster sizes, to initialize a model which can be adopted by UEs in different scenarios and achieve fast adaptation.

To enable the individual models at each UE can be benefited from other UEs, the federated learning technique can be applied.</p>

Particularly, the meta reward is the sum of the reward of the resource allocation tasks for 2, 4, and 8 UEs in the urban micro scenario. The increase in the meta reward demonstrates the effectiveness of the meta-training. It is also noted that with the meta-training step increasing over 100 episodes, the sum reward keeps stable. This is because the meta-training process is to train a global and generalized model which can be adapted to different tasks, but the performance of the generalized model itself cannot be as well as the models for the specific tasks.</p>

However, the improvement slows down as the number of UEs increases, since the bandwidth of subchannels in the proposed scenario is not equal, and when the number of UEs is less than the subchannels, it would access the subchannel with larger bandwidth for higher EE.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a distributed energy-efficient resource allocation scheme was developed. The system energy efficiency was maximized by jointly optimizing the channel assignment and the transmit power of user equipments. The formulated non-convex problem was solved by the proposed robust meta federated reinforcement learning framework to overcome the challenge of the computational complexity at the base station and the transmission cost by the local data. <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Quantity analysis and numerical results showed that the meta training model has good generalization ability under different scenarios, even if the scenarios and tasks are different. Meanwhile, the combination of federated learning and meta learning with reinforcement learning enables the decentralized algorithm a better performance on convergence and robustness.</span></p>
