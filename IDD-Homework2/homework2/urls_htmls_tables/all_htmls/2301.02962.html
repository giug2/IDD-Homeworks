<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Entity resolution (record linkage or de-duplication) is the process of
identifying and linking duplicate records in databases.
In this paper, we propose a Bayesian graphical approach for entity resolution
that links records to latent entities, where the prior representation on
the linkage structure is exchangeable.
First, we adopt a flexible and tractable set of priors for the linkage
structure, which corresponds to a special class of random partition models.
Second, we propose a more realistic distortion model for categorical/discrete record attributes, which corrects a logical inconsistency with the
standard hit-miss model.
Third, we incorporate hyperpriors to improve flexibility.
Fourth, we employ a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler for inferential
speedups.
Using a selection of private and non-private data sets, we investigate the
impact of our modeling contributions and compare our model with two
alternative Bayesian models.
In addition, we conduct a simulation study for household survey data, where
we vary distortion, duplication rates and data set size.
We find that our model performs more consistently than the alternatives
across a variety of scenarios and typically achieves the highest entity
resolution accuracy (F1 score).
Open source software is available for our proposed methodology, and we
provide a discussion regarding our work and future directions.</p>

responses submitted by the same individual across multiple surveys, even when
unique identifiers such as social security numbers are not recorded.
This paper advances Bayesian methods for entity resolution by: (i) thoroughly
evaluating a general class of priors on links between responses and
individuals, and (ii) proposing a more realistic model for distortions that
appear in individuals’ identifying attributes (name, address, etc.).
Both of these contributions are evaluated independently and jointly on a
variety of data sets, one of which is a longitudinal medical survey.
The results show that the general class of priors – the Ewens-Pitman random
partitions – achieve similar accuracy in three previously studied parameter
regimes, so long as vague hyperpriors are used.
This is an important insight, as it addresses questions in the literature
about which parameter regime (if any) is most suitable for entity resolution.
In addition, the proposed distortion model is found to significantly improve
the accuracy of entity resolution, particularly for string-type attributes.
We provide two simulation studies supporting our work and comparisons.
The paper is complemented by an R package that implements the proposed
model using an optimized partially collapsed Gibbs sampler.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As commonly known in the literature, entity resolution (ER; record linkage or
de-duplication) is the process of taking large, noisy (dirty) databases and
removing duplicate records (often in the absence of a unique identifier)
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Doan et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Elmagarmid et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>; Naumann and Herschel, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Getoor and Machanavajjhala, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Christen, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012a</a>; Christophides et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Ilyas and Chu, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Papadakis et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Binette and Steorts, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.
This problem has become increasingly important in many fields, such as survey
methodology, official statistics, computer science, political science, health
care, human rights, and others.
In this paper, we are motivated by several applications. For example, we
consider a longitudinal health care survey, where information is categorical
in nature due to privacy restrictions on the data set. This may be of interest
to those in the survey methodology community as they may face similar issues.
In addition, we consider categorical and string or textual based data sets (or
surveys) such as bibliographic/citation documents, information from
restaurants, and a traditional benchmark (synthetic) study.
The goal of analyzing multiple data sets is to make the survey community more
aware of data sets that are relevant for entity resolution methods.
Other overarching goals are to extend recent Bayesian graphical ER methodology
for these data sets, provide comparative analyses, simulation studies, and
guidance to researchers.
Moreover, we provide open-source software for the community for our proposed
method and two recently proposed methods in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The idea of entity resolution dates back to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Dunn (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">1946</a>)</cite>, who envisioned
a “book of life” that would piece together information about an individual.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Newcombe et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">1959</a>)</cite> proposed one of the first methods for
performing ER, based on a heuristic statistical test.
This method was later formalized by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fellegi and Sunter (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">1969</a>)</cite>, who
developed a model based on agreement patterns between pairs of records,
and a likelihood ratio test for classifying pairs as <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">linked</em>
(referring to the same entity), <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">possibly linked</em> or <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-linked</em>.
Under some strong assumptions, they showed that their method – now known as
the Fellegi-Sunter (FS) method – is statistically optimal.
The FS method has been advanced over many decades in the ER literature,
especially in survey methodology due to its scalability, ease of use and
simplicity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Winkler, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>; Christen, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012a</a>; Sadinle and Fienberg, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; Enamorado et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
However, it has some inherent limitations: it makes inconsistent (intransitive)
predictions, it does not naturally account for uncertainty, it cannot exploit
patterns at the entity-level, and it is incompatible with generative modeling
approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tancredi and Liseo, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">Some of these limitations can be addressed by adapting the FS method to a
Bayesian setting, while also imposing consistency constraints on the links
between records <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sadinle, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> proposed a Bayesian extension
of the FS model for performing ER within a single database.
It incorporates consistency (transitivity) constraints by requiring that
records are partitioned into groups that are mutually linked.
In addition, the model supports multiple levels of agreement, and incorporates
priors on the links and <math id="S1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">m</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑚</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1c">m</annotation></semantics></math>/<math id="S1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="u" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">u</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝑢</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1c">u</annotation></semantics></math> probabilities (from the FS model).
In contrast with traditional FS methods, quantification of ER uncertainty is
possible by computing the posterior distribution on the links.
However, despite these benefits, the model has not been widely examined in
the literature, perhaps in part due to the lack of a publicly-available
implementation.
One of our goals in this paper is to evaluate Sadinle’s model as a
representative example of a Bayesian FS model, and compare it to another class
of Bayesian entity resolution models, which we now describe.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In parallel to developments in Bayesian FS models, others have proposed a new
class of generative models called Bayesian <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">graphical entity resolution</em>
models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tancredi and Liseo, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Steorts, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Steorts et al., <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>.
In contrast with FS methods, these models do not operate on agreement patterns
between pairs of records.
Instead, they model a latent population of entities and the process by which
records are generated from entities.
They are known as “graphical” models because the fundamental objects in the
model form a bipartite graph – the latent entities correspond to one set of
vertices, the records correspond to another set of vertices, and the links
are edges that connect the vertices.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tancredi and Liseo (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> proposed one of the first models of this kind for performing
ER across two databases.
Subsequently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> proposed an extension to multiple
databases, while optionally allowing for duplicates within each database.
However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> discovered a limitation of the their
model and the model by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tancredi and Liseo (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> – the uniform prior on the linkage
structure is highly informative about the number of entities present in the
data.
They noted that future work ought to consider more appropriate priors on the
linkage structure for ER.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The models by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tancredi and Liseo (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> both assume
entities are described by a set of latent categorical attributes (e.g., date
of birth, gender) which are distorted in the records.
However, their model of the distortion process is simple and is unable to
capture realistic distortions in string-type attributes, such as names.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> addressed this problem by proposing a string
pseudo-likelihood and an empirically-motivated prior in a model known as
<span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span>.
The <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> model was later used as a foundation by
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Marchant et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> for developing more scalable Bayesian graphical
ER techniques.
They proposed an end-to-end method that jointly performs blocking and
ER, where inference can be distributed or parallelized at the block level.
Importantly, this enables propagation of blocking uncertainty to the ER
task.
They observed a 200<math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><times id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math> speed-up, which allowed them to scale
<span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> to a data set containing over one million records.
However, the <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> model uses the same uniform prior on the linkage
structure as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tancredi and Liseo (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, and suffers
from the same limitations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the shortcomings of existing Bayesian graphical ER models, we
propose and evaluate several modeling refinements in this paper.
First, we propose a flexible and tractable set of priors for the linkage
structure that are the Ewens-Pitman (EP) family of random partition models
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pitman, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>.
These are the most general family of priors that satisfy exchangeability (an
elementary requirement) and they are more flexible than the uniform priors
used in previous work.
Second, we incorporate hyperpriors on the EP parameters to further increase
flexibility and reduce the need for tuning.
This is motivated by the informativeness of the uniform prior used in previous
work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Steorts et al., <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>.
Third, we propose a more nuanced distortion model for categorical/discrete attributes, which corrects an inconsistency with the standard
hit-miss model used by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tancredi and Liseo (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>); Steorts et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Steorts (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.
Fourth, we design a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler to fit our model which
incorporates computational optimizations.</p>

Bayesian FS model by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.
We also evaluate our model (and the alternatives) in a controlled simulation
study, where we generate synthetic household survey data, with varying
numbers of records, levels of distortion, and rates of duplication.
Overall, we find our model is more robust across the various scenarios
tested, and it typically achieves superior ER accuracies.
We provide open source software for all of the ER methods under evaluation,
and we provide a discussion of our contributions and directions for future
work.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We review notation and assumptions used throughout the paper.
We assume the data (from one or more sources) is <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">structured</em>, meaning
that it has been standardized using schema alignment techniques.
For the purposes of our paper, the data is represented in a tabular format,
where rows correspond to records and columns correspond to attributes.
This in contrast to <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">unstructured</span> entity resolution, which deals with
textual descriptions (paragraphs) or images.

Since we are working in a Bayesian setting, we seek a full posterior (not
merely a point estimate) over the linkage structure so that uncertainty can be
propagated to post-ER tasks, which may include regression, multiple systems
estimation, among other examples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kaplan et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Tancredi and Liseo, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Steorts et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Tancredi et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Sadinle, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.
While the post-ER task is not a goal of this paper, the previous references
propose recent approaches of such tasks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The linkage structure is the primary variable of interest for entity
resolution, so we pay special attention to it when designing our model.
Since we are working in a Bayesian setting, we must specify a prior on the
linkage structure.
We previously noted that the linkage structure can be interpreted as a
<em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">partition</em> of the records into subsets, where the records in each
subset correspond to the same entity.
This interpretation is convenient, as we can drawn on related work on random
partitions when considering potential priors.
In this section, we review a special class of random partitions called the

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we propose a generative model for entity resolution that
incorporates a latent population of entities, each with a set of unknown
attributes.
Our model employs the Ewens-Pitman class of priors on the linkage structure
and a modified record distortion model that deviates from the common
“hit-miss” model used by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tancredi and Liseo (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>.
We provide an index of the model’s variables and an illustration of their
dependence structure in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Graphical Bayesian ER ‣ Bayesian Graphical Entity Resolution using Exchangeable Random Partition Priors1footnote 11footnote 1 This is a pre-copyedited, author-produced version of an article accepted for publication in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology following peer review.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the absence of prior knowledge, we recommend setting the remaining
hyperparameters to yield vague priors – i.e., priors that provide little
information relative to the experiment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tiao and Box, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">1973</a>; Bernardo and Smith, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>.
We note that there are different views in the Bayesian community about how
to specify vague and/or uninformative priors.
For more on this, we refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Syversveen (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite> and
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Irony and Singpurwalla (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>)</cite>.
Putting aside such debates, our recommendations are as follows:</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To perform entity resolution using our model, we must find the posterior
distribution over the linkage structure conditional on the observed record
attributes and their sources.
Since the posterior is not analytically tractable, we propose an approximate

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">MCMC produces approximate samples from the posterior distribution by
constructing a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution matches the

The samples produced by MCMC are approximate in the sense that they are
autocorrelated, and they may only match the equilibrium (posterior)
distribution asymptotically.
Various algorithms exist within the MCMC framework – we refer the reader

It is a generalization of Gibbs sampling that reduces the extent of
conditioning in the variable updates by collapsing (marginalizing out)
variables and/or updating variables in groups.
This can significantly improve convergence and reduce autocorrelation, so

of the Markov chain is preserved.</p>

There are several well-established methods for dealing with nonconjugacy,
including Metropolis-Hastings algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chib and Greenberg, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>)</cite>,

This approach is considerably more efficient than iterating over all
entities sequentially, so long as the level of distortion is relatively low.
However it is important to note that it relies crucially on <em id="S4.SS3.p2.6.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">not</em>
collapsing the distortion indicators.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this setting the practitioner has access to de-identified data, where
sensitive attributes such as names, addresses, phone numbers,
etc. are removed.
This can make ER quite challenging, as the remaining non-sensitive attributes
may carry limited information about the identity of records.
To study ER in this setting, we use data extracted from the
National Long Term Care Survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Manton, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>, which we refer to
as <span id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">nltcs</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our extract contains de-identified respondent records from the 1982, 1989
and 1994 waves of the survey in the U.S. state of Alabama.
We use all of the available attributes for ER, which include date of birth
(<span id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">DOB_YEAR</span>, <span id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">DOB_MONTH</span>, <span id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">DOB_DAY</span>), registration

Since the data is well-curated, the only distortion that can occur is when a
valid attribute value is replaced by another valid attribute value.
We, therefore, model the attributes as categorical by employing a constant
distance function.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this setting, the practitioner has access to data with sensitive
attributes, such as names.
We assume unique identifiers such as social security numbers are not
available, as ER would otherwise be trivial.
Obtaining real survey data for a non-private setting with ground truth is
challenging, so we use three publicly-available data sets from the
ER literature.
Although these data sets cover other domains, they exhibit characteristics
one would expect to encounter in real survey data.
Namely, we observe the presence of multiple “name-like” attributes, as well
as different levels of variation and distortion.
Below, we provide a brief description of each data set and the attributes used
for ER:</p>

random variables.
We estimate the distribution of the metrics under the posterior using samples
generated via MCMC.
In doing so, we are able to account for posterior uncertainty in our
evaluation.
For each metric, we report a point estimate using the median, along with a
95% equi-tailed credible interval.

Both results demonstrate the benefit of placing hyperpriors on the

<span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">GenCoupon</span>.
These linkage structure priors achieve superior F1 scores compared to
<span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Coupon</span>, where the EP parameters are fixed.

is consistent with this finding, demonstrating that vastly different values
of the EP parameters are inferred for each data set when hyperpriors are
used.
Another interesting observation is the fact that the ER accuracy is
relatively similar among <span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">PY</span>, <span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Ewens</span> and <span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">GenCoupon</span>.
This was unexpected at first, given the three parameter regimes are known
to exhibit distinct asymptotic behavior (see equation <a href="#S2.E1" title="In 2.2 Exchangeable Random Partitions ‣ 2 Background and Notation ‣ Bayesian Graphical Entity Resolution using Exchangeable Random Partition Priors1footnote 11footnote 1 This is a pre-copyedited, author-produced version of an article accepted for publication in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology following peer review. The version of record Marchant, N. G., Rubinstein, B. I. P., and Steorts, R. C.

This suggests all three regimes may be flexible enough to model the
linkage structure of the data sets we consider here.
It would be interesting to see if these observations translate to much larger
data sets, where the asymptotic behavior of the three regimes would become
more apparent.</p>

for this data set.
Our distortion model does not appear to suffer from this problem, as it
requires disagreement between entity and record attributes in order to
classify them as “distorted”.
Since high distortion makes reliable linkage more challenging, we expect
that our distortion model is likely to perform better in practice.
Indeed, it achieves a better balance between precision and recall in
our full results (see Figure <a href="#A4.F7" title="Figure S7 ‣ Appendix D Study of Linkage Structure Priors and the Distortion Model ‣ Bayesian Graphical Entity Resolution using Exchangeable Random Partition Priors1footnote 11footnote 1 This is a pre-copyedited, author-produced version of an article accepted for publication in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology following peer review.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We return to the original goal of this section and summarize what we have
learned in this study.
First, we have learned that our proposed linkage structure prior is generally
more robust due to the use of hyperpriors.
In addition, our inferences are relatively insensitive to the EP parameter
regime, which may be due to the fact that the data sets are relatively small
in size.
This behavior also holds for the <span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> distortion model when combined
with our proposed linkage structure priors.
Second, when studying the performance of the distortion models (<span id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span>
versus our proposed distortion model), we find that ours predicts more
reasonable distortion rates and improves the linkage accuracy as measured
by F1 score.
Thus, based on this study, we would recommend our distortion model and
linkage structure priors moving forward for data sets similar to those
we have considered.
However, we stress that further exploration is needed to provide more
general recommendations for other data sets.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we study how our entity resolution model performs in
comparison with models by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> and
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sadinle, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.
The <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> model by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> is a natural baseline
to consider, as it served as inspiration for our model.
Compared to our model, <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> is less Bayesian in its design, as many
of the parameters are set empirically or arbitrarily.
Both our model and <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span>, are examples of direct modeling approaches
to ER – i.e., they model how the observed records are generated, incorporating
the linkage structure as a latent variable.
In contrast, the model by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> (which we refer to
as <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Sadinle</span>) adopts a comparison-based approach to ER.
Instead of modeling the data directly, it models attribute-level comparisons
between pairs of records, incorporating the presence/absence of a link
between the pair as a latent variable.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> compares direct and comparison-based approaches
from a methodological perspective, however we are not aware of any empirical
comparisons in the literature.
Our goal in this section is to provide a comparison for the first time on a
variety of data sets, where we make no strong claims that our results
generalize to all applications or data sets.</p>

all three models.
For simplicity we only provide results for our model under the
<span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">GenCoupon</span> prior, which is denoted <span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Ours</span> in the table.
Our model achieves the highest (or equal-highest) F1 score for all four
data sets.
We expect the poorer performance of <span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> is due to its use of
subjective (inflexible) priors and its distortion model, which tends to favour
high distortion and over-linkage.
<span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Sadinle</span> achieves the second highest F1 score in the
non-private setting (<span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">RLdata</span>, <span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">cora</span>, <span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">rest</span>),
and the lowest F1 score in the private setting (<span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">nltcs</span>).
The poorer performance for <span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">nltcs</span> may be partly related to the
blocking scheme, which is less aggressive, leaving the model more susceptible
to over-linkage.
Another important factor is the sensitivity of <span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Sadinle</span> to the
truncation points for the priors on the <math id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">m</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑚</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p3.1.m1.1c">m</annotation></semantics></math>-probabilities.

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study provides evidence that our model achieves a better balance

We stress that our results are based on four data sets – further
experimentation is required to determine whether our results generalize
to other data sets and applications.
We speculate that the better performance of our model is mainly due to
improved flexibility resulting from the addition of priors and
hyperpriors, which can be viewed as performing model selection.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct a simulation study to evaluate our model under controlled
conditions, where we vary the size of the data set, the level of distortion,
and the level of duplication.
Due to space constraints, we summarize the study here – full details

We design a simulator for household survey data sets, where responses are
collected for individuals within households.
Since the attributes of individuals within a household are dependent – e.g.,
the address is the same, family members may share the same last name,
the age of individuals may be correlated – the simulated data follows a more
complex generative process than our entity resolution model.
This is intentional, as it allows us to evaluate our model in a more realistic
setting where it is <em id="S5.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">misspecified</em> for the data.
The dataset simulator also incorporates a record generation process which is
misspecified for our model.
Rather than sampling individuals from the population, our data set simulator
iterates over all individuals, randomly deciding whether to include the
individual, and if so, how many distorted records to create.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6 </span>Discussion</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we summarize our contributions and provide a discussion
regarding future work.
We have proposed a Bayesian model for entity resolution that addresses
limitations of previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Steorts et al., <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Steorts, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Marchant et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
Our model can be viewed as performing graphical entity resolution, where
observed records are clustered to (unobserved) latent entities.
To improve upon the scalability of previous work, we designed a partially
collapsed Gibbs sampler with an optimized implementation that can handle data
sets of around 10,000 records.
This allowed us to provide comparisons with models by
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Steorts (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, which was
previously only possible for toy-sized data sets.
We provided comparisons to real and synthetic data sets and a controlled
simulation study.
We observed that our model tends to be less sensitive to changes in the
hyperparameters than competing models for the data sets considered.
Further analysis is required to make more general conclusions beyond the data
sets and simulations considered in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are many potential avenues for future work.
First, it would be of interest to explore scaling for our proposed model and
the model by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.
This could be achieved by designing parallel/distributed inference
algorithms, by investigating more efficient MCMC algorithms, or by resorting
to blocking techniques.
Another area of interest, is exploring more diverse data sets to understand
the strengths and weaknesses of each method in practice.
Although we made recommendations based on four data sets and a simulation
study, more comparisons would help to alleviate any selection bias regarding
data sets and provide guidance to users.
Finally, future work could consider microclustering priors
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Miller et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> to assess their effectiveness compared to
the infinitely-exchangeable linkage structure priors considered here.
This would require modifying the sampling scheme and selecting an appropriate
class of microclustering priors.</p>

<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this appendix, we describe a hybrid distance measure that is useful for
comparing text strings containing multiple tokens (words), where individual
tokens may be subject to distortion.
We use the measure in this paper for comparing name and address attributes
in the <span id="A2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">cora</span> and <span id="A2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">rest</span> data sets

beyond this paper.
Our measure draws inspiration from a hybrid similarity measure proposed by
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Monge and Elkan (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>)</cite>.
However, unlike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">Monge and Elkan</a></cite>, we attempt to match the
tokens in each string while incorporating penalties for tokens that are
“missing” in one of the strings.</p>

<p id="A3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this appendix, we conduct a simulation study to understand how our model
performs in controlled scenarios.
Specifically, we simulate entity resolution data sets where we vary the number
of records, the level of distortion and the level of duplication.
Since our model is generative, we could use it to simulate data, however the
resulting data would have negligible specification error for our model, which
is not realistic.
We therefore simulate data that is purposefully misspecified for our model by
adding additional dependencies between the entities and entity attributes,
and by using a different process to generate records from entities.
We were unable to find an existing data set simulator that generated such
data, so we implemented our own.</p>

describing a population of households.
For brevity, we omit low-level details here and refer the reader to the

Our simulator operates in two stages: in the first stage it generates a
population of households, then in the second stage it iterates over
individuals in all households, generating a random number of distorted records
for each individual.
By generating households rather than individuals in the first stage, we
are able to incorporate additional dependencies between individuals (entities)
that are not present in our ER model (see Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Model Specification ‣ 3 Graphical Bayesian ER ‣ Bayesian Graphical Entity Resolution using Exchangeable Random Partition Priors1footnote 11footnote 1 This is a pre-copyedited, author-produced version of an article accepted for publication in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology following peer review.

<p id="A3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We now describe how households are generated in the first stage.
In our simplified model, a household may be a couple, a single, a couple
or single with children, or a group of unrelated adults.
Individuals within a household are described by the following attributes:
first and last name (first_name and last_name), date of birth (birth_year,
birth_month, birth_day), gender and zipcode.
The zipcode is constrained to be the same for all individuals within a
household, and the first name is conditioned on the gender, however
the other attributes may vary as described below.
Random values for attributes are generated using the Faker Python
library<span id="footnote10" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">10</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">10</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">10</span><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/joke2k/faker" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/joke2k/faker</a></span></span></span>, which attempts
to mimic real-world frequency distributions.
We make the distributions more concentrated for the name and zipcode
attributes to ensure the entities are not too unique (otherwise entity
resolution would be too easy).</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We begin by generating the head(s) of the household, which are a male and
female couple (for simplicity) or a single male or female.
If a couple is generated, they have a high chance of sharing the same
last name and their birth years are likely not too far apart.
Next we randomly decide whether to generate children.
If children are generated, they share the same last name as the head(s) of
the household (the parents) and there is an appropriate gap between their birth
year and their parents’ birth year.
If no children are generated, then we randomly decide whether to generate
unrelated adults who live with the head(s) of household.
The unrelated adults are constrained to be of a similar age as the head(s)
of the household.
When simulating the household composition, we attempt to follow aggregate
statistics from the Current Population Survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(U.S. Census Bureau, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>.</p>

Each record is obtained by copying the entity attributes subject to distortion.
This is done by iterating over the attributes in a random order, and deciding
whether to activate the distortion process with a probability that varies
for each attribute.
The distortion process for birth day, birth month, gender and zipcode
involves drawing a replacement value according to the distribution used
in the first stage.
The distortion process for birth year involves adding discrete Gaussian
noise to the true birth year.
The distortion process for first and last name may proceed in one of three
ways: (1) by making a random typographical error (character insertion,
deletion, substitution or transposition); (2) by replacing the name with a
variant drawn uniformly at random; or (3) by generating a replacement
according to the distribution used in the first stage.
Variant names for (2) are sourced from the WeRelate.org Variant Names

We consider data sets with 1000 and 10000 records in expectation.
The number of records is random and depends on the number of individuals
and the Poisson rate parameter.
Since the Poisson rate parameter is fixed (see below), we control the
number of records by varying the number of individuals generated in the
first stage.</p>

We now make several observations about the results.</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.SS2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">First, we observe that our model and <span id="A3.SS2.p3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> perform similarly when the
duplication level is medium, high or very high.
For these duplication levels, <span id="A3.SS2.p3.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> has a slight advantage in terms of
recall when the distortion level is high.
The largest difference is observed for the medium duplication/high
distortion scenario, where the recall for <span id="A3.SS2.p3.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> is roughly 10
percentage points higher than for our model.
This difference is due to the priors placed on the concentration parameters

This corresponds to a prior belief that distortions occur in the same way,
rather than in multiple different ways.
However, this is not true for distortions in the simulated data – e.g., an

Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Study of Linkage Structure Priors and Distortion Model ‣ 5 Model Comparisons ‣ Bayesian Graphical Entity Resolution using Exchangeable Random Partition Priors1footnote 11footnote 1 This is a pre-copyedited, author-produced version of an article accepted for publication in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology following peer review.

The <span id="A4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> distortion model is susceptible to
entering a high distortion mode, particularly for attributes with
non-constant distance measures.
This is because it allows a record attribute value to be marked as
“distorted” even if it is not actually distorted.
Our model corrects this inconsistency, and in doing so appears to
be more robust.
In general, we expect the <span id="A4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">blink</span> distortion model to result in
<em id="A4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">over-linkage</em> (high recall, low precision), while our model is

<p id="A6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our aim in this appendix is to determine reasonable values for the
hyperparameters in the entity resolution model by
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, which we refer to as <span id="A6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Sadinle</span>.
We assume the distance functions (used to compare attributes) and agreement
levels (mappings from real-valued distances to discrete levels) are fixed,
and that flat priors are used, as recommended by Sadinle.
Given these assumptions, the only hyperparameters that remain unspecified
are the lower truncation points for the <math id="A6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m" display="inline"><semantics id="A6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="A6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="A6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">m</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="A6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑚</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A6.p1.1.m1.1c">m</annotation></semantics></math>-probabilities.</p>

Consequently, the model has a tendency to “over-link”—linking records
that do not refer to the same entity.
Understanding why the model exhibits this behavior would require further
exploration and is beyond the scope of this paper.
However, we speculate that it may be related to the use of flat priors, or
known stability issues with Fellegi-Sunter-type models

We present Geweke diagnostic plots and trace plots for a selection of model
variables for each data set, linkage structure prior and distortion model.
Each pair of plots is preceded by a title of the form “Data set — Linkage
structure prior — Distortion model”.
The Geweke diagnostic plot (on the left) depicts a Z-score on the x-axis for

We present Geweke diagnostic plots and trace plots for a selection of model
variables for each data set and model.
Each pair of plots is preceded by a title of the form “Data set — Model”.
The Geweke diagnostic plot (on the left) depicts a Z-score on the x-axis
for each variable on the y-axis.
The Z-score tests for equality of the means of the first 10% and final 50% of
the Markov chain, and is typically expected to be in the range <math id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="[-2,2]" display="inline"><semantics id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.2" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml">[</mo><mrow id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml"><mo id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1a" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.cmml">2</mn></mrow><mo id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.3" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml">,</mo><mn id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">2</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.4" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml">]</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2b"><interval closure="closed" id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1"><apply id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1"><minus id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1"></minus><cn type="integer" id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.1.1.2">2</cn></apply><cn type="integer" id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">2</cn></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A7.SS2.p1.1.m1.2c">[-2,2]</annotation></semantics></math>
