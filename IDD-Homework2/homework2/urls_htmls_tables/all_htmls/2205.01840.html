<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of federated learning is to enable multiple clients to jointly train a machine learning model without sharing data. However, the existing methods for training an image segmentation model have been based on an unrealistic assumption that the training set for each local client is annotated in a similar fashion and thus follows the same image supervision level. To relax this assumption, in this work, we propose a label-agnostic unified federated learning framework, named FedMix, for medical image segmentation based on mixed image labels.
In FedMix, each client updates the federated model by integrating and effectively making use of all available labeled data ranging from strong pixel-level labels, weak bounding box labels, to weakest image-level class labels. Based on these local models, we further propose an adaptive weight assignment procedure across local clients, where each client learns an aggregation weight during the global model update.
Compared to the existing methods, FedMix not only breaks through the constraint of a single level of image supervision, but also can dynamically adjust the aggregation weight of each local client, achieving rich yet discriminative feature representations. To evaluate its effectiveness, experiments have been carried out on two challenging medical image segmentation tasks, <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., breast tumor segmentation and skin lesion segmentation.

For example, for a fully-supervised semantic segmentation model, the ideal scenario is that we can collect the pixel-level annotated images as much as possible from diverse sources.

As the expert knowledge usually required for annotating medical images is much more demanding and difficult to obtain, various medical institutions have very limited strong pixel-level annotated images and most available images are unlabeled or weakly-annotated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to the timely emergence of Federated Learning (FL), which aims to enable multiple clients to jointly train a machine learning model without sharing data, the problem of data privacy being breached can be alleviated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. FL has gained significant attention in the medical imaging community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, due to the obvious reason that medical images often contain some personal information. During the training process of a standard FL model, each local client first downloads the federated model from a server and updates the model locally. Then, the locally-trained model parameters of each client are sent back to the server. Finally, all clients’ model parameters are aggregated to update the global federated model. Most of the existing FL frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> require that the data used for training by each local client needs to follow the same level of labels, <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>.<span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>., pixel-level labels (as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedMix: Mixed Supervised Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (d)) for an image semantic segmentation model, which limits the model learning ability. Although, some semi-supervised federated learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> attempt to utilize the unlabeled data in addition to pixel-level labeled images in training, they do not make any use of the weakly-labeled images (<span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>.<span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>., image-level class labels in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedMix: Mixed Supervised Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b) and bounding box labels in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedMix: Mixed Supervised Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (c)), which are invaluable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Clients participating in FL may have different labeling budgets. Therefore, there may be a wide range of inter-client variations in label availability. Weak labels are easier to acquire and thus more broadly available compared to pixel-level ones. In practice, there is a wide range of weak labels with varying strengths and acquisition costs. While an image-level label indicating whether a breast ultrasound image is cancerous or not is easier to acquire compared to a bounding box label pointing out the specific location of the cancerous region, it is also less informative. Therefore, effectively utilizing the information from these weakly-labeled data with varying levels of label strengths as well as unlabeled data, especially for clients without pixel-level labeled data would be highly beneficial for improving the federated model’s robustness while preventing training instability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedMix: Mixed Supervised Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we propose a label-agnostic Mixed Supervised Federated Learning (FedMix) framework, which is a unified FL model making use of data labeled in any form for medical image segmentation. Specifically, in the absence of pixel-level labels, FedMix first effectively utilizes unlabeled images as well as useful information contained in the weakly-labeled images (<span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., image-level class labels and bounding box labels) for producing and selecting high-quality pseudo labels. Through an iterative process, the accuracy of selected pseudo labels which are then used for local training on the client sides improves, leading to better model performance.
To further improve the model robustness, FedMix takes into account the variability of local clients’ available labels through an adaptive aggregation procedure for updating the global federated model. Compared to the existing methods, FedMix not only breaks through the constraint of a single type of labels, but also can dynamically assign an optimized aggregation weight to each local client. Experimental results on two challenging segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FedMix on learning from mixed supervisions, which is valuable in the clinical setting.

In the past years, FL has drawn great attention from the medical image communities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and has been validated for multi-site functional magnetic resonance imaging classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, health tracking through wearables <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, COVID-19 screening and lesion detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, and brain tumor segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In clinical practice, different clients may have great variations in data quality, quantity, and supervision availability.
Improper use of these data may lead to significant performance degradation among different clients. To reduce the inter-client variations, FL has been combined with domain adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, contrastive learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> and knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> to learn a more generalizable federated model. However, existing works do not consider the variation in supervision availability (<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., different clients have different levels of image labels), which is often observed in clinical practice. In our work, we use all the available image label information including image-level class labels, bounding box labels, and pixel-level labels to train a medical image segmentation model and propose a mixed supervised FL framework.</p>

However, training a fully-supervised deep model for image semantic segmentation often requires access to a mass of pixel-level supervisions, which are expensive to acquire <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In particular, the problem of the expensive pixel-level supervision is much more obstructive for medical image segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. To this end, efforts have been made to explore the use of some easily obtained image supervisions (<span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>.<span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>., scribbles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, image-level classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, bounding boxes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and even unlabeled image<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>) to train a pixel-level image segmentation model. However, most of the existing works are based on only one or two types of image supervisions, which greatly limits the model learning efficiency. In most cases, access to some pixel-level annotated data is required to facilitate model training, which may not always be available for each participating client. In our work, we carefully use image-level class labels, bounding box labels, and pixel-level labels to train local clients and propose an adaptive weight assignment procedure across clients for medical image segmentation.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p2.7" class="ltx_p">To integrate various levels of image labels, in our work, we modify the bounding box labels and image-level class labels to pixel-level labels. Specifically, the bounding box point representation is converted into pixel-level label where the foreground class falls inside the bounding box and the background class falls outside the bounding box. For image-level class labels, we constrain the pixel-level label to the corresponding image class.

In the mixed supervised setting, relying only on data quantity for weight assignment is sub-optimal. Thus, supervision availability of each client should also be taken into account during the aggregation process. To this end, we propose to utilize the client-specific training loss to infer the data quality. Each client’s training loss not only provides a more objective measurement of its importance during FedMix optimization but also prevents the federated model from relying on the over-fitting clients.

According to Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.3 Results on Breast Tumor Segmentation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedMix: Mixed Supervised Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, LL on C3 produces quite a few false positives on C2, indicating poor generalization capability due to limited training data.
Under the semi-supervised setting, though the unlabeled data of C1 and C2 is used for training, the segmentation results of FedST are close to those of LL as learning from incorrect pseudo labels is not helpful and may be detrimental. Comparatively, FedMix can utilize the useful information in unlabeled data and the model generates predictions close to the experts’ annotations.

The utilization of adaptive aggregation in federated learning is beneficial even under the fully-supervised setting. Adaptively aggregated federated model can better capture the boundaries and shapes of the tumor regions and contain fewer false positives compared to the model learned using FedAvg.</p>

The locally-learned (LL) model on C3 does not perform well on C1 and C2, observed through the significant performance degradation which indicates severe inter-client variations between {C3, C4} and {C1, C2}. As a result, the pseudo labels on {C1, C2} generated by the model trained on C3 may be inaccurate, utilizing which for training would be harmful. Instead of using all the pseudo labels, FedST makes use of only confident predictions. While the model learned through FedST has an average of 0.56% increase in DC compared to LL, it performs worse on C3, <span id="S4.SS4.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S4.SS4.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., 0.55% decrease in DC. The performance drop may disincentive C3 to participate in the federation thus hindering the deployment of FedST. With dynamic sample selection and adaptive aggregation, FedMix manages to select high-quality unlabeled data and more accurate pseudo labels for training, thus improving the segmentation performance on C3. Additionally, compared to LL, both C1 and C2 obtain significant performance improvements with an average increase of 6.00% and 8.87% in DC respectively. In general, FedMix achieves better overall performance, resulting in an average increase of 3.14% in DC compared to FedST.</p>

Incorporating bounding box labels for training improves the pseudo labels’ accuracy. Consequently, the segmentation performance of FedMix is further improved by 6.11%, approaching the performance of FedAvg under the fully-supervised setting. Bounding box labels are much easier to obtain than pixel-level labels, making FedMix more valuable in clinical scenarios. We further conduct a comparison between FedAvg and adaptive aggregation under the fully-supervised setting, presented in Table <a href="#S4.T10" title="Table 10 ‣ 4.4 Results on Skin Lesion Segmentation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedMix: Mixed Supervised Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>.

Qualitative results of skin lesion segmentation are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Results on Skin Lesion Segmentation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedMix: Mixed Supervised Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Consistent with the quantitative results, the segmentation maps on C1 and C2, produced by the locally-learned model on C3, are inaccurate, due to large inter-client variations between {C1, C2} and {C3, C4}. While the segmentation maps produced by FedST are slightly more accurate compared to LL, learning from confident pseudo labels is insufficient to train a generalizable model, shown through the inaccurate segmentation maps produced by FedST on C1 and C2. Under the same supervision setting, FedMix produces more accurate segmentation maps by dynamically selecting the high-quality pseudo labels for training. Given stronger supervisions, <span id="S4.SS4.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>.<span id="S4.SS4.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>., bounding box labels, FedMix improves the segmentation quality, especially on tumor shape preservation. Through the comparison under the fully-supervised setting, we observe that the segmentation maps produced by adaptive aggregation contain fewer false negatives and have better shape consistencies with manual annotations compared to FedAvg.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare adaptive aggregation with FedAvg and present the results in Table <a href="#S5.T13" title="Table 13 ‣ 5.1 Effectiveness of Dynamic Sample Selection ‣ 5 Ablation Studies ‣ FedMix: Mixed Supervised Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>. For breast tumor segmentation, adaptive aggregation consistently improves performance across clients, with an average of 1.00% increase in DC compared to FedAvg. For skin lesion segmentation, due to the inter-client variations between {C1, C2} and {C3, C4}, adaptive aggregation focuses more on minimizing the training losses on C1 and C2. As a result, the average DC increase of {C1, C2} is 1.44% while the corresponding increase on C4 is limited to 0.19%. Overall, adaptive aggregation outperforms FedAvg.
Till now, aggregation weight optimization in federated learning is still an open problem and should be further explored in the future.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedMix is the first federated learning framework that makes effective use of different levels of labels on each client for medical image segmentation. In FedMix, we first generate pseudo labels from clients and use supervision-specific refinement strategies to improve the accuracy and quality of pseudo labels. Then the high-quality data of each client is selected through dynamic sample selection for local model updates. To better update the federated model, FedMix utilizes an adaptive aggregation function to adjust the weights of clients according to both data quantity and data quality. Experimental results on two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FedMix on learning from various supervisions, which is valuable to reduce the annotation burden of medical experts. In the semi-supervised federated setting, FedMix outperforms the state-of-the-art approach FedST. Compared to FedAvg, the proposed adaptive aggregation function achieves consistent performance improvements on the two tasks under the fully-supervised setting. We believe the methods proposed in FedMix are widely-applicable in FL for medical image analysis beyond mixed supervisions.</p>
