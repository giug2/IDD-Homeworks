   Abstract
  </h6>
  <p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">
   Wargames are a powerful tool for understanding and rehearsing real-world decision making. Automated play of wargames using artificial intelligence (AI) enables possibilities beyond those of human-conducted games, such as playing the game many times over to see a range of possible outcomes. There are two categories of wargames: quantitative games, with discrete types of moves, and qualitative games, which revolve around open-ended responses. Historically, automation efforts have focused on quantitative games, but large language models (LLMs) make it possible to automate qualitative wargames. We introduce “Snow Globe,” an LLM-powered multi-agent system for playing qualitative wargames. With Snow Globe, every stage of a text-based qualitative wargame from scenario preparation to post-game analysis can be optionally carried out by AI, humans, or a combination thereof. We describe its software architecture conceptually and release an open-source implementation alongside this publication. As case studies, we simulate a tabletop exercise about an AI incident response and a political wargame about a geopolitical crisis. We discuss potential applications of the approach and how it fits into the broader wargaming ecosystem.

     For the purpose of automating a wargame, however, the most important distinction is not why the game is played, but rather how it is played. In terms of game mechanics, there are two broad categories of wargame. In a “quantitative” wargame, there are discrete options for the kinds of things each player can do on their turn, and the rules of the game dictate the consequences of those options. A “qualitative” wargame, on the other hand, is much more open-ended. Each player on their turn verbally describes what they would do in that situation, and anything possible in real life is a valid response. If the flow of the game depends on previous player decisions, the moderator adjudicates the outcome for that purpose. For example, most tabletop exercises (also known as seminar games) are qualitative games, as are the political-military wargames that grew out of the work of the RAND Corporation’s Social Sciences Division (SSD) during the Cold War

     There are benefits to having humans play wargames, with the chief benefit being the educational value for the humans involved. However, there are also benefits to being able to automate the playing of wargames. One such benefit is the ability to play the game many times over, elucidating a full spectrum of possible outcomes. Another benefit of automation is the ability to help humans play the game better. For example, an AI could play along with human players, offering suggestions along the way. Such considerations motivate the development of automated wargames, in which an automated system makes the moves instead of human players. (Note that a fully automated wargame should technically be described as a “simulated wargame,” as it’s not a true wargame in the absence of human players, a semantic distinction with which we will not be overly concerned in this text.)

     For quantitative wargames, there is an extensive body of work about automating these types of games. To begin, very simple quantitative wargames may be especially amenable to analysis with game theory. This approach can sometimes shed light on counterintuitive aspects of effective strategies

     In more realistic and hence more complicated quantitative wargames, automation can be done via computer simulation of the game and its players. A notable early example of a wargame simulation was the RAND Strategy Assessment System (RSAS) in the 1980s, which accommodated human players as well as AI players implemented as expert systems

     Given that game theory and the existing simulation literature provide many tools for automating quantitative wargames, what is the equivalent approach for qualitative wargames? In other words, how can we automate an open-ended wargame? This problem has gone largely unaddressed in the literature because until recently it was intractable. A solution requires generating textual output based on reasoning from textual input in the absence of task-specific training data. Such a capability has only recently become available with the introduction of large language models

     . In the next section, we describe an approach to leveraging LLMs to play qualitative wargames. To keep the scope of this effort reasonable, we limit our focus to simulation of qualitative wargames that are entirely text-based. This circumscribed problem space nevertheless spans a wide range of qualitative wargames, ranging from structurally simple games (like

     ). However, this scope does exclude games where exact positions on a complicated game map play an important role (like

    In Snow Globe, there are three types of agents: control, players, and teams. Of these, the control and players are LLM-powered intelligent agents which carry out the traditional human roles of a wargame. The control is the game’s moderator. Its job includes purely logistical tasks, like calling the teams/players to get their responses, as well as complex AI-driven tasks, like adjudicating each round of an adversarial game via LLM. Player agents simulate the responses of humans playing the game, and each can be optionally given a “persona,” a written description of their perspective that influences their responses. Finally, a team agent simulates a group that must jointly formulate a response. A simulation generally has only one control but can have any number of players and teams. Any acyclic arrangement of teams/players is allowed, including a team of teams, a player who’s on multiple teams, etc. This is illustrated in Figure

    <p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p1.1">
     In Snow Globe, the record of what’s happened so far in a wargame simulation is recorded in a “history” object. A history object is an ordered list of text entries, each associated with an agent. For games without information asymmetry, there is a common history maintained by the control. Information asymmetry can be introduced by giving each player/team their own possibly incomplete history object. The game record contained in a history object provides the context in which players make their responses. Formally, the history object(s) constitute the environment of the multi-agent system.

     Looking more closely at the different types of agents, the main task of players is to state how they would respond to each situation presented to them. The prompt sent to a player’s underlying LLM for this purpose includes the history described above, the written description of the player’s persona, and the query, “What action or actions do you take in response?” (Specific questions can also be substituted for that general-purpose one.) The players’ personas affect what they emphasize in their answers. For example, we’ve developed an information technology tabletop exercise simulation that includes players with “data scientist” and “lawyer” personas. The former is more likely than the latter to raise concerns about training data, while the latter is more likely to mention legal compliance.

     A team, from the control’s point of view, looks like just a player – it receives the current history and sends back a response. However, a team has no generative capacity of its own. Behind the scenes, the team asks each team member for their response, then asks a designated team leader player to combine those answers into a single joint response that’s sent back on behalf of the team.

     The control, given its job as the game’s moderator, has many tasks. One control task is to adjudicate adversarial wargames. For this, the control calls each player to find out what actions they propose in response to the current situation. The control then generates a plausible narrative of the outcome, describing what could reasonably happen as the players’ stated plans are carried out. Adjudication is further discussed in the next paragraph. The control can also help create the wargame by generating a situation based on a short prompt, identifying key players in that situation (for which player agents can be created), and generating relevant “injects” (pre-written plot developments used to drive the game). Finally, the control provides tools to analyze the game as it is played or after it’s completed. The control can answer preset questions about the game, or a user can converse with it through a chatbot dialog. In either case, the control draws on the game’s history to answer questions. Questions can range from specific (e.g., “Was a lawyer consulted at any point?”) to general (e.g., “What lesson can we learn from this scenario?”).

     Adjudication is perhaps the most challenging task when implementing qualitative wargames with LLMs. It requires the LLM to create a narrative with a logical sense of cause and effect, which may necessitate developing a plausible resolution when players are acting at cross-purposes. We use the query, “Weave these plans into a cohesive narrative of what happens in the next month,” modifying the time step as appropriate. In a realistic game, not everything important that happens is the result of a player setting out to make it happen. For example, in a political-military wargame, there can be fast-moving developments on the ground that no leader ordered yet are central to the outcome (civil disturbance, terrorism, etc.). To be useful, AI adjudication must be able to generate “nature,” as these contextually plausible outside developments are called

     . This difficult task turns out to be surprisingly easy with LLMs. All that’s required is to modify the prompt by adding a three-word sentence: “Include unexpected consequences.”

     When adjudication does give low-quality results, the most common problems include repeated output from move to move and output that deviates from players’ stated plans (usually by hallucinating new player plans as part of the output). However, a hypothetical hallucination-free LLM would create more problems than it solves. Hallucination, which in other applications is so often harmful, is the key to making open-ended LLM wargames work. The well-grounded creativity required to generate plans and adjudicate their outcomes is hallucination by another name.

     After importing the Python module, users can create control, team, and player agents, as well as history and LLM objects. A recommended approach is to create a child class of the module’s control class, to serve as the control for the user’s specific simulation. The constructor and call methods of that child class can then be overridden with code to create the other agents and run the simulation, respectively.

     The software is configured so that LLM output is randomized, with the result that no two runs of a simulated wargame produce identical results. Because the outcome of any complicated real-world situation hinges on many small details, not all of them characterized and furnished in a simulation, it is not reasonable to expect the simulation to produce a single “correct” answer. (This is a characteristic of qualitative wargames generally that our system implementation mimics.) Instead, repeated iterations of the same simulation with randomized LLM output show a range of possible outcomes. An example of this is given below in Section

     Snow Globe makes it possible for any player agent to be operated by an actual human instead of an LLM. A human player uses a computer connected to the network where the simulation is running, and a web-based user interface tells the player the state of the game by displaying the prompts that otherwise would have been sent to the LLM. The web page receives the human’s written response to each prompt and sends it back to the server.

     Any combination of AI and human players is supported, which permits a range of wargame possibilities. For example, a human player could face an AI adversary. Alternately, a human player could have a staff of AI assistants, each offering their input about what they think the human should do. (The latter case could be implemented using a team agent with AI team members and a human team leader. The assistants could all have different personas or even use different LLMs.) It’s also possible to have a human moderator by setting the control agent to use the web-based user interface.

     When multiple players must respond to the same situation (each without knowing the others’ responses), an issue of timing arises. AI players should generate their responses sequentially to avoid overburdening the hardware. Human players, however, should be able to work on their answers in parallel to avoid unnecessary waiting. In short, AI is compute-bound and humans are I/O bound. We use asynchronous programming to optimize both without requiring code refactoring to switch between AI and human players.

One could design a new web page to communicate with the existing API or forgo the API and design new software to interact with the files directly, with no required changes to the underlying simulation code in either case.

In each move of the game, both players state their plans (without knowing the other player’s plans), and then the result is adjudicated by the control. The number of moves is set in advance. Table

   Conclusion
  </h2>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p1">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">
    Large language models make possible a new kind of simulated wargame. With LLMs, qualitative wargames can be automated, something that was previously only possible for quantitative wargames. AI, like humans, can now engage with open-ended games in which actions and outcomes are not
    <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p1.1.1">
     a priori
    </em>
    limited by the game’s design.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p2">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p2.1">
    In this paper, we have discussed where automated qualitative wargames fit into the broader wargaming ecosystem. We have described a flexible software architecture for LLM-powered text-based qualitative wargames. In addition to a conceptual description, we also release a Python implementation. Examples of a tabletop exercise and a political wargame demonstrate the method’s utility.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p3">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p3.1">
    With LLM-based wargame automation, the same software can be redirected to new problems with ease. As a historical comparison, a progress report on the RSAS automated wargame predicted that building fewer than half a dozen escalation models (effectively, personas) from sources such as “unstructured prose description” would be “both painful and interesting” and would “occupy [the authors] through most of 1984”
    <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">
     [
     <a class="ltx_ref" href="#bib.bib3" title="">
      3
     </a>
     ]
    </cite>
    . Contrast that with Snow Globe, where the prose description is furnished directly to the software for immediate use. Although RSAS could explore its specific problem domain (“large-scale conflicts”) in much greater detail than Snow Globe, the latter can address challenges across many domains, even something as unrelated as a misfunctioning robot (Table
    <a class="ltx_ref" href="#Ax1.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Appendix ‣ Open-Ended Wargames with Large Language Models">
     <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">
      3
     </span>
    </a>
    ). LLMs enable rapid adaptability and a wide scope of applications.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p4">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p4.1">
    An equally important advantage of LLMs is allowing unconstrained moves from players, both AI and human, and unconstrained developments introduced during adjudication. In theory, an ideal LLM-based qualitative wargame simulation is restricted only by what’s plausible, not by what the simulation writer had the time (or creativity) to code up.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p5">
   <p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p5.1">
    With further development, a system like Snow Globe could be directed towards many potential applications. It could become a tool to help organizations solve problems, like in the HAIWIRE example. It could become a platform for automated wargaming, like in the geopolitical crisis simulation example. It could become a testbed for human-AI teaming. There will always be a place for humans in wargaming. Discovering the place for LLMs is only just beginning.

            Azuristan and Crimsonia are neighboring countries in Central Asia. Azuristan is a Western-backed democracy that suffers from endemic corruption. Crimsonia is controlled by an autocratic government that stifles dissent and commits human rights violations.

            <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1">
             Both countries have modern professional militaries, although Crimsonia’s is slightly larger than Azuristan’s. In addition, Azuristan possesses ten nuclear weapons and Crimsonia has eight.

            <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2">
             Most citizens of Azuristan are from the Azuristani ethnic group, and most citizens of Crimsonia are from the Crimsonian ethnic group. The only exception is Azuristan’s province of Tyriana, on the border with Crimsonia. Most residents of Tyriana belong to the Crimsonian ethnic group.
            </em>
            <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3">
             The animosity between Azuristan and Crimsonia extends back over centuries of ethnic tension and intermittent warfare. Recent years have been fairly calm. However, that suddenly changes when Tyriana declares independence. Amidst the crisis, local leaders in Tyriana ask Crimsonia to come to the province’s defense, and the same leaders indicate that they want Tyriana to become part of Crimsonia.

            In response to Tyriana’s declaration of independence and its request for assistance from Crimsonia, I would take the following actions:
           </span>
          </span>
          <span class="ltx_p" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.2">
           <span class="ltx_text" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.2.1" style="font-size:80%;">
            1. Immediately initiate diplomatic talks with both Tyriana’s leaders and the government of Crimsonia to try to resolve the situation peacefully. I would emphasize that Azuristan respects the right of Tyriana to self-determination but expects the province to remain a part of Azuristan.
           </span>
          </span>
          <span class="ltx_p" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.3">
           <span class="ltx_text" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1" style="font-size:80%;">
            2. Offer economic incentives to Tyriana for staying within Azuristan’s borders. These could include investing in infrastructure projects, providing financial support for development initiatives, or offering tax breaks for businesses in Tyriana.
           </span>
          </span>
          <span class="ltx_p" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.4">
           <span class="ltx_text" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.4.1" style="font-size:80%;">
            3. Strengthen the security presence in Azuristan’s border with Crimsonia to prevent any potential military escalation between our two countries. This could involve deploying more troops along the border, increasing surveillance capabilities, and coordinating with our regional allies to ensure a strong defense against potential aggression from Crimsonia.
           </span>
          </span>
          <span class="ltx_p" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.5">
           <span class="ltx_text" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.5.1" style="font-size:80%;">
            4. Engage in a public relations campaign aimed at promoting unity within Azuristan. This would involve highlighting our shared culture, history, and interests while downplaying ethnic differences. The aim would be to reduce tensions between different ethnic groups within our country and discourage any further separatist movements.
           </span>
          </span>
          <span class="ltx_p" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.6">
           <span class="ltx_text" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.6.1" style="font-size:80%;">
            5. Maintain close contact with the international community, particularly with countries that have influence over both Azuristan and Crimsonia, such as Western allies and regional powers. These countries could potentially help mediate the situation or apply diplomatic pressure on Crimsonia to back down from its support for Tyriana’s independence movement.
           </span>
          </span>
          <span class="ltx_p" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.7">

            6. If all else fails and it appears that military conflict may be imminent, I would consider offering further concessions to Tyriana or even entering into negotiations for a peaceful division of Azuristan, in order to prevent an all-out war that could jeopardize both countries’ stability and security.

            1. Assess the situation: First, I will gather information on the situation in Tyriana, including the reasons for declaring independence and the level of support for this move among Tyrian citizens. I will also analyze how this could affect relations with Azuristan and any potential impact on regional stability.
           </span>

            2. Offer support and diplomacy: I will offer support to Tyria in their struggle for independence while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic efforts with Azuristan. I will propose a peaceful resolution that would allow Tyriana to maintain its autonomy while ensuring that regional stability is maintained. This could involve international mediation or negotiations between the two nations.
           </span>

            3. Strengthen the Crimsonian people’s unity: In order to achieve our goal of unity among the Crimsonian people, I will emphasize our shared cultural heritage and history in my public speeches and messaging. I will also encourage dialogue between citizens of Tyriana and the rest of Crimsonia to promote understanding and mutual respect.
           </span>

            4. Maintain a strong but restrained military posture: While I will ensure that our military is prepared for any potential conflict, I will also be cautious in how we project our power and avoid escalating tensions with Azuristan. This may involve refraining from sending troops into Tyriana or engaging in aggressive military maneuvers near Azuristan’s border.
           </span>
          </span>
          <span class="ltx_p" id="Ax1.T4.1.1.1.6.6.1.1.6">

            5. Foster economic cooperation: To further promote peace between our nations, I will encourage trade and economic cooperation between Azuristan and Crimsonia. This could involve signing mutual trade agreements or forming joint ventures in various industries. By creating economic incentives for peace, we can make it more difficult for political tensions to lead to armed conflict.
           </span>

            By following these steps, I hope to address the crisis in Tyriana and maintain peace between Azuristan and Crimsonia while working towards the ultimate goal of unifying the Crimsonian people.

            In the next month, both the President of Azuristan and Premier of Crimsonia take their respective steps to address the crisis in Tyriana.

            However, unexpectedly, several key leaders within Tyriana defect to Azuristan, complicating negotiations for Tyriana’s independence. The international community becomes more involved, applying diplomatic pressure on both sides, with some countries threatening economic sanctions if peace talks fail.

As both leaders continue to navigate the delicate balance between diplomacy and military preparedness, the future of the region hangs in the balance.
