<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing importance of machine learning, the privacy and security of training data have become critical. Federated learning, which stores data in distributed nodes and shares only model parameters, has gained significant attention for addressing this concern. However, a challenge arises in federated learning due to the Byzantine Attack Problem, where malicious local models can compromise the global model’s performance during aggregation. This article proposes the <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">B</span>lockchain-based Byzantine-<span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">R</span>obust <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="id2.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning (BRLF) model that combines federated learning with blockchain technology. This integration enables traceability of malicious models and provides incentives for locally trained clients. Our approach involves selecting the aggregation node based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and we perform spectral clustering and calculate the average gradient within each cluster, validating its accuracy using local dataset of the aggregation nodes. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the superior byzantine robustness of our secure aggregation algorithm compared to other baseline byzantine robust aggregation methods, and proved our proposed model effectiveness in addressing the resource consumption problem.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> (FL) has revolutionized the traditional approach to machine learning by storing data locally on multiple nodes rather than on centralized servers. These nodes train the same model and then upload it to the server, allowing devices like smartphones, laptops, and in-car computers to participate in model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, federated learning has both positive and negative aspects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. On the positive side, it enhances the privacy and security of training data by keeping it locally stored and not shared with the server. It finds applications in various domains such as transportation, healthcare, and finance. On the negative side, since training data is not stored on the server, the server needs to aggregate parameters from multiple local models, which can be vulnerable to attacks from malicious nodes. Research in robust global model aggregation focuses on situations where some local models are under attack, while maintaining high performance for the global model. The key aspect of this research is to identify the attacked models and exclude them during the global model aggregation process, while retaining the benign models for aggregation. Therefore, secure global model aggregation algorithms play a vital role in federated learning. Specifically, our research aims to combat malicious local models and trace their activities. According to the survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the detection of malicious models can be achieved through model aggregation algorithms, and when combined with blockchain technology, it enables traceability of malicious gradients. Additionally, it provides rewards to nodes participating in federated learning, mitigating potential attacks such as middleman attacks and single point failures, and increasing the enthusiasm of nodes to participate in federated learning training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In blockchain-based federated learning, there are two inevitable problems in model aggregation: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">byzantine-attack</span> and <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">resource-cost</span>. These problems arise because it is not guaranteed that every local model trains in the intended direction. Local models are sent to the server for aggregation, but the server does not participate in their training. As a result, the server cannot verify the validity of the local models it receives, as it cannot access the local training data. <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Byzantine-attack</span> refer to the modification of training data or model parameters by local training nodes to attack the global model. The goal of such attacks is to reduce the accuracy of the global model or manipulate predictions for specific data. <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Resource-cost</span> refer to the significant computational resources consumed by existing secure aggregation methods that rely on local model accuracy verification. Additionally, solutions combining blockchain technology face challenges related to block storage.</p>

In the cosine angle-based method, attackers can manipulate the angles between malicious model updates and benign model updates to be smaller than the discrimination threshold of the defense method used.

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, we propose the Blockchain-based Federated Learning model (BRFL), which contains two main components: the Proof of Pearson Correlation Coefficient consensus algorithm (PPCC) and the Precision-based Spectral Aggregation (PSA) algorithm. PPCC selects the aggregation node for the next round based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between the local model and the global model from previous rounds. It also considers the lack of test datasets in FL by using the aggregation node’s local dataset for local model accuracy validation. PSA clusters local models with high correlation and verifies their accuracy by calculating the average value, thereby detecting malicious models and addressing the resource cost problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits high robustness and effectively reduces resource consumption.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section provides a comprehensive review of the relevant literature. We discuss two approaches to enhancing the security of federated learning: combining blockchain and Byzantine robust aggregation methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning and blockchain share a distributed architecture. Currently, there are solutions that improve the security of federated learning by using improved consensus algorithms, distributed ledgers, and encryption algorithms in blockchain. Bao <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed FLChain, where blocks in FLChain store participants’ personal information, data resource descriptions, historical federal training activities, and credibility, allowing historical information of federated learning to be queried in the blockchain. The dual committee introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, ensures the selection of good nodes and other nodes to build the committee, enabling more nodes to participate and preventing malicious nodes from attacking the training process. Islam <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> presents a blockchain-based data acquisition scheme during the pandemic, where federated learning is used to assemble privacy-sensitive data as a trained model instead of raw data. They also design a secure training scheme to mitigate cyber threats. Bift, proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> , is a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and blockchain. It provides a privacy-preserving ML process for connected and autonomous vehicles, allowing them to train their own machine learning models locally using their driving data and then upload the models to obtain a better global model. Biscotti, proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> , is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) approach to multi-party machine learning. It utilizes blockchain and cryptographic primitives to coordinate a privacy-preserving ML process between peering clients, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and defense against known attacks. Liu <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a cooperative intrusion detection mechanism that unloads the training model to distributed edge equipment, such as connecting vehicles and roadside units. This method reduces the resource utilization of the central server while ensuring security and privacy. To ensure the security of the aggregation model, blockchain is used to store and share training models.
Chen <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a blockchain-based decentralized FL framework, introduce a novel decentralized verification mechanism, design a specialized proof-of-equity consensus mechanism where honest devices can be rewarded with equity more frequently, thus protecting legitimate local model updates by increasing their chances of dominating blocks attached to the blockchain.</p>

By extending the HydRand protocol, a point-to-point FL with Byzantine fault tolerance is built. To protect their models, each autonomous vehicle (AV) uses a publicly verifiable secret sharing scheme that allows anyone to verify the correctness of the encrypted sharing.

The AG framework can be combined with most existing defenses, such as Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, to reduce variance and improve effectiveness.

It is based on a peer-to-peer network and incorporates encryption algorithms, consensus algorithms, and other technologies.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional cash systems, an institution endorses the currency, thereby assigning value to the coin. People recognize the value of the currency by acknowledging the credibility of the endorsing organization. However, in the first blockchain application, Bitcoin, Nakamoto introduces a method for everyone to maintain records of digital cash transactions between any individuals, eliminating the need for a single organization to endorse the trust of the transaction. The more people involved in ledger-keeping, the more secure and reliable the transaction history becomes.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A blockchain consists of blocks that are connected through a bidirectional linked list. Each block is divided into a block head and a block body. The block head contains the block generation timestamp, the hash value of the previous block, the hash value of the current block, the Merkle root (which ensures transaction consistency within the block), the block height, and other information. The block body contains transactions that occurred during a specific time period. Once recorded in a block, the transactions cannot be modified.</p>

In Bitcoin, the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm was introduced, where miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle to generate the next block. The first miner to solve the puzzle successfully adds the block to the chain and receives rewards for their efforts.</p>

By cutting the edges of the graph model, it aims to minimize the edge weights between different subgraphs and maximize the edge weights within each subgraph. Spectral clustering is employed to classify samples and tackle the clustering problem of sparse data, which is a limitation of the k-means clustering algorithm.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present a novel approach that combines blockchain technology with federated learning to enhance security and robustness. We propose BRLF, which incorporates a customized consensus algorithm and a robust aggregation mechanism. Our approach leverages blockchain technology, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), and spectral clustering techniques to effectively filter out malicious gradients during the global model aggregation process. This approach offers enhanced security and robustness for federated learning while reducing computation power costs. Furthermore, we introduce the utilization of IPFS and a new block structure to minimize storage resource costs.</p>

verified by all the aggregation nodes, and the sum of the average accuracy from each node is considered the final accuracy, as test results from a single aggregation node may be biased. The aggregation nodes are selected by comparing the PCCs of the last round of local and global models. It is important to note that the aggregation nodes from the previous round will not be selected as aggregation nodes for the next round. This is because aggregation nodes are not involved in training the local model but rather focus on verifying the local models and packaging blocks. The immutability of the blockchain ensures that the global model, local model, accuracy records, and Pearson correlation coefficient records cannot be tampered with, thus enhancing the security of federated learning.</p>

we have added a signal in the block head to indicate the type of content. This allows nodes to store only the blocks they need, thereby conserving storage resources. The transmission of local models and global models occurs through the blockchain’s peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The federated learning nodes are also part of the blockchain network. Local training nodes and aggregation nodes are rewarded with tokens for their contributions to model training, aggregation and blockchain packaging.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a blockchain, blocks need to be stored on nodes. The more nodes that store blocks in the blockchain network, the higher the security level and the lower the likelihood of tampering. However, storing blocks requires local storage space from the nodes. In the case of federated learning, where there are numerous training rounds, multiple participating nodes, and long training cycles, the types of participating nodes vary greatly. These nodes can include mobile phones, cars, computers, and more, each with different storage capacities.</p>

In federated learning, with multiple participating local training nodes, storing all the local models on the blockchain would result in numerous blocks generated in each training round, which hampers communication efficiency. IPFS will return a hash sequence, Content Identifier (CID), for each certain file upload, aggregation nodes can retrieve the local models from IPFS based on the CID, perform model aggregation, and store the aggregated global model within the blockchain. By storing the global model only once per round within the blockchain, local training nodes can directly access it from the blockchain instead of IPFS, thereby improving their work efficiency.

Second, we perform spectral clustering on the local models based on PCC. This allows us to calculate the average gradient for each cluster after clustering. The aggregation nodes selected by the PPCC consensus algorithm then verifies the accuracy rate of the average gradient using its local database. The average gradient which has the max average accuracy validated by aggregation nodes will be the global model. This approach enhances the fault tolerance, reduces resource consumption, and improves sensitivity to small sample compared to existing methods.

This is because the blockchain network nodes store all types of blocks in the blockchain, and each round of the federated learning process produces blocks that are of the same or similar size. Among the nodes of type <span id="S5.SS6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">W/M</span>, the block size of the benign nodes shows a nonlinear increasing trend. This is because when a benign node becomes an aggregation node, it stores all types of blocks, whereas as a local training node, it only stores one type of block. As the benign node alternates between being an aggregation node and a local training node, the size of the blockchain it stores shows a nonlinear increasing trend. The blockchain size in malicious nodes also shows a linear increasing trend, but the increase is smaller. This is because in the BRFL model, malicious models are detected, and malicious nodes are prevented from becoming aggregation nodes. Therefore, malicious nodes only store blocks of the global model type as local training nodes.</p>

<div id="S5.SS7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In most cases, the number of times malicious nodes become aggregation nodes is 0. However, there are still a small number of cases where they become aggregation nodes. This may occur when there is no global model at the initialization of federated learning or when the global model is not yet perfect, resulting in random selection of nodes as aggregation nodes during the first round. However, as observed from the figure, the occurrences of malicious nodes becoming aggregation nodes are minimal. This indicates that the PPCC algorithm effectively prevents malicious nodes from being selected as aggregation nodes.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose BRFL, a blockchain-based Byzantine-robust federated learning model. Our objective is to address the issues of <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">byzantine-attack</span> and <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">resource-cost</span> during model aggregation. The <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">resource-cost</span> problem can be further divided into computation resource costs and storage resource costs. To achieve this, we introduce two key components: the Proof of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PPCC) consensus algorithm and the Precision-based Spectral Aggregation (PSA) algorithm. These components verify the accuracy of the average gradient by clustering the local model gradients and store federated learning communication records in the blockchain. Additionally, we utilize IPFS to store the local models and allow nodes to selectively store blocks, effectively managing storage requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that BRFL maintains Byzantine robustness with reduced resource costs.</p>
