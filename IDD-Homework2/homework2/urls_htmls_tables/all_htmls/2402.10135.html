<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The increasing requirements for data protection and privacy has attracted a huge research interest on distributed artificial intelligence and specifically on federated learning, an emerging machine learning approach that allows the construction of a model between several participants who hold their own private data. In the initial proposal of federated learning the architecture was centralised and the aggregation was done with federated averaging, meaning that a central server will orchestrate the federation using the most straightforward averaging strategy. This research is focused on testing different federated strategies in a peer-to-peer environment. The authors propose various aggregation strategies for federated learning, including weighted averaging aggregation, using different factors and strategies based on participant contribution. The strategies are tested with varying data sizes to identify the most robust ones. This research tests the strategies with several biomedical datasets and the results of the experiments show that the accuracy-based weighted average outperforms the classical federated averaging method.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Artificial intelligence applications in healthcare are increasing every day. These applications have the ability to advance the healthcare industry by, for instance, supporting clinical decision making, risk prediction, developing early warning systems for patients, increasing the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, improving patient–physician interaction, and optimizing operations and resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a new approach for distributed artificial intelligence that aims to have several agents train a deep learning model in a collaborative and secure way, without sharing any private data. This training is done the following way: a central server defines a deep learning model and sends it to the agents, who train the model in their private data. Then, they send the parameters of the model (weights or gradients) back to the server, who aggregates these data in order to find a global federated model, which in turn is delivered back to the agents to be retrained in their data. This process is iterated until convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the initial definition of the federated learning approach, the aggregation step is done by averaging the model parameters. Nevertheless, other aggregation methods may be of more interest since they can improve the performance of the model by giving more weight to different agents depending on their size or the performance of the local models in their data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an emerging approach for distributed artificial intelligence in which the different data owners (or participants) train collaboratively a machine learning model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The model is updated (trained) in the own private data of each participant and then the trained model is sent for aggregation to a central server or one of the participants. It was first proposed by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and further developed in Konecny et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and McMahan and Ramage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
The main advantage of federated learning is the training of a model with the private data of each participant keeping the security and compliance requirements while improving their models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. It also allows the use of more accurate models with low latency, ensuring privacy and less power consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fully decentralised learning aims to replace server-based communication with peer-to-peer communication among individual clients as its core concept. Each round in fully decentralized algorithms involves a client performing a local update and sharing information with their neighbors in the graph. In this research, clients share the model with all participants, making it a fully connected peer-to-peer architecture (see Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Architecture ‣ 2 Fundamentals ‣ Benchmarking federated strategies in Peer-to-Peer Federated learning for biomedical data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Peer-to-peer architectures can have a significant impact on federated learning. With peer-to-peer communication, clients can collaborate and share locally trained models directly with each other, which can result in faster and more efficient learning compared to a centralized architecture. Peer-to-peer architectures can also provide better privacy and security as the clients can keep their data locally and only share the necessary information with their peers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, a fully decentralised solution where participants collaborate asynchronously and communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion, without any central server to orchestrate a global state of the system or even to coordinate the protocol, is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. In this scenario, peer-to-peer architectures can also have some challenges. For example, it can be more difficult to coordinate and manage the communication between clients, and it may require additional mechanisms to ensure the consistency of the model across all clients. To overcome this challenge, this paper focuses on a fully connected peer-to-peer architecture. Moreover, this kind of systems may not be suitable for large-scale federated learning scenarios due to the high communication overhead between clients. However, the goal of this research is to present a fault-tolerant architecture in case of failure of a central server and/or in multiple participants.</p>

Indeed, peer-to-peer algorithms include scalability-by-design to large sets of devices thanks to the locality of their updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In addition, a decentralised peer-to-peer architecture intrinsically provides an additional some security guarantee as it becomes much more tough for any third party to get the full state information of the system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The federated learning proposal starts with a central server sending an untrained model to the participants. As a first step, each hospital trains this model with their training data, evaluates it in their test data, and sends the parameters of the trained model back to the server. After receiving all the parameters from all the participants, in this proposal the server aggregates the parameters using one of the aggregation methods described in Section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3 Federation strategies ‣ 2 Fundamentals ‣ Benchmarking federated strategies in Peer-to-Peer Federated learning for biomedical data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a> to obtain the global method. This process is iterated until convergence.
In this use case the authors have proposed a peer-to-peer architecture, and have not included an additional encryption layer, but it is possible and desirable to do so in real-life applications in healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the following experiments, the initial model will be a dense neural network made of five layers followed by a non-linear ReLU function and a dropout layer for regularization (Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Methodological proposal ‣ Benchmarking federated strategies in Peer-to-Peer Federated learning for biomedical data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). For training, the loss function will be computed using the Binary Cross Entropy.</p>

<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As a setup for the experiments, the authors assume that several hospitals with their own private data wish to train a deep learning model for diagnosis of a disease, but the size of their data is not large enough for training an accurate model. The data of all the hospitals should not be combined due to data regulations given their special sensitivity. Therefore, for each one of the experiments the corresponding dataset will be randomly split in five different subsets, to simulate five hospitals. In a first test all of them will have the same amount of data, obtained by splitting evenly the dataset. The other three test will be random splits among the participants, where in the last two we have forced that there would be several participants with a very small number of samples (less than 10%). The distribution of the variables, including the percentage of positive cases for the target, will also vary from one hospital to another.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In every case, each participant’s data will be split into a train and a test dataset for training and evaluation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The metric we will use to compare the performance of the different models and methods is the accuracy on the test set. Given a classification model, its performance can be summarized with a confusion matrix, a table that shows the number of real positive and negative samples in our dataset versus the number of positive and negative values that our classifier predicts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The accuracy of a model is the ratio of number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples,
that is, the sum of the main diagonal of the confusion matrix divided by the sum of all values in the table, which is the amount of times the classifier got the prediction right. This metric varies between 0 and 1, where 0 is the worst case scenario, and 1 is associated to a perfect classifier. Moreover, a random binary classifier such as a coin toss has an accuracy of 0.5, and therefore this is a first baseline for any balanced binary classifier, understanding that an accuracy close to 0.5 is as bad as a random guess.

As we can see, the federation improves the accuracy metrics in general, but there are differences between the aggregation methods used. In the first case of the even dataset all accuracies are improved, but in the first uneven split, the contribution aggregation of the difference of the losses does not induce an increase in the performance. In the second uneven split, more extreme than the previous one, with one participant with only 3% of the data, the Federated Averaging does not improve the performance of the local models, and in the last one, with two participants with 6% and 7% of the data, the weighted aggregation using the size of each participant and the size and the accuracy show a lower accuracy than the first iteration of local models.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The term chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes all degrees of decreased renal function. It is more prevalent in the elderly population and it is estimated that affects 10–15% of the world population. CKD is not often identified in premature stages.</p>

In this case, the aggregation using the inverse contribution does not improve the accuracy for all participants, since this metric worsens for the first uneven split. The size-based and contribution-base aggregation do not increase the accuracy of the local models for this split as well, while the Federated Averaging fails for the last uneven split and the size and accuracy weighted average for the second one. As in the previous experiment, the only aggregation method that impoves the accuracy for all cases is the accuracy-based one.</p>

In this case, the splits are more polarized, finding that with the even split and the first uneven split all aggregation methods improve the performance of the local models, while for the second uneven split, with two participants with 4% and 6% of the data, no aggregation increases the accuracy. In the last uneven split, all aggregation methods improve the local models except the Federated Averaging.</p>

With the even split we see that all aggregation methods improve the accuracy of the local models but for the aggregation based in a weighted average of the size of the participants and the accuracy of the local model. In the case of the first uneven split, the only aggregation methods that are able to improve the performance are the size-based and the accuracy-based. On the other hand, for the second uneven split, with two participants with 2% and 4% of the data, all aggregation methods increase the accuracy. Finally, for the last uneven split, only the Federated Averaging and the accuracy-based aggregation improve the performance of the models, resulting on the accuracy-based aggregation being the only aggregation that improves in all cases for this dataset.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a distributed artificial intelligence approach that can be very useful for hospitals to build collaboratively a machine learning model in a secure way, without sharing their private data. Nevertheless, the aggregation method is a decisive parameter that can change the performance of the final federated model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this research we have proved that the classical Federated Averaging is a reliable aggregation method that improves the performance of the local methods in 11 out of 16 cases that we have contemplated. Nevertheless, there are other aggregation methods with similar or even better behaviour. The contribution-based aggregation, using the difference between the losses of the global and local model, increases the accuracy in 11 out of 16 cases as well, while the size-based and the inverse contribution-based perform better in one more case. The weighted average using both the size of the participant’s dataset and the accuracy of the local model increase the accuracy in only 10 cases out of 16. Finally, the weighted average using the accuracy outperforms all aggregation methods, improving the accuracy in 15 out of 16 cases, that is, in all experiments but one partition where all other methods failed to increase the performance as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With this results, the authors believe that an accuracy-based federated learning may perform better than the Federated Averaging classical approach. A fully connected peer-to-peer architecture has been used to show a resilient architecture against different points of failures, including the central server. As limitations of this study, using open-source datasets instead of real-world data in a study on federated learning with medical data may limit the realism, generalization, diversity, quality, and ethical considerations of the research findings.</p>
