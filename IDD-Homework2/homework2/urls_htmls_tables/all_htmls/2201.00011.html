<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system (EFDLS) for multi-task time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based student-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher’s hidden layers to its student’s hidden layers via knowledge distillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure. For each connected user, its student model’s hidden layers’ weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user’s and its partner’s weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user’s and its partner’s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers’ hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed EFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets regarding top-1 accuracy.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">TSC algorithms are usually data-driven, where data comes from various application domains. Some data may contain private and sensitive information, such as bank account and ECG. However, traditional data collection operations could not well protect such information, easily resulting in users’ privacy leakage during the data collection and distribution processes involved in model training. To overcome the problem above, Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> invented federated learning (FL). FL allows users to collectively harvest the advantages of shared models trained from their local data without sending original data to others. FederatedAveraging (FedAvg), federated transfer learning (FTL) and federated knowledge distillation (FKD) are the three mainstream research directions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FedAvg calculates the average weights of the models of all users and shares the weights with each user in the FL system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. For instance, Ma <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> devised a communication-efficient federated generalized tensor factorization for electronic health records.

A hierarchical personalized FL method aggregated heterogeneous user models, with privacy heterogeneity and model heterogeneity considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">FTL introduces transfer learning techniques to promote knowledge transfer between different users, increasing system accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. For example, Yang <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> developed an FTL framework, FedSteg, for secure image steganalysis. An FTL method with dynamic gradient aggregation was proposed to weight the local gradients during the aggregation step when handling speech recognition tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike FedAvg and FTL, FKD takes the average of all users’ weights as the weights for all teachers and transfers each teacher’s knowledge to its corresponding student via knowledge distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.

</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Most FL algorithms are developed around single-task problems, where multiple users work together to complete a task, e.g., COVID-19 detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, traffic classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> or speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. It is quite challenging to directly apply these algorithms to multi-task problems unless efficient knowledge sharing among different tasks is enabled. Unfortunately, TSC is usually multi-task-oriented. Time series data is collected from various application domains, such as ECG, traffic flow, human activity recognition. Each time series dataset has specific characteristics, e.g., length and variance, which may differ significantly from others. Thus, time series data is highly imbalanced and strongly non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-I.I.D.). In multi-task learning, it is commonly recognized that knowledge sharing among different tasks helps increase the efficiency and accuracy of each task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">For most TSC algorithms, how to securely share knowledge of similar expertise among different tasks is still challenging. In other words, user privacy and knowledge sharing are two critical issues that need to be carefully addressed when devising practical multi-task TSC algorithms</span>. To the best of our knowledge, FL for multi-task TSC has not received sufficient research attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We present an efficient federated distillation learning system (EFDLS) for multi-task TSC. This system consists of a central server and a number of mobile users running various TSC tasks simultaneously. Given two arbitrary users, they run either different tasks (e.g., ECG and motion) or the same task with different data sources to mimic real-world applications. EFDLS is characterized by a feature-based student-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. The FBST framework is deployed on each user, where the student and teacher models have identical network structure. Within each user, its teacher’s hidden layers’ knowledge is transferred to its student’s hidden layers, helping the student mine high-quality features from the data. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the EFDLS server, where the least square distance (LSD) is used to measure the similarity between the weights of two models. When all connected users’ weights are uploaded completely, for an arbitrary connected user, the DBWM scheme finds the one with the most similar weights among all connected users. After that, the server sends the connected user’s weights to the found one that then loads the weights to its teacher model’s hidden layers.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The overview of EFDLS is shown in Fig. 1. In the system, users train their models locally based on knowledge distillation and share their model weights with users with similar expertise via the server. We propose FBST, a feature-based student-teacher framework that is deployed on each user as its learning model. Within each user, its teacher’s hidden layers’ knowledge is transferred to its student’s hidden layers. For each connected user, its student model’s hidden layers’ weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. We propose DBWM, a distance-based weights matching scheme deployed on the server, with the LSD adopted to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. After the weights of all connected users are uploaded completely, for each connected user, the DBWM scheme is launched to find the one with the most similar weights among all connected users. In this way, every user has a partner to match with. For each connected user, its uploaded weights are sent to its partner that then loads these weights to its teacher model’s hidden layers. The server’s role looks like a telecom-network switch. The EFDLS system allows users to benefit from knowledge sharing without sacrificing security and privacy.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The UCR 2018 archive is one of the most popular time series repositories with 128 datasets of different lengths in various application domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. Following the previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, we divide the UCR 2018 archive into 4 categories with respect to dataset length, namely, ‘short’, ‘medium’, ‘long’, and ‘vary’. The length of a ‘short’ dataset is no more than 200. That of a ‘medium’ one varies from 200 to 500. A ‘long’ one has a length of over 500 while a ‘vary’ one has an indefinite length. The 128 datasets are composed of 41 ‘short’ , 32 ‘medium’, 44 ‘long’, and 11 ‘vary’ datasets. Unfortunately, our limited computing resources do not allow us to consider the whole 128 datasets (detailed hardware specification can be found in Subsection <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Implementation Details</span>). There are seven algorithms for performance comparison and the average training time on the 128 datasets costed more than 32 hours for a single federated learning epoch. So, we select 11 datasets from each category, resulting in 44 datasets selected. More details are found in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 3.3.1 Least Square Distance ‣ 3.3 Distance-based Weights Matching ‣ 3 EFDLS ‣ An Efficient Federated Distillation Learning System for Multi-task Time Series Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.</p>

For an arbitrary algorithm, its ‘win’, ‘tie’, and ‘lose’ values indicate on how many datasets it is better than, equal to, and worse than the others, respectively; its ‘best’ value is the summation of the corresponding ‘win’ and ‘tie’ values. The AVG_rank score reflects the average difference between the accuracy values of a model and the best accuracy values among all models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>.</p>

One can observe that EFDLS beats Baseline in every aspect, including ‘Win’/‘Lose’/‘Tie’, MeanACC, and AVG_rank. For example, the former wins 18 out of 44 datasets while the latter wins only 4. The accuracy plot of EFDLS vs. Baseline in Fig. 4(a) also supports the finding above. The main difference between EFDLS and Baseline is that the latter only uses standalone feature extractors which do not share the locally collected knowledge with each other. On the other hand, with sufficient knowledge sharing of similar expertise among users enabled, EFDLS improves the system’s generalization ability and thus achieves promising multi-task TSC performance.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, we study the effectiveness of <span id="S4.SS4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the FBST framework</span> by comparing EFDLS with FTLS. It is easily seen that EFDLS outperforms FTLS regarding the ‘best’, MeanACC, and AVG_rank values. The accuracy plot of EFDLS vs. FTLS in Fig. 4(f) also supports this. The FBST framework allows efficient knowledge transfer from teacher to student, helping the student capture sufficient discriminate representations from the input data. On the contrary, the FTLS’s learning model lacks of self-generalization, leading to deteriorated performance during knowledge sharing.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Thirdly, we study the effectiveness of <span id="S4.SS4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the DBWM scheme</span> by comparing EFDLS with FKD. Apparently, EFDLS overweighs FKD with respect to ‘best’, MeanACC, and AVG_rank. It is backed by the accuracy plot of EFDLS vs. FTLS in Fig. 4(g). As mentioned before, at each federated learning epoch, the DBWM scheme finds a partner for each user and then EFDLS offers weights exchange between each pair of connected users, which realizes knowledge sharing of similar expertise among different users. In contrast, FKD adopts the average weights to supervise the feature extraction process in each user. It is likely to lead to catastrophic forgetting in a user whose weights significantly differ from the average weights.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Last but not least, we compare EFDLS with all the seven algorithms. One can easily observe that our EFDLS is no doubt the best among all algorithms for comparison since ours obtains the highest MeanACC and ‘best’ values, namely 0.7014 and 20, and the smallest AVG_rank value, namely 2.1478. The FKD takes the second position when considering its ‘best’, MeanACC, and AVG_rank values, namely, 11, 0.6878, and 2.6364. On the other hand, FedAvg and its variant, FedAvgM, are the two worst algorithms. The following explains the reasons behind the findings above. When faced with the multi-task TSC problem, each user runs one TSC task, and different users may run different TSC tasks. The FBST framework and the DBWM scheme help EFDLS to realize fine-grained knowledge sharing between any pair of users with the most similar expertise. FKD uses the average of all users’ weights to guide each user to capture valuable features from the data, promoting coarse-grained knowledge sharing among users. On the other hand, FedAvg and FedAvgM simply take the average weights of all users as each user’s weights, which may cause catastrophic forgetting and hence poor performance on multi-task TSC.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FBST framework promotes knowledge transfer from a teacher’s to its student’s hidden layers, helping the student capture instance-level representations from the input. The DBWM scheme finds a partner for each user in terms of similarity between their uploaded weights, enabling knowledge sharing of similar expertise among different users. With FBST and DBWM, the proposed EFDLS securely shares knowledge of similar expertise among different tasks for multi-task time series classification. Experimental results show that compared with six benchmark FL algorithms, EFDLS is a winner on 44 datasets with respect to the MeanACC and AVG_rank metrics and on 20 datasets in terms of the ‘best’ measure. In particular, compared with single-task Baseline, EFDLS obtains 32/4/8 regarding the ‘win’/‘tie’/‘lose’ metric. That reflects the potential of EFDLS to be applied to multi-task TSC problems in various real-world domains.</p>
