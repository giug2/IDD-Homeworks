<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm to cooperatively train a global model with highly distributed data. A major bottleneck on the performance of distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for large-scale Federated Learning is the communication overhead on pushing local gradients and pulling global model. In this paper, to reduce the communication complexity of Federated Learning, a novel approach named Pulling Reduction with Local Compensation (PRLC) is proposed. Specifically, each training node intermittently pulls the global model from the server in SGD iterations, resulting in that it is sometimes unsynchronized with the server. In such a case, it will use its local update to compensate the gap between the local model and the global model. Our rigorous theoretical analysis of PRLC achieves two important findings. First, we prove that the convergence rate of PRLC preserves the same order as the classical synchronous SGD for both strongly-convex and non-convex cases with good scalability due to the linear speedup with respect to the number of training nodes. Second, we show that PRLC admits lower pulling frequency than the existing pulling reduction method without local compensation. We also conduct extensive experiments on various machine learning models to validate our theoretical results. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant pulling reduction over the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., PRLC requiring only half of the pulling operations of LAG.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The explosion of data and rapid increase in model size have led to great attention to distributed
machine learning approaches. Recently, Federated Learning has been proposed to enable a large number of
workers, e.g., phones, tablets, and sensors, to cooperatively train a global model without exposing
their own data. The most widely used training algorithm is distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD),
where individual workers iteratively refresh the global model located on the server via operations of
pushing gradients to and pulling model from the server. The huge communication overhead imposes a bottleneck on the performance of Federated Learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently the mainstream to reduce the communication overhead is in two orthogonal lines: compressing the transmission data and reducing the pushing/pulling operations. Although data compression based methods, e.g., sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>
and quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, have shown effectiveness in reducing transmission bits, the cost of other communication overhead,
e.g., searching servers, queuing and propagating messages in the network, could not be ignored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the transmission energy of low-power wireless devices is often dominated by activation of communication modules and less so by the actual signal amplitude or feature output dimension <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
To this end, it is of great significance to investigate the approach of reducing the number of pushing/pulling operations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the pushing operations, Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> propose excluding the workers with outlier updates deviated from the average update of all workers.
However, their method could not be used to reduce the pulling operations because the global model is unique and has no outliers.
Recently, Chen et al. propose an adaptive algorithm LAG to reduce the pulling operations, in which the outdated model and gradient are reused and thus the workers do not need to pull the global model in some specific iterations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, LAG requires the gradient varying slowly. This assumption holds only when the Batch Gradient Descent based algorithms. Our experiment shows that it indeed does not help much for SGD.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel method to reduce the communication overhead of SGD-based Federated Learning named Pulling Reduction with Local Compensation (PRLC). The main idea is that workers intermittently pull global model from the server and when they decide not to pull, they compensate the gap with the local updates. Specifically, the local update is utilized to approximate the average update of all workers which is used to compensate the gap between local model and global model. We prove that our method yields smaller pulling ratio (proportion of workers that synchronizes with the global model) than the pulling rounds reduction method without local compensation. Furthermore, our method largely improves the training speed. We also theoretically show that our method has better scalability than the popular method Asynchronous SGD (ASGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and experimentally present that our method outperforms ASGD in terms of the convergence time.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the size of communication data, compression-based methods, e.g., gradient sparsification and quantization, have been proposed recently. Gradient sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> reduces the communication cost by only transmitting a portion of the dimensions of the gradient. AdaComp <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> proposes a dynamic strategy for the selection of dimensions. Xiao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> sample dimensions of the gradient to accelerate the training process. Gradient quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> quantizes the value of gradient from 32-bit float number to some lower bit representation with lower precision. QSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is a general framework for quantization, in which the relationship between the quantized level and the convergence rate has been established.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The asynchronous distributed learning algorithm has been proposed to improve the computation efficiency over the synchronous method, of which the key concept is to improve the hardware computing efficiency by sacrificing some convergence rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Another way is to overlap the computation and communication to reduce the run time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Shen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> further improve the computation efficiency by overlapping the communication with multiple local computation steps. Though these methods have made great progress in reducing the training time, communication overhead is not alleviated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are also some methods that improe convergence efficiency with less iterations. These methods could also reduce the communication overhead as by-product. Newton method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>
uses the second-order information to speed up training and thus incurs less the communication rounds.
However, these methods are easily trapped to the saddle point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Alternatively, some other methods use large batch size with a large learning rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> to accelerate convergence,
but they do not have theoretical guarantees and may result in accuracy loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the pushing/pulling operations reduction methods are proposed to specifically reduce the communication overhead with the convergence preserved. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>
propose reducing the number of pushing communication operations by excluding the updates of some workers, but their method could not be applied to reducing the number of pulling communication operations. Recently LAG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and its variant LAQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> are recently proposed to reduce the number of pulling communication operations by adaptively reusing the outdated gradients. However, reusing outdated gradients only holds in BGD of which the gradients vary little. Consequently, there is still a deficiency for pulling operations reduction for SGD which is solved by our work.</p>

The theoretical results show that the PRLC essentially admits the same convergence rate as classical synchronous SGD. Due to the page limitation, we give the sketch of the proof for the main theorem and omit other proofs. Details are presented in full paper.</p>

The communication rounds are compared by using the average of accumulated pulling rounds of each worker. We then investigate the impact of different pulling ratios. Next, we present the efficiency of local compensation by comparing PRLC to PR. Finally, the time performance of PRLC is tested in a simulated setting of the edge environment.</p>

As to the pulling communication rounds reduction, it clearly shows that
PRLC achieves a better result than
LAG-PS which has no reduction at all. This is because reusing gradient of
LAG-PS does not hold in the stochastic cases where the gradients vary largely.

For both convex and non-convex models, PRLC outperforms PR significantly.
This is because PRLC compensates the update gap in the intermittent iterations
with local update while PR not. Consequently, the local compensation of PRLC

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel method for reducing pulling communication rounds, called PRLC. In PRLC, each worker intermittently pulls the global model from the server and compensates the gap with its local update when not pulling the model. We establish the convergence theory of PRLC for both strongly convex and general non-convex cases.
The theoretical results show that the convergence rate of PRLC is in the same order as the non-reduction method. Besides, we also prove that our method has a better
tolerance for low pulling ratio over the reduction method without local compensation
and has better scalability than ASGD.
To validate the efficiency of our method, extensive experiments are conducted for both strongly-convex and non-convex machine learning models by using general datasets.
Experimental results present that PRLC significantly improves the efficiency in
terms of the reduction of both the communication rounds and the convergence time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, we try to consider more factors of the Federated Learning scenarios.
For example, Non-IID of the datasets between workers is one of the main property in the edge environment. However, our method has not taken this property into account which still has a lot of room for improvement.</p>
