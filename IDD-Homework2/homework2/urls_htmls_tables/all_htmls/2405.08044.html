<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a novel collaborative machine learning framework designed to preserve privacy while enabling the creation of robust models. This paradigm addresses a growing need for data security by allowing multiple participants to contribute to a model without exposing their individual datasets. A pivotal issue within this framework, however, concerns the fair and accurate attribution of contributions from various participants to the creation of the joint global model. Incorrect contribution distribution can erode trust among participants, result in inequitable compensation, and ultimately diminish the willingness of parties to engage or actively contribute to the federation. While several methods for remunerating participants have been proposed, little attention was given to the analysis of the stability of these methods when evaluating contributions, which is critical to ensure the long-term viability and fairness of FL systems. 
<br class="ltx_break">In this paper, we analyse this stability through the calculation of contributions by gradient-based model reconstruction techniques with Shapley values. Our investigation reveals that Shapley values fail to reflect baseline contributions, especially when employing different aggregation techniques. 
<br class="ltx_break">To address this issue, we extend on established aggregation techniques by introducing <span id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span>, which is designed to sample contributions in a more equitable and distributed manner. We demonstrate that this approach not only serves as a viable aggregation technique but also significantly improves the accuracy of contribution assessment compared to traditional methods. Our results suggest that <span id="id4.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span> enhances the overall fairness and stability of the federated learning system, making it a superior choice for federations with limited number of participants.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning has gained a lot of traction in recent years as a prevalent form of collaborative learning. It has seen adoption in a vast array of domains, ranging from financial corporations and medical institutions to IoT devices, with major industry players such as Google and Nvidia offering in-house platforms and solutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Federated Learning, a strategy defines the approach in which the central server handles a federation. Since the inception of Federated Learning, numerous strategies have been introduced to manage specific problems, among which are poor performance on heterogeneous datasets, attacks by malicious clients, and the convergence speed of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are two primary categories of Federated Learning: cross-device and cross-silo. In the cross-device approach, a large number of distributed clients, usually with small volumes of data, collaborate to construct a robust model. On the other hand, cross-silo involves a few participants with larger amounts of data working together to create a model that incorporates the specific knowledge of each entity. In an environment comprised of profit-driven entities, correctly assessing contributions is of utmost importance, as participants may invest money in infrastructure and compliance in hopes of receiving their equitable part of the payout.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the following sections, we delve into the analysis of a cross-silo FL scenario and the stability of contribution evaluation. Specifically, this use case portrays a federation whose clients may need an incentive to join and stay in the federation (i.e. participants leave if they are not adequately compensated).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">By shedding light on the inherent instability of contribution evaluation between some of the most popular strategies and how this can be mitigated, we hope to provide a foundation for future aggregation strategies to self-evaluate not only their performance under traditional metrics, but also the contribution evaluation stability.
In summary, we provide the following contributions:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several approaches have been devised for the evaluation of participants’ contribution during global model creation in Federated Learning.
We give a brief overview of the most common approaches, which can be based on either numeric computations or self-disclosed information and estimations by the central server.</p>
</div>
<section id="S2.SS0.SSSx1" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Self-reported</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The most direct approach seen in previous work is to have the participants perform their own reporting, providing information regarding their local model training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">28</span></a>]</cite> . The information provided may encompass aspects such as the quality and quantity of data provided by the participant; costs associated with data collection, processing and communication in the federation. The aggregator then utilizes this data to assign contribution ratings to the clients. A limitation of these approaches is that the assumption of honesty and the ability of clients to evaluate their own conditions.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="S2.SS0.SSSx2" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Shapley values</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly to their usage in game theory to evaluate the contribution of players to a common task, Shapley values are the most common approach to numerically assess individual clients’ contribution to the shared model in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS0.SSSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although it has been proposed to calculate Shapley values in FL by evaluating the performance of fully-trained federated models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">24</span></a>]</cite>, a more common approach is to use gradient-based model reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">22</span></a>]</cite> or Monte Carlo methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">25</span></a>]</cite>, which assess contributions at each federation round. This is of particular interest in continuous learning tasks, where data and thus contribution distributions might change. In these settings, payouts may occur periodically instead of just once. To assess Shapley values, the evaluating entity does need a validation dataset.</p>

<section id="S2.SS0.SSSx3" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Influence</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another approach for quantifying the contribution of participants is through the use of influence based methods. These apply a systematic method for quantifying the impact of individual data points on the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">10</span></a>]</cite>. Influence can be computed by assessing the disparity in models when trained with and without the specific data points. This approach was used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite> to provide incentives for clients to provide high-quality data during the training process. Although the influence metric offers detailed insights, its computation can be challenging due to the expensive nature of re-training models, often exacerbated by the fact that access to the clients’ individual data points might be limited due to privacy constraints.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Auctions</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSSx4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSSx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In diverse areas of Federated Learning, auctions serve as a fundamental economic mechanism to allocate resources such as training data and computational power, setting prices through bidding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">23</span></a>]</cite>. The primary stakeholders involved are the bidders (model owners or FL service requesters), sellers (data owners or clients), and auctioneers (intermediaries facilitating the auction), aiming to optimise resource distribution and establish fair pricing. While contribution estimation is an important aspect, other key concepts in auction theory include valuation, utility, and social welfare, with the ultimate goal being to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of resource allocation in FL environments.
An example is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">27</span></a>]</cite>, the multi-dimensional procurement auction model FMore is proposed to incentivize clients with more data quality in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to participate.</p>

This is no different in Federated Learning scenarios, where fairness of the global model and trust between participants are crucial to the operation of the federation. As we have shown that contributions might be highly different depending on aggregation strategy, we argue that contribution evaluation in Federated Learning is neither robust nor generalized, and, depending on the definition of fairness, not fair.
With high instability, as shown above, trust in the contribution calculation and consequently in the federation should not be expected. This may prove critical in environments where participants are profit-driven participants, as it might lead to disagreements over remuneration and non-participation as a result: A participant whose contribution turns out to be less than expected may argue that the chosen strategy disadvantages them. This hurts the overall federation, as the particular participant might have possessed particularly valuable data which the global model, and thus everybody involved, might profit off.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A solution could be to try out different strategies and use the means of contribution values. However, as we have shown that contribution variance between strategies is quite high, one would need a substantial amount of different strategies to calculate a representative contribution value, requiring the development and implementation of many different strategies.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work has brought to light a concern regarding the stability of popular Federated Learning strategies when evaluating the contribution of participants. Our findings underscore the potential challenges and risks associated with deploying cross-silo federated learning platforms in industrial settings, given the discrepancy of contribution amongst these strategies. Future proposed FL strategies should take these findings into account, conducting performative analysis on the accuracy of the strategies’ contributions compared to Data Shapley. If results are not satisfactory, <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span> can be proposed to circumvent the shortcomings of the strategy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With <span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span> sampling, central servers can estimate contributions before running a federation. Not only are these contribution values more stable than when sampling different strategies, they are also closer to central Data Shapley values than any single strategy we tested.
In a deployed cross-silo federation, this reduces friction between participants: As opposed to before, when a specific aggregation strategy might have been more beneficial to a client, they have already statistically relevantly sampled contribution values. This leaves the option to choose the strategy which is most beneficial to the federation as a whole, eliminating inter-client concurrence. Also, as we have shown, participants get rewarded more fairly than with any single aggregation strategy.
Additionally, as <span id="S5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span> performs closely to other strategies, using the best sample as an initial weight allows the federation to perform better from the start. Assuming sampling is run in parallel, training time stays the same, with only a minimal negative impact on optimal performance during sampling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span> introduces additional computational effort to a federation. Being a sampling technique, this effort scales linearly with the amount of generated samples. However, more substantially, the computational effort scales exponentially with the number of clients, rendering simulations in high-client environments highly demanding. This problem is inherent to any numerical contribution calculation using Shapley values, and does not stem from <span id="S5.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span>.
Moreover, the implementation of <span id="S5.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span> may prove more complicated due to the major amount of aggregation strategies involved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In future works, the effect of more aggregation strategies to <span id="S5.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span>, as well as the importance of the strategy types should be studied. An implementation of faster Shapley computation methods such as <span id="S5.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FastShap</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">7</span></a>]</cite> would allow for more extensive experiments on bigger client sets. Additionally, the possible benefits of randomly mixing strategies, as proposed by <span id="S5.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">FedRandom</span>, should be explored in a more general context.</p>
