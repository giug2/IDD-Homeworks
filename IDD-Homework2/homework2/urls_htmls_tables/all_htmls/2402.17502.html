<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) effectively mitigates the data silo challenge brought about by policies and privacy concerns, implicitly harnessing more data for deep model training.
However, traditional centralized FL models grapple with diverse multi-center data, especially in the face of significant data heterogeneity, notably in medical contexts.
In the realm of medical image segmentation, the growing imperative to curtail annotation costs has amplified the importance of weakly-supervised techniques which utilize sparse annotations such as points, scribbles, etc.
A pragmatic FL paradigm shall accommodate diverse annotation formats across different sites, which research topic remains under-investigated.
In such context, we propose a novel personalized FL framework with learnable prompt and aggregation (FedLPPA) to uniformly leverage heterogeneous weak supervision for medical image segmentation. In FedLPPA, a learnable universal knowledge prompt is maintained, complemented by multiple learnable personalized data distribution prompts and prompts representing the supervision sparsity. Integrated with sample features through a dual-attention mechanism, those prompts empower each local task decoder to adeptly adjust to both the local distribution and the supervision form. Concurrently, a dual-decoder strategy, predicated on prompt similarity, is introduced for enhancing the generation of pseudo-labels in weakly-supervised learning, alleviating overfitting and noise accumulation inherent to local data, while an adaptable aggregation method is employed to customize the task decoder on a parameter-wise basis. Extensive experiments on three distinct medical image segmentation tasks involving different modalities underscore the superiority of FedLPPA, with its efficacy closely parallels that of fully supervised centralized training.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Medical image segmentation is a pivotal component in computer-aided diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-ups. It aims to delineate regions of interest within medical images, such as physiological structures or pathological regions, facilitating subsequent analyses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have dominated this task due to their superior performance. A multitude of studies have been introduced, primarily focusing on devising sophisticated network architectures or formulating mathematically rigorous and topology-preserving loss functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. DL methods largely benefit from large-scale fully annotated datasets which nevertheless are becoming increasingly infeasible in practical clinical contexts for two primary reasons: 1) Due to privacy and security concerns, numerous regulations and guidelines mandate the protection of patient data, limiting sharing across medical institutions (the data silo issue) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>; 2) Densely/Fully annotating a vast array of medical data is both prohibitively expensive and time-consuming since it requires specialized expertise. As the array of imaging modalities and clinical tasks proliferates, adopting sparse annotations or labeling only a fraction of the data emerges as more pragmatic approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the data silo issue, federated learning (FL) has emerged and garnered extensive attention, as it allows different centers to collaboratively train powerful deep models without the need to share or centralize their data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In standard FL paradigms, each client uses its local data to train a model and collaborates by aggregating individual local model parameters to a central server in some manner of aggregation and broadcasting the updated parameters to each individual site. For instance, the prevailing FedAvg averages models from all sites according to sample weights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, when confronted with the significant challenge of statistical heterogeneity in federated settings, despite some efforts in trying to augment the generalization of the global model through employing style augmentation or enhancing aggregation strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, studies have shown that utilizing a solitary global model rarely yields optimal results across all institutions. Such data heterogeneity is further exacerbated in medical image segmentation tasks, wherein differences in imaging equipments, protocols, patient populations, and physician expertises lead to even more diverse domain biases, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>A.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this context, personalized federated learning (pFL) proposes to learn personalized local models for individual sites to accommodate unique feature distributions or customized prediction patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Existing pFL paradigms mainly encompass approaches through local fine-tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, segmenting the network and retaining personalization layer parameters for local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, similarity-based aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, or knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, these approaches might suffer from catastrophic forgetting of public knowledge and overfitting to local distributions, inability to leverage valuable similarities from other sites, or unsuitable personalization due to coarse-grained aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Recently, prompt-based approaches have gained prominence in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, where a set of vectors, either manually set or learnt, are used as conditions for a model to better perceive contextual information such as different data distributions or downstream tasks. This allows for uniform training on heterogeneous data (different distributions, labelling forms, tasks, etc.) with only modest increases in computational costs, but is still under-researched in federated medical image segmentation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Concurrently, the pressing need to reduce annotation costs has heightened the focus on weakly supervised segmentation (WSS). WSS techniques typically leverage sparse granularity supervision (like points, boxes, scribbles, or blocks, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>B) through novel loss function designing, consistency learning, adversarial learning, or data synthesis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Integrating WSS into FL can further reduce the annotation cost per site while leveraging the benefits of FL. However, there is little research on WSS in pFL.
A more challenging but practical setup is to allow for different sites to possess different forms of weak labels, which further introduces label heterogeneity. In such context, it is highly desirable to design a unified and easy-to-deploy pFL framework for WSS settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we extend our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and propose a novel pFL framework with learnable prompt and aggregation (FedLPPA) to uniformly leverage heterogeneous weak supervision for medical image segmentation.
In FedLPPA, prompts representing universal knowledge, data distribution, and annotation sparsity are maintained, with the former two being learnable whereas the latter is manually set. These personalized prompts are fused with data representations and perceived by decoders through a dual-attention (spatial and channel) fusion mechanism. A personalized dual-decoder mechanism based on prompts’ similarity, coupled with learnable aggregation, is introduced to efficiently and adaptively generate pseudo-labels for each site, thereby facilitating WSS.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a multi-center training paradigm developed to tackle the data silo issue by training a robust global model (general FL, gFL) or multiple personalized models for individual sites (pFL) without data sharing nor centralization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In the wake of FedAvg, most gFL methods in medical image analysis mitigate the negative effects of heterogeneity through style augmentation, aggregation strategy enhancement, and disentangled representation, thereby increasing the global model’s generalizability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. However, employing a single global model is generally suboptimal; thus, pFL emerges as a more promising and flexible paradigm, customizing local models to better accommodate the unique distributions and needs of individual sites<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Existing approaches achieve this objective through local fine-tuning, model decoupling, knowledge distillation, similarity aggregation or inconsistency exploitation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.

However, this semi-suppervised FL setting is not conducive to fairness among federated sites, leading to potential free-riders (unlabeled clients). Moreover, semi-supervised learning is notably influenced by the gap between labeled and unlabeled data, not to mention the more pronounced domain shifts across different centers. Contrastive learning and masked image modelling techniques are applied to self-supervised settings under FL, yet they still demand fine-tuning under certain amounts of labeled data, and the performance gain compared to fully supervised counterparts remains slight <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.

Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, belonging to the general category of gFL, focus on bounding box labels which are hard to align with other types of weak labels (see Sec. <a href="#S2.SS2" title="II-B Weakly-supervised Segmentation ‣ II Related Work ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span></span></a>). Pan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> do not delve into leveraging various weak label forms.
In contrast, our work focuses on heterogeneous WSS in pFL and employs a learnable prompt-based in-context learning approach to differentiate and unify various annotations.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">WSS is a paradigm that trains dense segmentation models using sparse labels. Current work in WSS primarily focuses on designs for specific types of weak annotations, commonly involving image-, point-, scribble-, bounding box-, and block-wise supervision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Within this scope, image-level supervised approaches, typically reliant on classification network features like Class Activation Maps (CAMs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, are not suitable for segmenting organs and structures that are consistently presented in images, leading to exclusion of image-level annotations from our consideration. On the other hand, unlike point, scribble, or block annotations, bounding boxes supervise position and range rather than pixel categories. Methods developed for box labels typically involve constraints, priors, and network architectures that differ substantially from those for other types of weak labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, making it difficult to be accommodated nor heterogeneously utilized in a unified manner across different sites in a federated setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.

Luo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and Chai et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> each introduce a hybrid supervision framework for detecting thoracic diseases from X-rays and identifying rib fractures from CT scans. The former integrates weakly-labeled data in bounding box (Bbox) and image-level forms as well as unlabeled one, while the latter includes weakly-labeled data in Bbox and point forms as well as unlabeled one. Both are crafted for centralized settings and feature distinct network architectures and loss function designs for different supervision forms. Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> design a vessel segmentation framework based on the mean teacher paradigm, being compatible with both fully supervised and noisily supervised one. FedMix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> introduces an FL framework that is compatible with fully supervised, weakly supervised in Bbox and image-level forms, as well as unsupervised data, paralleling our research motivation. Yet, it necessitates different model and loss designs for different supervision types and overlooks domain shifts across different sites, falling within the gFL paradigm. In contrast, our goal is to develop a lightweight, unified pFL framework for all sites, accommodating all supervision forms except the less common image-level one.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first briefly overview our FedLPPA framework, then detail the Tri-prompt Dual-attention Fusion (TDF) module and the Prompt similarity Dual-decoder with Learnable Aggregation (PDLA) mechanism, which are the two key components of FedLPPA.
The former leverages in-context learning to enable the task decoders and heads to perceive common knowledge across multiple centers, local data distribution, and supervision granularity for better adaptive adjustments. The latter personalizes the auxiliary decoder’s parameters from sites with similar local distributions to mitigate noise accumulation and generate superior pseudo-labels, while learnable aggregation further personalizes the parameters of the dual-decoder.
Additionally, we describe preprocessing operations for bounding box data to align with other supervision forms.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.8" class="ltx_p">In-context learning is designed to empower networks to adaptively optimize for various contexts by employing conditions or prompts that encapsulate external factors such as scene, task, or modality. Unlike the resource-intensive visual prompts or the rigid encodings of pretrained CLIP outputs or one-hot codes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which either burden computation and privacy or miss cross-client insights, we employ a triple-latent-prompt strategy. This approach integrates universal knowledge, data distribution, and annotation sparsity, effectively merging learnable parameters with predefined one-hot encodings for a more nuanced and efficient response. Concretely, all clients jointly maintain two learnable parameters: the universal knowledge prompt (UKP) <math id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p_{U}\in\mathbb{R}^{1\times H\times W}"

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In WSS, an effective strategy is to generate reliable pseudo-proposals for unlabeled areas. To reduce local computational overhead, we forgo the multi-level tree affinity approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. An alternative is self-training using the model’s own predictions, which is nevertheless prone to update stagnation and noise accumulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. To mitigate these issues, we adopt a dual-decoder strategy wherein an auxiliary branch incorporates beneficial information from other centers. In the PDLA mechanism, parameter acquisition for both decoders involves two stages: aggregation or selection at the server side, and learnable aggregation at the local end.</p>

FedAvg computes a weighted average of the parameters from each local model, based on the sample size, to obtain a singular global model. FedProx is an extension of FedAvg, incorporating a proximal term into optimization to address system heterogeneity, thereby enhancing stability and performance in heterogeneous environments. In pFL methods, FT represents FedAvg with site fine-tuning. FedBN and FedRep respectively treat all batch normalization (BN) layers and the task head (e.g., the final convolutional layer) as the personalized components of the model. FedAP aggregates through BN layer statistics to assess similarities across sites, while preserving individualized parameters of each site’s BN layers. MetaFed achieves personalization for each site through static (fixed order) cyclic knowledge distillation. FedALA employs an adaptive local aggregation module to facilitate knowledge transfer between the global model and local ones, thereby realizing personalization. FedLC achieves personalization by employing local calibrations that leverage inconsistencies at both the feature- and prediction levels. FedICRA accommodates the same setting as this paper by utilizing one-hot prompts and novel objective functions for WSS.
Considering that some of the above methods are initially designed for classification, we endeavor to preserve their original design tenets while adapting them for segmentation tasks. All comparison methods, being consistent with FedLPPA, are trained under a WSS setting on the same datasets described in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS1" title="IV-A Datasets and Preprocessing ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-A</span></span></a> . Additionally, comparisons are made with some baselines and ideal setups, including local training (LT) and centralized training (CT) with weak and full labels. All methods are evaluated using two metrics: the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95 [px]).</p>

The <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Overall</span> columns demonstrate that compared to LT, all FL methods enhance the overall segmentation performance across all sites. Sites C and E achieve significant performance improvements after participating in FL, as their diverse local data distributions make it challenging for them to train sufficiently robust models using only local data. Site D also experiences a notable performance increase after joining FL, due to its use of point annotations, where the supervisory signals are insufficient for training an adequate model. Due to the high data heterogeneity among sites in the fundus scenario, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-D4 Affinity Matrix Analysis ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies and Analyses ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>A, pFL methods, which train personalized models for different sites, typically achieve higher performance than gFL methods. FedAP and FedICRA achieve notable performance, while FedLPPA further enhances it. All clients benefit within our framework, showing significant superiority over CL (weak) and closely approaching CL (full) in the overall performance.</p>

Some pFL methods (like FedBN, FedAP, FedRep, and MetaFed), due to inappropriate or coarse-grained personalization, even underperform typical gFL methods like FedAvg and FedProx. Benefiting from the proposed TDF module which enables in-context learning for adaptive adjustments to different scenarios, and the PDLA mechanism, FedLPPA can make fine-grained personalized adjustments. Further, FedLPPA enables each client model to perceive different scenarios in an in-context learning manner and make finer-grained personalized adjustments. As a result, it achieves superior performance in various data heterogeneity tasks. Notably, in the FAZ segmentation task, FedLPPA significantly outperforms other FL methods and comes very close to the performance under the CT (full) setting. It is also worth mentioning that in the Polyp segmentation scenario, FedLPPA not only greatly surpasses its competitors but also exceeds the CT (full) setting by 4.6% in DSC, fully demonstrating the potential of WSS combined with FL. Visualization results for the three tasks are provided in

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To delve deeper into FedLPPA, we perform ablations on the TDF module and the PDLA mechanism, where PDLA is divided into two parts: Prompt similarity Dual-decoder (PD, conducted on the server side) and Learnable Aggregation (LA, carried out on the client side). Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies and Analyses ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> presents the quantitative results of the main ablation studies across the three tasks. The first row represents the baseline, indicating a reduction to the classic FedAvg by removing the three components. The prompts in the TDF module are a prerequisite for acquiring the parameters of the auxiliary decoder. Hence, by initially integrating this module, a certain degree of performance improvement can be observed across all three tasks. In the primary ablation experiments, PD employs the <span id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Prompt similarity aggregated</span> strategy mentioned in Sec. <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C PDLA Mechanism and WSS Objective ‣ III Method ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>. The inclusion of PD further significantly enhances performance on the previously established basis. The combination of the LA mechanism with TDF also yields commendable performance, but due to the absence of a dual-decoder to obtain reliable pseudo-proposals, it is not as effective as the TDF and PD combination on the ODOC and FAZ tasks (notably, a higher HD95 indicates a larger number of outlier predictions). With all three components integrated, the optimal performance is achieved, underscoring the indispensability of each component.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Given that the original triple prompts consist of only a limited number of bits, simply concatenating the prompts with sample features and processing them through several convolutional layers often proves inadequate for effective feature fusion and enhancement. Consequently, the effectiveness of the dual attention fusion block is further explored. Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-D2 Ablation Studies of TDF ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies and Analyses ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> demonstrates that variants without any specific type of feature fusion nor enhancement achieve lower results in most metrics across the three tasks. Implementing either channel attention (CA) fusion or spatial attention (SA) fusion generally leads to performance improvements in most cases. However, exceptions are noted, such as that on the ODOC task where only using CA results in a performance decline.
This could be attributed to the high data heterogeneity across different centers, where each local model is already capable of making personalized adjustments to various features, and the relatively coarse granularity of CA alone leads to a slight performance reduction. Yet, the application of dual attention fusion for feature enhancement consistently yields the best results in both types of metrics across the three tasks. This underscores the necessity of finer-grained modulation, fusion and enhancement of the triple prompts with sample features.</p>

These strategies include <span id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Random</span> (RO), <span id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fixed order</span> (FO), <span id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Highest prompt similarity</span> (HPS), and <span id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Prompt similarity aggregated</span> (PSA, used as the default). In this subsection, we first explore the performance of these strategies and present the results in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-D3 Comparisons of Server-side Auxiliary Decoder Parameter Selection Strategies ‣ IV-D Ablation Studies and Analyses ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
The figure shows that the performance differences among the four strategies are not very significant across the three tasks. However, the PSA strategy consistently achieves the best performance in all scenarios. This is because the other three strategies only utilize information from a single separate client, while PSA aggregates and utilizes information from multiple similar sites based on prompt-calculated similarity. It also filters out information from dissimilar sites.</p>

From the corresponding t-SNE and affinity matrices, strong correlation between data heterogeneity and affinity degree is observed. For example, in the ODOC task, where data heterogeneity among clients is high, the corresponding matrix shows lower similarity values and has zeros (indicating dissimilar clients). In contrast, in the FAZ and Polyp scenarios, where data heterogeneity is lower, the values in the affinity matrices are higher, especially in the Polyp task. The Polyp data has the least heterogeneity and all values in the corresponding affinity matrix are greater than 0.5. Furthermore, although not strictly corresponding, the relative distribution/relationship of data features in t-SNE and the similarities obtained from FedLPPA demonstrate a high degree of correlation, validating the effectiveness of using prompts to calculate similarities among multi-center data. Additionally, in conjunction with the results in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS3" title="IV-C Comparisons with State-of-the-art ‣ IV Experiments ‣ FedLPPA: Learning Personalized Prompt and Aggregation for Federated Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span></span></a>, it clearly illustrates that FedLPPA effectively achieves personalization under various data heterogeneity scenarios, demonstrating its broad applicability, generalizability and robust performance.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel personalized FL framework, FedLPPA, for tackling a practical but challenging federated heterogeneous WSS problem. A TDF module and a PDLA mechanism are introduced to enable in-context learning and fine-grained personalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on three medical image segmentation tasks, with superiority of FedLPPA being successfully established. Additionally, we have shown that under heterogeneous WSS conditions, FedLPPA can achieve segmentation performance that is comparable to that of labor-intensive fully-supervised centralized training.</p>
