<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models, with model communication replacing direct data uploading. While over-the-air model aggregation improves communication efficiency, uploading models to an edge server over wireless networks can pose privacy risks. Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used quantitative technique to measure statistical data privacy in FL. Previous research has focused on over-the-air FL with a single-antenna server, leveraging communication noise to enhance user-level DP. This approach achieves the so-called "free DP" by controlling transmit power rather than introducing additional DP-preserving mechanisms at devices, such as adding artificial noise.
In this paper, we study differentially private over-the-air FL over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channel. We show that FL model communication with a multiple-antenna server amplifies privacy leakage when the multiple-antenna server employs separate receive combining for model aggregation and information inference. Consequently, relying solely on communication noise, as done in the multiple-input single-output system, cannot meet high privacy requirements, and a device-side privacy-preserving mechanism is necessary for optimal DP design. We analyze the learning convergence and privacy loss of the studied FL system and propose a transceiver design algorithm based on alternating optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better privacy-learning trade-off compared to prior work.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications that leverage massive data generated at the edge of wireless networks has attracted widespread interest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">8808168</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">TaskOri6GMag</span>]</cite>. Federate learning (FL) is a popular paradigm for exploiting edge devices’ data and computation power for distributed machine learning. FL coordinates the distributive training of an AI model on edge devices by periodically sharing model information with an edge server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FEDSGD</span>]</cite>. At the outset, FL appeared to be a promising solution that improves communication efficiency and safeguards data privacy, since on-device data is retained locally and only AI models are communicated. However, recent research indicates that the efficiency of FL is constrained by several challenges, including large communication delays and privacy leakage risks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_Challenge</span>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The iterative uploading of high-dimensional local models from massive devices has been identified as the critical bottleneck in FL training. Existing communication standards are shown to be inadequate to support frequent model exchange in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">GZhu_BroadbandAircomp</span>]</cite>. To expedite model uploading, over-the-air computation has been introduced to FL model aggregation. This technique enables devices to concurrently transmit their local gradients by exploiting the superposition property of a multiple-access channel. Pioneering research on over-the-air FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">GZhu_BroadbandAircomp</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_Digital1</span>]</cite> aligned local models at a single-antenna server by channel-inversion-based transmit scaling. Moreover, over-the-air model aggregation was studied with a multiple-antenna receiver to leverage high array gains of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_1</span>]</cite>. The design of MIMO over-the-air transceivers requires the joint optimization of transmit scaling and uniform receive beamforming, which can be attained sub-optimally by iterative algorithms, such as semi-definite relaxation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_2</span>]</cite>, difference-of-convex (DC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_1</span>]</cite>, and successive convex approximation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">liu2020reconfigurable</span>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from the challenges in model communication, the exchange of local models or gradients during FL iterations reveals surprisingly much private information on local data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">8737416</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">8835269</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">See_grad</span>]</cite>. For example, a malicious server can exploit the received gradients to recover sensitive on-device training images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">See_grad</span>]</cite>. Differential privacy (DP) has been a well-documented quantitative measure of privacy disclosure in machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DP_Book</span>]</cite>, which quantifies the probability that an individual data sample can be distinguished from its neighborhoods in a local dataset.
Owing to its robust composition theorems, DP has been identified as a powerful tool in dissecting the privacy-learning trade-off in iterative training of FL, thereby simplifying the subsequent system optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">abadi2016deep</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9069945</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">TMC_DP</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9174426</span>]</cite>.
To maintain DP in FL, local models are typically perturbed by adding random noise before release <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">abadi2016deep</span>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9069945</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">TMC_DP</span>]</cite>, the authors leveraged Gaussian artificial noise to preserve DP in FL, often referred to as the Gaussian mechanism, where lossless model communication over an orthogonal multiple-access channel was considered. Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9174426</span>]</cite> extended the Gaussian mechanism to over-the-air FL and reported a fundamental <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">learning-privacy trade-off</em>. Specifically, adding large artificial noise to achieve high privacy levels leads to significant distortion in over-the-air model aggregation, which compromises training convergence. It was further noted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9174426</span>]</cite> that over-the-air model aggregation achieves stronger privacy protection than the orthogonal communication protocol, as artificial noises from all local users are superposed at the receiver.
On the other hand, instead of leveraging additional artificial noise, one can harness inherent communication noise at a single-antenna server to preserve DP, such that arbitrary user privacy levels can be satisfied by solely reducing transmit power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DPFL_DLiu</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9322199</span>]</cite>.
Inspired by this, Refs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DPFL_DLiu</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9322199</span>]</cite> proposed to transmit power control algorithms that attain accurate FL training while satisfying given DP requirements. Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DPFL_RIS</span>]</cite> further balanced the learning-privacy trade-off by reconfigurable intelligent surface. The communication-noise-based DP mechanism was enhanced by incorporating additional perturbations in wireless FL systems, such as inherent anonymity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9413624</span>]</cite>, user sub-sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9562556</span>]</cite>, multi-cell interference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9580422</span>]</cite>, hardware-induced distortion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">hardware_dp</span>]</cite>, and gradient quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">QUANTIZE_dp</span>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The current research on DP-constrained over-the-air FL focuses on model aggregation with a single-antenna server, i.e., model uploading over a multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel. The edge devices can preserve DP through optimal power control in local gradient transmission, without the need of injecting artificial noise, even for high DP requirements. This leads to what is called <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">free DP with zero artificial noise</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DPFL_DLiu</span>]</cite>.
On the other hand, the MIMO technique, which can improve spectral efficiency by deploying a large antenna array at the server, is a crucial feature in current and future wireless protocols <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">6736761</span>]</cite>. MIMO-based over-the-air FL is capable of improving the learning performance by leveraging high array gains to achieve more accurate model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_1</span>]</cite>. In this regard, it is necessary to investigate the feasibility of achieving DP in MIMO-based over-the-air FL to accommodate the state-of-the-art network architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, extending the MISO-based FL design with DP constraints to MIMO systems is not straightforward, due to the coupling effect between the model aggregation protocol and the privacy-preserving mechanism. The corresponding transceiver design challenge is three-fold. First, the privacy leakage in receiving local gradients differs across the server’s antennas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Hang_mag</span>]</cite>. This makes it possible for an untrustworthy server to exploit separate receive combining strategies for model aggregation and information inference. Designing an optimal information inference mechanism is, however, challenging due to the intractability of privacy loss during the iterative model exchange. Second, model aggregation with the multiple-antenna server is more vulnerable to privacy risks, necessitating a more stringent DP-preserving mechanism on the device side. Third, it is unclear whether the MIMO system can always achieve free DP without inducing artificial noise, as has been verified in the MISO system.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we study the transceiver design for differentially private over-the-air FL over a MIMO fading channel.

We aim to maximize the learning convergence rate while satisfying given DP constraints at the devices.
