<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" lang="en">Traditional federated learning uses the number of samples to calculate the weights of each client model and uses this fixed weight value to fusion the global model. However, in practical scenarios, each client’s device and data heterogeneity leads to differences in the quality of each client’s model. Thus the contribution to the global model is not wholly determined by the sample size. In addition, if clients intentionally upload low-quality or malicious models, using these models for aggregation will lead to a severe decrease in global model accuracy. Traditional federated learning algorithms do not address these issues.
To solve this probelm, we propose FedDRL, a model fusion approach using reinforcement learning based on a two staged approach. In the first stage, Our method could filter out malicious models and selects trusted client models to participate in the model fusion. In the second stage, the FedDRL algorithm adaptively adjusts the weights of the trusted client models and aggregates the optimal global model. We also define five model fusion scenarios and compare our method with two baseline algorithms in those scenarios. The experimental results show that our algorithm has higher reliability than other algorithms while maintaining accuracy.</span></p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of deep learning technologies, numerous industries are applying them to their respective fields, resulting in the emergence of intelligent transportation, smart logistics, and smart healthcare models. These technologies reduce the industry’s production and management costs, increase operational efficiency, and accelerate the industry’s digitization process. However, most current deep learning-based model training uses a supervised learning method. The number and diversity of samples is the key to training a high-quality model. Therefore, how to obtain massive and diverse data samples has become the first step to training deep learning models. This method leads to the source of these samples being no longer limited to a single industry but to multiple industries collaborating to construct large-scale datasets.
Moreover, with the emergence of cross-industry collaborative data analysis models, data analysis sources are no longer limited to a single organization but involve multiple parties. Although the participation of multiple parties in the data analysis process can solve the problem of cross-domain data analysis, this strategy also faces a new challenge. The traditional data analysis method requires uploading each participant’s raw data to a central node and training models on the central node. However, this workflow involving raw data transfer poses security and privacy risks. Meanwhile, raw data transmission is not permitted for data-sensitive industries, such as hospital patient and financial industry data. How to achieve federated data analysis of multiple parties while protecting data security is becoming hot research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an emerging paradigm for distributed computing. The structure of federated learning has a central node and multiple participants, where multiple participants train models with their private data, and the central node achieves knowledge extraction and information fusion of each participant by fusing the models uploaded by each client. Since the process does not directly use the participants’ data, federated learning can achieve joint data analysis of multiple participants while protecting user privacy in advance.
To solve mobile device word input privacy protection issues, Google proposed federated learning and the FedAvg method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which ensure user privacy by transmitting models instead of raw data. Increasingly, companies are applying federated learning in various domains to tackle cross-industry data analysis challenges. However, in practical federated learning environments, the heterogeneity of data among participants gives rise to the non-iid problem, which makes model convergence challenging during the fusion stage of the FedAvg method. Additionally, variations in computational resources among participants lead to slow convergence of the global model.
To address these challenges, some research has optimized the global model convergence problem by adding control parameters in the client-side model fusion process, such as FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Scaffold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The Moon algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> optimizes the convergence of the global model by introducing a comparative loss between the client-side model and the global model.
There is also some research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to improve the accuracy of the global model by selecting the clients involved in the global model.
These algorithms somewhat solve the global model’s convergence problem in the non-iid data among participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Current traditional federal learning methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, use a ratio based on the number of samples of each participant to the total number of samples to calculate the model weights of each participant. However, in a practical scenario, the method has two problems. On the one hand: the method does not consider the different participants’ model quality, which gives higher weights to the client with a larger number of samples.
However, due to the variability of computational resources and sample quality across clients, it does not mean that a client can train a higher-quality model when a client has more samples. Therefore, using these algorithms assumes that the sample quality and computational resources are consistent across clients.
On the other hand, if the participants have malicious attack behavior and intentionally upload malicious models to participate in fusion, which will seriously influence the global model convergence process. Therefore it becomes increasingly important to design adaptive defenses for federated learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. How to eliminate malicious models in federated learning model fusion has become a vital issue. At the same time, when the client uploads low-quality models to participate in fusion, how to adaptively adjust each model’s fusion weights based on the models’ quality is also an urgent problem to be solved.
Some research has used reinforcement learning methods to address these issues of weighting. Such as, Favor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> method uses the DDPG to calculate the weights of the participant models.
Some research has also used reinforcement learning to solve the problems of device selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, resource optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and communication optimization in IoT federated learning scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning (RL) methods use a try-and-learn strategy. The core of the reinforcement learning approach is to train an intelligent agent. The agent uses different actions to interact with the external environment. The environment provides reward and punishment values based on the selected actions of the intelligence. The intelligent body achieves optimal action selection by maximizing the reward value.
However, when we use reinforcement learning, we must address some issues. On the one hand, we must collect training samples by continuously interacting with the environment. When the cost of interacting with the external environment is too high, or the interaction cost is unacceptable (e.g., driverless scenario), how to collect samples quickly will directly affect the training time of reinforcement learning. On the other hand, when the action space of the agent is high-latitude and continuous, this will lead to an increasing sampling time.
Therefore, due to these two problems, traditional single-agent reinforcement learning training methods can take much time.
When we apply reinforcement learning to federated learning, we must solve those problems. As the number of participants grows, the time cost of training agents will increase. How to optimize the action space for reinforcement learning and speed up the training process of the agent is an urgent problem to be solved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, we propose a staged reinforcement learning algorithm (FedDRL) to solve the problem of model weight calculation in federated learning. The algorithm consists of two phases: the selection of trusted clients and the adaptive assignment of weights. We use a staged approach to accelerate the agent’s training. We use a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to speed up the collection of training samples. The contributions of this paper is as follows.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Research of federated learning focuses on solving three problems: how to improve generalization of the global model on the server side, how to personalize the model on the client side.Therefore, Federated learning can be divided into server-side and client-side optimization algorithms. Google first proposed the FedAvg method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> to solve the server-side global model fusion problem . However, the client in the actual scenario has device and sample heterogeneity problems, which can lead to global model convergence problems in the FedAvg method. To optimize the global model convergence problem, Karimireddy et al. proposed the Scaffold algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which accelerates the convergence of the global model by introducing a control variable to correct the client-side drift problem. Li et al. proposed the FedProx algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which implements the correction of deviated clients by adding the regularization function to the client model. Wang et al. proposed the FedNova algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which solves the global model convergence problem by normalizing the parameters on both the client and server sides. Li et al. also proposed the MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> method based on model comparison learning, which solves the global model convergence problem by calculating the similarity between the global model and the client model and continuously decreasing the distance representation of both to achieve the training of the client-side model.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Non-IID problem is the key that leads to the convergence of the federated learning model. Zhao et al. study the performance of different federated learning methods on the Non-IID dataset and experimentally demonstrate that the Non-IID problem poses a significant challenge to the accuracy of the federated learning algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Therefore some research focuses on solving the Non-IID problem of federated learning. For example, Zhang et al. proposed the FedPD method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which offers strategies that can handle non-convex objective functions to optimize models and communication. In addition, Gong et al. proposed the AutoCFL method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which adaptively adjusts the number of training rounds for the client while introducing weighted voting of the client clustering strategy to eliminate the effects of Non-IID and imbalanced data.
Huang et al. proposed the FedAMP method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which solves the client-side model personalization problem caused by Non-IID data by implementing a personalized update of the client-side model.
Li et al. proposed the Fedbn method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which adds a batch normalization layer to the local model to solve the problem of feature shift in data heterogeneity.
Briggs et al. proposed a hierarchical clustering approach (FL+HC)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which optimizes the model’s performance on Non-IID datasets by training clients in groups and then having each group trained independently on a dedicated model. Furthermore, Gao et al. proposed the Feddc method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which addresses the data heterogeneity problem by bridging the gap between client and global model parameters through a control variable. Finally, mu et al. proposed the Fedproc method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which guides the client model training by introducing a loss of comparison between the client model and the global model, thus enabling the global model to perform well on Non-IID data to achieve good performance.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since reinforcement learning has the advantage of adaptive learning, some research applies reinforcement learning to federated learning.
Some research focuses on improving the performance of global models based on reinforcement learning methods. Such as Wang et al. proposed the Favor method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which adaptively selects clients participating in the model fusion. Sun et al. also proposed the PG-FFL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which can solve the problem of calculating client weights during model fusion.
Some work uses reinforcement learning to solve device optimization problems in a federated IoT environment. such as Zhang et al. uses the DDPG method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> to achieve the selection of optimal devices.
Zhang proposed the FedMarl algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which uses Multi-agent reinforcement learning to achieve node selection in federated learning.
Yang et al. also proposed a digital twin architecture (DTEI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which uses reinforcement learning methods to solve the device selection problem.
Some research focus on solving the resource optimization and scheduling problem in IoT environment. Zhang et al. proposed the RoF approach<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which achieves optimal resource scheduling based on multi-intelligent reinforcement learning.
Rjoub et al. designed a trusted device selection method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> based on a reinforcement learning approach to achieve resource scheduling.
Rjoub et al. proposed the DDQN-Trust method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which uses the Q-learning approach to evaluate the credit scores of devices to achieve optimal scheduling.
To optimize the communication problem of federated learning, Yang et al. proposed a reinforcement learning-based model evaluation method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> to participate in model training and model fusion by selecting the optimal devices.
Most current research uses reinforcement learning to solve federated learning problems in IoT environments. These include optimal device selection, resource optimization, and communication optimization.
Some work uses reinforcement learning methods to solve the client-side weight assignment problem in federated learning. However, most of these methods are based on single-agent training methods and need to address the training time overhead of reinforcement learning.</p>

The traditional method of calculating this weight in federal learning is determined by the ratio of the number of samples of the client to the total number of samples. This means that the larger the number of samples corresponding to the client, the larger the weight assigned. However, in the actual environment, due to the heterogeneity of the client data and the computing resources, it is impossible to determine the weights by the ratio of the number of samples for each client. Therefore, we need to solve two problems.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To solve these two problems, we need an adaptive weight calculation method that can set the weight of the malicious model to 0, which means that malicious models are prohibited from participating in the fusion process. At the same time, we realize the adaptive assignment of weights to each client and try to increase the weights of high-quality client models so that the global model gets the optimal accuracy rate.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">If we use the single-agent reinforcement learning approach to solve the above problems, we face another issue again. On the one hand, the action space of the agent can be huge as the number of fused clients increases, which also leads to a long time required to train the agent model. On the other hand, a single agent method can only interact with a single environment, and that sampling process takes a long time. We solve these two problems in two steps by borrowing the idea of hierarchical reinforcement learning, which can solve the problem of the long training time of reinforcement learning. These two stages are selecting trusted clients and the optimal weight assignment process.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">Why do we use a phased approach to reinforce learning? Let’s use an example to illustrate the reason for using it. We need a robot to learn the cooking process using a reinforcement learning approach. The cooking steps are divided into three stages: washing, chopping, and cooking. The robot needs to learn the best actions to cook a good dish. Traditional reinforcement learning is to find the best action that satisfies all three stages at the same time. However, if the robot does not wash the vegetables well, it cannot cook a good dish in the subsequent stages either. Therefore, it is a complete waste of time to try the next step of action if the optimal action of the previous stage is not learned. If the robot learns in multiple stages, it first learns the optimal action in the cleaning process and then proceeds to the next step of learning the optimal action. This will save time and make it easier to get the best solution.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, if the malicious models are not screened and the weight assignment method is used for malicious models, it will increase the cost of trial and error time in the reinforcement learning process. Therefore, we screen the trusted clients for weight assignment by a staged approach. This can exclude the trial and error cost of malicious models involved in weight assignment, thus optimizing the action space. Also, we use distributed reinforcement learning methods to increase the sampling speed and thus reduce the time overhead of training reinforcement learning. We will describe the implementation of each step in detail in the next section.</p>

To achieve this purpose, we randomly choose several models to fusion the global model and evaluate the accuracy of global models. If a malicious model is selected to participate in the fusion, the accuracy of the global model will be very low. If only trusted clients are selected to participate in the fusion, the accuracy of the global model will also increase.

Each worker contains an Actor and a Critic network, where the Actor-network generates action A, and the Critic network evaluates the action and gives the corresponding reward. Meanwhile, each worker independently interacts with the related environment to achieve sampling and training of the Actor and Critic networks. In addition, the Actor and Critic networks of the central node are used to synchronize the network information of each worker and to achieve the fusion and sharing of network parameters of multiple workers.</p>

In this phase, our main objective is to achieve the optimal weight assignment for each model. Since the weight values of the client models correspond to a continuous action space, we use the TD3 algorithm to accomplish this process. For each communication round in federation learning, we assume that K plausible client models are screened in the previous stage, where the parameters of the client models are set. The number of samples corresponding to the clients is defined as. These two terms are fixed in each federal communication round.
We need to assign the weight values corresponding to each model to the k models based on the quality of the models, which is defined. We validate the accuracy Acc of each model based on the retained data.
We need to train the reinforcement learning intelligences in each communication round of federation learning and achieve the global model fusion by assigning the optimal model weights by this intelligences. The process is described as follows.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We use multiple parallel environments to accelerate the sampling to speed up the training agent in this phase. The stage is shown in figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.2 Trusted Client Selection Method ‣ 3 Method ‣ FedDRL: A Trustworthy Federated Learning Model Fusion Method Based on Staged Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. This stage includes a central Learner and multiple Worker nodes. Each Worker corresponds to a parallel environment. The workflow of each Worker is as follows: first, each Worker performs global model fusion based on the assigned weights; then verifies the accuracy of the global model by interacting with the parallel environment; and finally receives the reward values from the parallel environment feedback. Finally, each Worker stores the corresponding ones in the sampling buffer pool. Multiple workers interact with each environment independently, thus achieving parallel sampling to improve the sampling efficiency. After each worker collects a certain batch of samples, Learner trains the agent by taking a certain amount of sample data from the experience pool.</p>

The Dirichlet function could simulate the data partitioning of each client by setting the alpha parameter. When the alpha parameter tends to zero, the data distribution of clients is assigned to only a certain class of the public dataset; when the alpha parameter tends to positive infinity, the closer the distribution of client data, which is the amount and class of data is consistent across clients. To simulate the distribution of non-iid data, we set alpha to 1 to split the three datasets into ten clients.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">According to the experimental setup, we compared the FedDRL algorithm with the two baseline algorithms. In the attack experiments, we set the total number of communication rounds to 100 rounds, and each node performs local model training with 1 epoch. To show the attack behavior of each client and the accuracy of different algorithms in each attack scenario in more detail, we counted the accuracy of each client’s local model and the accuracy of the server-side global model in each communication round. The specific experimental results are shown in table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2.1 Malicious Client Attack Experiment ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 EXPERIMENT ‣ FedDRL: A Trustworthy Federated Learning Model Fusion Method Based on Staged Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

In the attack type 3 scenario, our algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithm in most cases, especially when multiple malicious clients are involved in model fusion.
To show the relationship between the global and client model’s accuracy in each attack scenario. We conducted more detailed experiments on the Cifar10 dataset.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To validate the performance of our proposed algorithm FedDRL, we performed validation on three datasets, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Since all three are open source, these data are high-quality data. Therefore each client used these sample data to train their respective models, and these models did not exhibit significant accuracy differences. We set up the following experiments to verify the impact of low-quality models involved in global model fusion in a real-world scenario.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">(1) To verify the impact of different numbers of customer nodes on the algorithm, we conducted experiments on three datasets with 5, 10, and 15 clients, respectively.

At the beginning of each round of federated learning, these clients initialize the local model using the global model. After several rounds of communication, when the accuracy of the local model reaches a certain accuracy, we simulate the participation of low-quality models in global model fusion by controlling the accuracy of these client models (e.g., model accuracy is kept between 50% and 60%). These clients upload low-quality models to the server side.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the FedAvg, FedProx, and FedDRL algorithms for global model fusion at each communication round. We have taken the CIFAR10 dataset as an example and conducted experimental comparisons with 5, 10, and 15 clients, respectively. The experimental results of each algorithm are shown in Figure <a href="#S5.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 5.2.3 Hybrid experiment ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 EXPERIMENT ‣ FedDRL: A Trustworthy Federated Learning Model Fusion Method Based on Staged Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The comparison experiments of CIFAR-10 show that the performance of FedAvg and FedProx algorithms keeps decreasing as the number of low-quality models involved in fusion increases. Also, these two algorithms fluctuate up and down with the accuracy of the low-quality models due to the number of samples used by these two algorithms to calculate the global model. Therefore, when the weight value of the model is fixed, the change in the accuracy of the model affects the change in the accuracy of the global model. Meanwhile, FedDRL has a faster convergence speed than both FedAvg and FedProx algorithms because the FedDRL algorithm can adjust the corresponding weights adaptively according to the quality of each client model, which mitigates the impact of low-quality models on the accuracy of the global model and thus accelerates the convergence speed of the global model to a certain extent.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The hybrid scenario experiments show that the FedAvg and FedProx algorithms can no longer perform global model fusion properly due to the attack behavior of the client. Meanwhile, malicious models’ involvement in the global model fusion makes the accuracy of the global model based on the traditional algorithm very low. In the FedDRL algorithm, we adopt the two-stage method. In the first stage, we eliminate malicious models from participating in a fusion. We use an adaptive weight fusion strategy in the second stage, reducing low-quality models’ influence. Thus our algorithms work correctly even in this hybrid scenario. The global model and the model accuracy of each client for each communication round of these three algorithms are shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.2.3 Hybrid experiment ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 EXPERIMENT ‣ FedDRL: A Trustworthy Federated Learning Model Fusion Method Based on Staged Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We analyze the experimental results for different model fusion scenarios as well as for different numbers of client models. In the client-side attack experiments, under attack type 1, our algorithm works better than the FedAvg method on all three datasets. Meanwhile, as the number of malicious nodes increases, the global model accuracy of both FedAvg and FedProx algorithms shows a serious decrease. In contrast, our algorithm still maintains a smooth convergence trend.
Under attack type 2, our algorithm is better than the FedAvg algorithm and slightly lower than the FedProx algorithm. Under attack type 3, our algorithm outperforms the edAvg and FedProx algorithms on all three datasets, which no longer work under rotating attacks with multiple malicious clients. In contrast, our algorithm can work reliably.
In the low-quality model experiments, our algorithm outperforms the FedAvg and FedProx algorithms on all three datasets.
In the hybrid experiments, the FedAvg and FedProx algorithms no longer work properly, and our algorithm can fuse the global models properly.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since the FedAvg and FedProx methods use the number of samples to calculate the model weights, they cannot adaptively adjust the responses of malicious and low-quality models. They thus cannot be applied to these attack scenarios. Our proposed method is based on staged reinforcement learning for malicious node removal and optimal weight assignment for trusted clients and thus can work reliably in various environments.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the problem of assigning client weights due to data heterogeneity in a federated learning environment. We propose FedDRL, an adaptive weight calculation method based on staged reinforcement learning. The method comprises two stages: selecting trusted clients and adaptive weight assignment. In the first stage, our approach can eliminate malicious client models from participating in the global model fusion. It also can dynamically select trusted client models to participate in the next stage of model weight assignment. In the second stage, Our method can adaptively calculate the corresponding weights based on the model quality of each client. Also, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning method to accelerate the agent’s training. Finally, we proposed five types of model fusion scenarios to validate our approach, and experiments show that our proposed algorithm can work reliably in all kinds of model fusion scenarios while maintaining the accuracy of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, our algorithm requires separate training of the agent according to the client fusion scenarios. In future work, we will extend the proposed algorithm to accommodate model fusion tasks for different task scenarios. We will also continue improving the algorithm’s performance to achieve more client tasks.</p>
