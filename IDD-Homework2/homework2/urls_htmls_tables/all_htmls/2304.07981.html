<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Incentive mechanism is crucial for federated learning (FL) when rational clients do not have the same interests in the global model as the server. However, due to system heterogeneity and limited budget, it is generally impractical for the server to incentivize all clients to participate in all training rounds (known as full participation).
The existing FL incentive mechanisms are typically designed by
stimulating <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a fixed subset of clients</em> based on their data quantity or system resources. Hence, FL is performed only using this subset of clients throughout the entire training process, leading to a <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">biased model because of data heterogeneity</em>. This paper proposes a game-theoretic incentive mechanism for FL with <em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">randomized client participation</em>, where the server adopts a customized pricing strategy that motivates different clients to join with different <em id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">participation levels (probabilities)</em> for obtaining an <em id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">unbiased</em> and high-performance model. Each client responds to the server’s monetary incentive by choosing its best participation level, to maximize its profit based on not only the incurred local cost but also its <em id="id1.id1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">intrinsic value</em> for the global model. To effectively evaluate clients’ contribution to the model performance, we derive a new convergence bound which analytically predicts how clients’ arbitrary participation levels and their heterogeneous data affect the model performance. By solving a non-convex optimization problem, our analysis reveals that the intrinsic value leads to the interesting possibility of <em id="id1.id1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">bi-directional payment</em> between the server and clients. Experimental results using real datasets on a hardware prototype demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism in achieving higher model performance for the server as well as higher profits for the clients.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as an attractive distributed machine learning paradigm, which
enables many clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model under the coordination of a central server, while keeping the training data private <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In FL, each client exploits its local dataset to compute a local model update, and the server periodically aggregates these local model updates to obtain a global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Because clients and the server in FL usually belong to different entities, clients may not have as much interest in obtaining a high-performance model (i.e., higher accuracy and lower loss) as the server. For instance, a company could adopt the FL framework to train a commercial model by letting its customers train the model with their local data and on their own devices, while the customers (clients) may not be interested in the model.
Hence, without sufficient compensation, clients may not be willing to participate due to the associated local cost (e.g., resource consumption for computation and communication),
which makes the incentive mechanism design crucial in FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, designing an efficient and effective incentive mechanism for FL is challenging due to two unique FL features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>:
1) clients in FL systems are usually massively distributed with different local resources and independent availability (known as <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">system heterogeneity</em>);
2) the training data
are unbalanced and non-i.i.d. across the clients (known as <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">statistical/data heterogeneity</em>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to system heterogeneity, it is generally impractical to design an incentive mechanism for FL that requires all clients to participate in <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">all training rounds</em> (known as full client participation). This is because FL usually involves a large number of clients and multiple training rounds, and incentivizing full client participation requires a considerable monetary compensation, which may be beyond the server’s budget. Moreover, clients may be only intermittently available due to their usage patterns, which prevents them from participating in every training round. </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the existing studies (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>), incentive mechanism with partial client participation mainly stimulate a <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">deterministic</em> (fixed) subset of “valuable” clients based on their data quantity, computation or communication resources, where FL is performed only using this subset of clients throughout the entire training process. However, these mechanisms may result in a severely <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">biased model</em> because of statistical heterogeneity (e.g., the data at incentivized clients may not be representative of all clients’ data), which <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fails to converge to the optimal model that would be obtained if all the clients participate in training</em>. Therefore, we are motivated to study the first key challenging question:
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Question 1:</span> <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">How to design a practical incentive mechanism for FL with partial client participation, to ensure the convergence to a globally optimal unbiased model?</em></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In tackling the bias issue due to partial client participation, recent works have proposed various client sampling and model aggregation algorithms (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>), where the clients are presumed to be always active (available) upon the server’s request. This assumption may not always hold in practice, as clients are independent decision-makers with different local interests.
This motivates us to explore the role of <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clients’ independent
participation levels (probabilities)</em> in incentive mechanism design, where the server offers monetary rewards to stimulate all clients to join with desired participation levels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">From the server’s perspective, intuitively, it can achieve a higher model performance if all clients participate at higher levels, whereas the resulting payment may be beyond the limited budget.
In addition, due to statistical heterogeneity, clients with higher participation levels may have low data quality (e.g., small datasize or skewed data distribution) and thus have little contribution to the model performance.
Therefore, it is critical to design an efficient payment strategy
where clients who contribute more towards the global training objective receive more rewards.
However, without actually training the model, it is generally impossible to determine how clients’ participation level and their non-i.i.d. data affect the model performance. This leads to our second key question: </p>

</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">From the clients’ perspective, instead of purely providing training data and services to gain profit,

FL, e.g., to obtain a more powerful global model for their own use when they have few or skewed local data samples. Depending on a client’s intrinsic value, the server may adopt a flexible pricing mechanism and achieve the proper trade-off between encouraging clients’ participation and reducing the overall cost. <em id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">To our best knowledge, the role of intrinsic value has not been studied in the FL incentive mechanism</em>.</p>

<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the above discussion, this paper proposes a novel incentive mechanism for FL with <em id="S1.p10.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">randomized partial client participation</em>, where the server motivates clients to join FL with different participation levels (probabilities) as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Incentive Mechanism Design for Unbiased Federated Learning with Randomized Client Participation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Specifically, we model the interaction between the server and clients as a sequential two-stage <em id="S1.p10.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Stackelberg game</em>, where the server (leader) decides a <em id="S1.p10.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">customized pricing</em> scheme for each client’s participation level to maximize the global model performance. Each client (follower) then responds to the server’s monetary incentive by independently
choosing its best participating level to maximize its own profit, based on the incurred local cost as well as the intrinsic value for the global model.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">We first develop an adaptive model aggregation scheme
to guarantee the model unbiasedness for arbitrary independent client participation levels. With the unbiased design, we obtain a new FL convergence bound, which analytically establishes the relationship between the global model performance and clients’ arbitrary participation levels with unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data without actually training the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Then, based on the convergence bound, we obtain the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) via solving a non-convex optimization
problem, which reveals interesting design principles. Counter-intuitively, we show that in order to achieve an unbiased global model, the server will set higher prices for clients who have larger local costs. For the clients,
those with higher intrinsic values may receive lower prices (compensations) from the server and choose lower participation
levels. When the clients’ intrinsic values are higher than a certain threshold, the clients may need to pay for the server for participation, which leads to a <em id="S1.p12.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">bi-directional payment</em>.</p>

In the literature, existing works mainly focus on designing incentives mechanism with full client participation (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the server’s limited budget and clients’ heterogeneous local resources,
recent FL incentive mechanisms (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>) have considered more practical partial client participation scenarios.
However, these works
mainly stimulate a <em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">deterministic</em> subset of “valuable” clients and train the global model only with these clients’ data.
Although such mechanisms may speed up the training process at a certain level and have merits in eliciting clients’ private information, they
may result in a biased global model if the selected clients have skewed data. We propose to incentivize all clients to join FL with independent participation probabilities, which enables the server to obtain all clients’ data contributions to guarantee the model’s unbiasedness. </p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, most existing incentive mechanisms evaluate clients’ contribution based on their data quantity (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>) or computation/communication resources (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>), which do not capture the critical heterogeneous data distribution across clients. Our mechanism measures clients’ contribution via a theoretical convergence result for general statistical heterogeneity with unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data.</p>

Specifically, before the model has been fully trained, it is generally impossible to know exactly how different FL configurations (e.g., clients’ different participation levels in this paper) affect the FL performance. Therefore, to optimize the FL performance, we need to have a lightweight surrogate that can (approximately) predict what will happen if we choose a specific configuration. A common surrogate used for this purpose is the convergence upper bound, which has become a common practice in the communications and networking community (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>). Moreover, our experiments in Section VI demonstrate the superiority of our designed
pricing scheme based on the convergence bound, in terms
of achieving higher global model performance and higher client
profits compared to baseline schemes.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed a randomized client participation mechanism for FL, which guarantees that the obtained model is unbiased and converges to the globally optimal model.
We derived a new tractable
convergence bound that analytically characterizes the impact of clients’ participation levels and their non-i.i.d data on the server’s model performance, which yields a more accurate and customized pricing scheme. To characterize clients’ internal interests in the global model, we introduced and modeled a new <em id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">intrinsic value</em> in clients’ utilities, which allows clients to pay for the server. We showed both theoretical and empirical evidence that the intrinsic value plays a critical role in the server and clients’ decision-making. We conducted extensive experiments on a developed hardware prototype to demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism.

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our mechanism serves as an initial step towards the incentive mechanism design to achieve an unbiased and convergence guaranteed model with practical randomized client participation.
In the future, we will extend our incentive mechanism for <em id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">incomplete information</em> scenarios using <em id="S7.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Bayesian</em> method. We will further refine our cost model by decoupling the local cost into computation and communication consumption, and design an effective measurement to model clients’ intrinsic value. </p>
