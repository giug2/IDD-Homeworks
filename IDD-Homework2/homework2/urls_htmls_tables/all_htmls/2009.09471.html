<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">A synthetic dataset is a data object that is generated programmatically, and it may be valuable to creating a single dataset from multiple sources when direct collection is difficult or costly. Although it is a fundamental step for many data science tasks, an efficient and standard framework is absent. In this paper, we study a specific synthetic data generation task called <span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">downscaling</span>, a procedure to infer high-resolution, harder-to-collect information (e.g., individual level records) from many low-resolution, easy-to-collect sources, and propose a multi-stage framework called <span id="id6.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">SynC</span> (<span id="id6.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Syn</span>thetic Data Generation via Gaussian <span id="id6.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>opula). For given low-resolution datasets, the central idea of <span id="id6.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">SynC</span> is to fit Gaussian copula models to each of the low-resolution datasets in order to correctly capture dependencies and marginal distributions, and then sample from the fitted models to obtain the desired high-resolution subsets. Predictive models are then used to merge sampled subsets into one, and finally, sampled datasets are scaled according to low-resolution marginal constraints. We make four key contributions in this work: 1) propose a novel framework for generating individual level data from aggregated data sources by combining state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical techniques, 2) perform simulation studies to validate <span id="id6.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">SynC</span>’s performance as a synthetic data generation algorithm, 3) demonstrate its value as a feature engineering tool, as well as an alternative to data collection in situations where gathering is difficult through two real-world datasets, 4) release an easy-to-use framework implementation for reproducibility and scalability at the production level that easily incorporates new data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data is a data object that is artificially created rather than collected from actual events. It is widely used in applications like harmonizing multiple data sources or augmenting existing data. In many practical settings, sensitive information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers are considered personally-identifiable, and hence are not releasable. However, these fields are natural keys to combine multiple data sources collect by different organizations at different times. To overcome this, synthetic data generation becomes a very attractive alternative to obtaining data for practitioners. To efficiently produce high quality data, we study a procedure called downscaling, which attempts to generate high-resolution data (e.g., individual level records) from multiple low-resolution sources (e.g., averages of many individual records). Because low-resolution data is no longer personally-identifiable, it can be published without concerns of releasing personal information. However, practitioners often find individual level data far more appealing, as aggregated data lack information such as variances and distributions of variables. For the downscaled synthetic data to be useful, it needs to be <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fair</span> and <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">consistent</span>. The first condition means that simulated data should mimic realistic distributions and correlations of the true population as closely as possible. The second condition implies that when we aggregate downscaled samples, the results need to be consistent with the original data. A more rigorous analysis is provided in the later section.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data generation is often seen as a privacy-preserving way to combine multiple data sources in cases where direct collection is difficult or when common keys among multiple sources are missing. In applications where large-scale data collection involves manual surveys (e.g., demographics), or when the collected data is highly sensitive and cannot be fully released to the public (e.g., financial or health data), synthetically generated datasets become an ideal substitute. For example, due to privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, organizations across the world are forbidden to release personally identifiable data. As a result, such datasets are often anonymized and aggregated (such as geographical aggregation, where variables are summed or averaged across a certain region). Being able to join the lower-resolution sources, therefore, is a key step to reconstruct the full information from partial sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Common techniques for synthetic data generation are synthetic reconstruction (SR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and combinatorial optimization (CO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Existing approaches have specific data requirements and limitations which usually cannot be easily resolved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we propose a new framework called <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">SynC</span> (<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Syn</span>thetic Data Generation via Gaussian <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>opula) to simulate microdata by sampling features in batches. The concept is motivated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which are purely based on copula and distribution fitting. The rationale behind our framework is that features can be segmented into distinct batches based on their correlations, which reduces the high dimensional problem into several sub-problems in lower dimensions. Feature dependency in high dimensions is hard to evaluate via common methods due to its complexity and computation requirements, and as such, Gaussian copula, a family of multivariate distributions that is capable of capturing dependencies among random variables, becomes an ideal candidate for the application.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic reconstruction (SR) is the most commonly used technique to generate synthetic data. This approach reconstructs the desired distribution from survey data while constrained by the marginal distributions. Simulated individuals are sampled from a joint distribution which is estimated by an iterative process to form a synthetic population. Typical iterative procedures used to estimate the joint distribution are iterative proportional fitting (IPF) and matrix ranking. The IPF algorithm fits a n-dimensional contingency table base on sampled data and fixed marginal distributions. The inner cells are then scaled to match the given marginal distribution. The process is repeated until the entries converge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">IPF has many advantages like maximizing entropy, minimizing discrimination information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and resulting in maximum likelihood estimator of the true contingency table <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, IPF is only applicable to categorical variables. The <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">SynC</span> framework incorporates predictive models to approximate each feature, which can be used to produce real-valued outputs as well and probability distribution that can be sampled from to produce discrete features.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given a subset of individual data with features of interest, the motivation behind combinatorial optimization (CO) is to find the best combination of individuals that satisfy the marginal distributions while optimizing a fitness function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. CO is typically initialized with a random subset of individuals, and individuals are swapped with a pool of candidates iteratively to increase the fitness of the group. Compared to SR based approaches, CO can reach more accurate approximations, but often at the expense of exponential growth of computational power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Copula is a statistical model used to understand the dependency structures among different distributions (details are discussed in Section <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Proposed Framework</span>), and has been widely used in synthetic data generation tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, downscaling is not possible, and the sampled data stay at the same level of granularity as the input. Jeong et al. discuss an enhanced version of IPF where the fitting process is done via copula functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Similar to IPF, this algorithm relies on the integrity of the input data, which, as discussed before, can be problematic in real-world settings. Our method, <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">SynC</span>, is less restrictive on the initial condition of the input dataset as it only requires aggregated level data. Therefore <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">SynC</span> is more accessible compared to previous approaches.</p>

Microsimulation tasks are sensitive to outliers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and conducting outlier detection before any analysis is therefore important. Outlier removal methods are often selected by the underlying assumptions and the actual condition of the data. Notably, the necessity of this process depends on the practitioners’ definition of abnormality, although it is recommended in most cases.

Additionally, Sklar’s Theorem states that for any set of random variables with continuous CDFs, there exists a unique copula as described above. It allows us to isolate the modeling of marginal distributions from their underlying dependencies. Sampling from copulae is widely used by empiricists to produced deserved multivariate samples based on a given correlation matrix and the desired marginal distributions of each of the components.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Because of the popularity of the normal distribution and the other advantages mentioned above, Gaussian copula has been one of the most widely adopted dependence models. The earliest application of Gaussian Copula was in the finance industry: Frees and Valdez applied the technique to insurance pricing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, while Hull and White used it in credit derivative pricing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. More recently, the application of Gaussian copula models have been found in many fields such as linkage analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, functional disability data modeling<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and power demand stochastic modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

For the next two experiments, our data comes from the 2016 Canadian National Census, which is collected by Statistics Canada and compiled once every five years. The census is aggregated at the postal code level and made available to the general public. There are 793,815 residential postal codes in Canada (in the format L#L#L#, where L is a letter and # is a digit), with an average of 47 residents per postal code. The dataset contains more than 4,000 variables ranging from demographics, spending habits, financial assets, and social values.

This type of analysis is extremely important in marketing, as contacting customers can be both expensive (e.g., hiring sales agents to make calls) and dangerous (e.g., potentially leading to unhappy customers and therefore unsubscribing emails or services).

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A challenge of <span id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">SynC</span> as a feature engineering tool is the fact that synthetic population is anonymous. In most applications, enterprise level data sources are individually identifiable through an identifier which may be unique to the company (e.g. customer ID for multiple products/divisions at one company) or multiple companies (e.g. cookie IDs which can be shared between multiple apps/websites). This makes merging different data sources very easy as the identifier can be used as the primary key. By construct, however, synthetic population individuals are model generated from anonymous data, and therefore cannot be joined by traditional means. Here we present an alternative method called <span id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Probabilistic Matching</span>.</p>

In table 3 we show the first few customers supplied by our industry partner. We also provide the list of synthetically generated persons for postal code V3N1P5 in Appendix Table <a href="#Sx1.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ APPENDIX ‣ SynC: A Copula based Framework for Generating Synthetic Data from Aggregated Sources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>, and use this as an example to demonstrate how probabilistic matching can be done on the first customer.</p>

First of all, our method relies on Gaussian copulae and this can be further extended by leveraging other families of copula models to better model the underlying dependency structures. Secondly, we use beta and log-normal distributions to approximate marginal distributions for categorical and continuous variables, respectively, and other families of distributions could be considered (e.g., the <math id="S5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\kappa" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">κ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝜅</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1c">\kappa</annotation></semantics></math>-generalized model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> can be used for money related distributions).
