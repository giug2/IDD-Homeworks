<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated learning (FL) is a key enabler for efficient communication and computing, leveraging devices’ distributed computing capabilities.
However, applying FL in practice is challenging due to the local devices’ heterogeneous energy, wireless channel conditions, and non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data distributions.
To cope with these issues, this paper proposes a novel learning framework by integrating FL and width-adjustable slimmable neural networks (SNN).
Integrating FL with SNNs is challenging due to time-varying channel conditions and data distributions.
In addition, existing multi-width SNN training algorithms are sensitive to the data distributions across devices, which makes SNN ill-suited for FL. Motivated by this, we propose a communication and energy-efficient SNN-based FL (named <span id="id2.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SlimFL</span>) that jointly utilizes <span id="id2.id1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">superposition coding (SC)</span> for global model aggregation and <span id="id2.id1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">superposition training (ST)</span> for updating local models. By applying SC, SlimFL exchanges the superposition of multiple-width configurations decoded as many times as possible for a given communication throughput. Leveraging ST, SlimFL aligns the forward propagation of different width configurations while avoiding inter-width interference during backpropagation. We formally prove the convergence of SlimFL. The result reveals that SlimFL is not only communication-efficient but also deals with non-IID data distributions and poor channel conditions, which is also corroborated by data-intensive simulations.</span></p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advances in machine learning (ML), and hardware technologies have pushed deep learning down from cloud servers to edge devices such as phones, cars, and the Internet of things (IoT) devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. These edge devices collectively constitute a source of ever-growing big data, so are indispensable for training high-quality machine learning models. Meanwhile, each edge device stores only a tiny fraction of the big data, which is often privacy-sensitive (e.g., navigation history, e-Health wearable records, and surveillance camera photos). To exploit these opportunities and address the challenges induced by edge devices, federated learning (FL) is a promising solution that allows edge devices to train a global model by exchanging locally trained models instead of raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At its core, FL operations rest on repeatedly constructing a global model averaged over the local models, which is downloaded by each device to replace its local model with the new global model. By design, FL necessitates the use of a single global model for all devices. This requirement restricts the scalability and accuracy of FL, particularly when scaling to the sheer number of edge devices, which have non-identical memory resources and energy budgets not to be mentioned as different communication channel conditions. Therefore, the use of a single large model may be suited for only a few devices, whereas the use of a tiny model should be accompanied by compromising accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the aforementioned issues in communication-energy efficiencies and scalability, the recently proposed slimmable neural network (SNN) architectures have great potential in that an SNN can adjust its model width in accordance with its available energy budget or task difficulty. Inspired from this, in this article, we propose an <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SNN-based FL algorithm</span> that makes use of <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">superposition coding (SC)</span> and <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">successive decoding (SD)</span>, coined <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">slimmable FL (SlimFL)</span>.
To illustrate the effectiveness of SlimFL, consider an SNN with two width configurations, as seen in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I-C Organization ‣ I Introduction ‣ SlimFL: Federated Learning with Superposition Coding over Slimmable Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Each device uploads its local updates during the uplink to the server after jointly encoding the left-half (LH) and right-half (RH) of its local SNN model and assigning distinct transmission power levels, i.e., SC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The server then makes an attempt to decode the LH. If the LH is successfully decoded, the server attempts to decode the RH consecutively, i.e., SD, also known as successive interference cancellation (SIC). As a result, when the device-server channel throughput is poor, the server decodes only the LH of the uploaded model, yielding a model with a <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">half-width (0.5x) width</span>. When the channel has a high throughput, the server may decode both LH and RH and combine them to produce the <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">full-width model (1.0x)</span>. As a result, the server creates a global model superimposing the decoded 0.5x and 1.0x local models, which each device downloads. The device substitutes the downloaded global model for its local model and repeats the preceding step until convergence. In addition, the same technique may be extended to the server-to-device downlink.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">SlimFL’s efficacy is contingent upon achieving synergy between several width configurations, namely 0.5x and 1.0x models, which is a difficult task. The existing FL algorithm does not focus on synergetic of 0.5x and 1.0x. In addition, since the local model has various width configurations, training them may conflict with one another.
To the best of our knowledge, FL with different width configurations have not been proposed, yet. Existing SNN architectures and training techniques are designed for standalone learning and so are unsuitable for SlimFL, especially when data distributions are not independent and identical (non-IID). To address these issues in SlimFL, we provide a new SNN architecture and training method called <span id="S1.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">superposition training (ST)</span>, as well as a study of SlimFL’s convergence and efficiency.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, each edge device trains its model with its own data. After training, all parameters of each local model are transmitted to the server (e.g., cloud, fog, or edge). The server reconstructs the global model by aggregating the local model parameters. FL is privacy-preserving because the device does not transmit its own data to the server. FL has advantages regarding communication/computing costs as well as privacy-preserving.
For example, <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Averaging</span> (FedAvg) reduces 10-100x of communication costs compared to the existing distributed machine learning algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In addition, FL with local batch normalization (FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>), FL with a generalization and re-parametrization (FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>), or adaptative aggregation (FedOpt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>) improves the speed of convergence of the FL regime, which means reducing more communication/computing costs through training algorithms.
However, the reduced communication/computing cost is non-negligible, because the communication cost is proportional to the model size. To cope with this problem, one approach is to optimize resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The other approach is split learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which reduces communication costs by transmitting smashed data rather than model parameters.
The other option is to investigate deep learning technique, <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</span> model pruning to satisfy varying on-device energy and memory limits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> or to distill the knowledge of a big trained model into a small empty model through knowledge distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, but this requires extra training operations. Alternatively, one may alter the width and/or depth of a trained model to match the resource needs. After training, depth-controlled neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and adaptive neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> can modify their depths, while SNNs alter their widths <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
According to studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, many SNN architectures and their algorithms are proposed. In this paper, we leverage width-controllable SNNs, and develop its FL version, SlimFL. Such an extension is non-trivial and entails several design issues, such as local SNN training algorithms, aggregating segment prioritization.</p>

Precisely, SlimFL prioritizes an SNN’s LH to obtain the 0.5x model across inferior channels. SlimFL is capable of decoding the RH of the SNN only under favorable the channel circumstances, yielding the 1.0x model by merging both LH and RH. As a result, SlimFL provides consistent convergence even in the presence of weak channels.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Lightweight deep learning techniques have been studied widely.
Thus many complicated models are distributed to mobile devices via quantization, e.g., TensorRT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, training models in mobile devices still requires computational cost as same as the existing methods.
We utilize SNNs as both devices and server models. The key idea of SNN is to reduce floating point operations per second (FLOPS) by activating the selected weights. We compare the existing NN operation to SNN’s.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Training a multi-width SNN is arduous. The SNN backpropagation (BP) is warped due to gradient interference of multi-width. For example, the BP of 0.5x width configurations interferences the BP of 1.0x’s and vice versa.
This inter-width interference hinders not just inference accuracy but also training convergence. SlimTrain (see <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In III-B Superposition SNN Training ‣ III SNN Model Architecture and Training ‣ SlimFL: Federated Learning with Superposition Coding over Slimmable Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a></span>), the first SNN training algorithm introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, partially ameliorates such inter-width interference by training alternative width configurations in descending order of size.
While adhering to the sample principle, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have proposed a state-of-the-art SNN training technique called universal SNN (USTrain).</p>

By nature, it gives more benefits under a larger SNN (i.e., a better teacher) that has more sub-width configurations (i.e., more students).
The IPKD encourages each sub-width (i.e., student) to provide a softmax output (i.e., logit) to that of the full-width (i.e., teacher), so that their overlapping BP gradients become less dissimilar, hence minimizing the inter-width interference. At its core, the inplace distillation and the sandwich rule are effective under the case where an SNN can be divided into more than two segments. The SNN architecture considered in this paper consists of only the LH and RH segments, making the USTrain unfit for our case. Moreover, during updating the local parameters of slimmable model, some of the parameters composing small model needs partial gradient calculation of big model.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While effective in standalone learning, in SlimFL with wireless connectivity, not all multi-width configurations are exchanged due to insufficient communication throughput. In other words, they exchanged width configurations are aggregated across devices, diluting the effectiveness of BN.
In our experiments, we even observed training convergence failures due to BN. Furthermore, managing multiple BN layers not only consumes additional memory costs but also entails a high computing overhead.</p>

SUSTrain consists of two processes. First, all the forward propagation losses (FP) are holden. Then, all the width configurations are concurrently updated with the superpositioned gradients. With SUSTrain, a sub-width configuration (i.e., student) is trained using IPKD without the logit mismatch with its full-width configuration’s logit (i.e., teacher’s logit), while the full-width configuration is simultaneously trained using the ground truth.</p>

For simplicity without loss of generality, we consider that the bandwidth is orthogonally and equally allocated to each device, thereby ignoring inter-user interference. Notwithstanding, we still consider the interference due to SC and SD operations. For mathematical amenability, we assume that the interference is treated as noise, and use the Shannon’s capacity formula with the Gaussian codebook, i.e., the use of optimal source and channel coding, which are widely used assumptions for analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>

SlimFL enjoys the benefits mentioned above while consuming only half of the transmission power and bandwidth compared to Vanilla FL-1.5x, as presented in Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="Table V ‣ VI-B Efficiency, Robustness, and Scalability of SlimFL ‣ VI Experiments ‣ SlimFL: Federated Learning with Superposition Coding over Slimmable Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, corroborating its communication efficiency. Because a part of the transmission power of SlimFL is allocated to 0.5x models, SlimFL decodes less than 1.0x model bits than Vanilla FL-1.0x. In return, SlimFL receives not only 1.0x models but also 0.5x models simultaneously. The additional received 0.5x models coincide with the LH parts of the 1.0x models, which improve the accuracy and convergence speed of both 0.5x and 1.0x models.</p>

We conjecture that the problem comes from the use of outdated teacher’s knowledge in USTrain.
In USTrain, the teacher’s logit is set as the value before updating the teacher’s model and is compared with a student after updating the teacher’s model. Non-IID data distributions exacerbate this mismatch, where the full-width teacher model is significantly updated in the first epoch after downloading the global model due to the huge gap between local and global models.</p>

In phase II, the IPS requirement is satisfied when using SNN-1/6x and SNN-2/6x. However, it is recommended to use SNN-2/6x, because the top-1 accuracy increases 4.7%. Similarly, SNN-3/6x, SNN-4/6x are recommended to be used in phase III, and phase IV, and V, respectively.
Furthermore, we can use six model configurations with the memory usage of SNN-1.0x. If vanilla NN is used, 3.5x more memory is required than using SNN. Thus, using SNN is an adjustable solution for computational energy heterogeneous conditions.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing FL solutions are incapable of adjusting flexibly to devices with varying amounts of available energy and channel throughput without jeopardizing communication or energy efficiency.
To overcome this problem, we propose SlimFL, a novel framework for FL over SNNs that utilizes superpositioned training for local SNN training and superposition coding for trained model aggregation. Extensive analyses and simulations show that SlimFL is an energy- and communication-efficient solution in a variety of communication conditions and data distributions. SlimFL achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence while using less energy than vanilla FL, which requires 2X more communication resources. Additionally, studying the impact of more adjustable SNN width levels could be an interesting topic for future work. Another interesting direction is to apply SlimFL for multitask learning with various width configurations in different tasks.</p>
