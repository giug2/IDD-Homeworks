<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Efficient collaboration between collaborative machine learning and wireless communication technology, forming a Federated Edge Learning (FEEL), has spawned a series of next-generation intelligent applications. However, due to the openness of network connections, the FEEL framework generally involves hundreds of remote devices (or clients), resulting in expensive communication costs, which is not friendly to resource-constrained FEEL. To address this issue, we propose a distributed approximate Newton-type algorithm with fast convergence speed to alleviate the problem of FEEL resource (in terms of communication resources) constraints. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is improved based on distributed L-BFGS algorithm and allows each client to approximate the high-cost Hessian matrix by computing the low-cost Fisher matrix in a distributed manner to find a “better” descent direction, thereby speeding up convergence. Second, we prove that the proposed algorithm has linear convergence in strongly convex and non-convex cases and analyze its computational and communication complexity. Similarly, due to the heterogeneity of the connected remote devices, FEEL faces the challenge of heterogeneous data and non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To this end, we design a simple but elegant training scheme, namely FedOVA, to solve the heterogeneous statistical challenge brought by heterogeneous data. In this way, FedOVA first decomposes a multi-class classification problem into more straightforward binary classification problems and then combines their respective outputs using ensemble learning. In particular, the scheme can be well integrated with our communication efficient algorithm to serve FEEL. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the convergence of machine learning technology and wireless communication technology, various smart mobile applications have been developed to provide people with high-quality services, which have revolutionized our daily lives and brought benefits to the human societies and national economy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
The key idea of developing machine learning-based smart mobile applications in wireless networks is to learn (train) models leveraging the rich data collected by massively distributed user devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
For example, traditional cloud computing-based centralized machine learning frameworks focus on central data processing, which generally requires widely distributed mobile devices to offload their local training data to remote cloud centers for centralized learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, such a solution still faces two severe challenges: limited communication resources and data privacy. It is impractical for edge devices with limited resources (in terms of computation and communication resources) to offload massive amounts of local training data to the remote cloud center.
On the other hand, since the remote cloud center is inevitably attacked by some malicious opponents, the private information involved in the training data uploaded by the edge device may be leaked <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, such a framework is no longer suitable for a modern society that values the right to privacy, motivating us to develop a new learning framework to solve the above challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the two challenging issues, the researchers designed a novel architecture called Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which significantly reduces communication latency and mobile energy consumption by migrating cloud computation capability and learning tasks from remote cloud center to edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, previous work cannot be used to mitigate our challenging issues. The main reason is that the server in the MEC architecture still needs to access the original data of the remote device, which still leads to privacy leaks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
To address the privacy concern, a collaborative model training scheme was proposed, i.e., Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which leverages large amounts of data distributed over multiple edge devices, such that the latter do not share locally private data with any centralized entity.
Concretely, edge devices (or <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clients</em>) are asked to upload model updates to a centralized server iteratively, thereby jointly training a shared global model.
In this context, the central server can use the rich distributed data to train the optimal shared model and can rationally allocate the computation resources of the edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Inspired by the above facts, effective collaboration between MEC and FL (as known as Federated Edge Learning (FEEL)) has great potential to promote the use of collaborative machine learning in next-generation smart applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although the FEEL framework has achieved great success in edge computing networks and spawned a series of emerging applications such as Google Keyboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, it still suffers from heterogeneous data and resource constraints (in terms of communication cost) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Unlike the MEC architecture, the data at the edge is generally heterogeneous and non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) in the FEEL framework, which impairs the performance of the machine learning model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Obviously, due to data heterogeneous challenges and non-IID data issues, resulting in slower convergence speed (i.e., more training rounds), expensive communication overhead is still the bottleneck of FEEL. Therefore, it is necessary to build a bridge to link training schemes that relieve heterogeneous data with efficient communication algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Building such a bridge inevitably needs to answer the following question: <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">how to develop a distributed training algorithm which uses a minimal number of communication rounds to achieve model performance comparable to that of the benchmark FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> for convergence and handles non-IID and heterogeneous data across edge devices?</em>
To answer the above question, our goal is to develop a distributed optimization algorithm to achieve faster convergence while being robust to non-IID data. Towards the goal, we present an (approximate) Newton-type method-based distributed second-order optimization algorithm. Our starting point is leveraging gradient and curvature information to find a “better” descent direction, thereby significantly speeding up the convergence speed. Standing on top of it, to address non-IID issues, we propose a simple but elegant training scheme, namely FedOVA, which can work effectively with the non-IID data in FEEL by decomposing the multi-classification task into multiple binary classification tasks. Specifically, our insight is to decompose a federated multiclass classification task on non-IID data into multiple binary classification tasks on the client-side by introducing the One-vs-All <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> training scheme.

The classic L-BFGS with stochastic batches is generally unstable, which is not friendly for us to implement this algorithm in a distributed manner.
For this reason, we use smooth estimation to evaluate the gradient difference while utilizing the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to approximate the Hessian matrix to accelerate the convergence.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Edge Learning (FEEL) is an emerging mobile edge computing framework that integrates the advantages of federated learning (artificial intelligence) and mobile edge computing, which arouses the research interest of researchers.
The survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> comprehensively introduced FEEL’s architecture, the state-of-the-art techniques, standards, and case studies and gave some future research directions.
Although there are many unfilled research gaps in the FEEL field, the academic and industrial circles generally focus on topics such as resource optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, communication efficiency optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, statistical heterogeneous optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and security and privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
In terms of resource optimization, researchers generally utilized economic tools (e.g., contract theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, auction theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>), and designed some incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> to implement resource management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and resource scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> in FEEL.
For communication efficiency optimization, they utilized compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> techniques to reduce the communications volume, thereby improving the communication efficiency of the FEEL framework.
Furthermore, the FEEL framework’s security and privacy research topics have never left the researchers’ sight. As for the present, some common malicious attacks against the FEEL framework such as poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, adversarial attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, and gradient leakage attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> have been extensively studied.
In the future, more new problems and new challenges will be raised and solved by researchers.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The first-order distributed optimization method is the most common and practical in a distributed learning environment, in which it mainly leverages gradient information to find a descent direction to update the global model iteratively.
Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (D-SGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> as a classic example of this type of algorithm has derived a series of variants such as ColumnSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, variance-reduced SGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and so on.
However, these algorithms sacrifice communication rounds in exchange for accuracy, which is unfriendly to the resource-constrained FEEL framework.

<div id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike the classic first-order distributed optimization method, the second-order distributed optimization method utilizes gradient information and second-order information (i.e., curvature information) to find a “better” descent direction to update the global model iteratively. 
However, previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> pointed out that the complex inverse matrix-vector product involved in the calculation of curvature information is not suitable for distributed environments.
To this end, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, the authors designed DANE, DONE, and GIANT, respectively, to overcome this problem.
Specifically, DANE circumvented the challenges mentioned above by designing a well-designed local optimization problem, while DONE proposed a distributed approximate Newton method based on the Richardson iteration.
GIANT used the harmonic mean Hessian matrix to approximate the true Hessian matrix, significantly reducing communication costs.
Similar to GIANT, we focus on how to approximate the Hessian matrix to reduce communication costs efficiently. This paper develops a variant of the L-BFGS algorithm that uses the Fisher information matrix to approximate the Hessian matrix to achieve fast convergence.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Statistical challenges (i.e., heterogeneous data and non-IID data) are unresolved issues in the FEEL framework.
The gradient-based aggregation rules (e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>) rely on D-SGD, which is widely used to iteratively train deep learning models under the assumption of IID training data.
The purpose of learning from IID training data is to ensure that the stochastic gradient is an unbiased estimate of the full gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In practice, however, it is unrealistic to assume that the local data on each edge client are always IID.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works have addressed the non-IID issue in FEEL by designing additional framework mechanisms. For example, Zhao <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> introduced a data-sharing mechanism to improve FedAvg in non-IID data settings.
The proposed mechanism involves distributing a small amount of globally shared data containing examples of each class, thereby introducing a trade-off between accuracy and centralization.
However, this approach unintentionally discloses the client’s private data as the dataset is publicly shared, hence violating FL’s privacy protection requirement.
Another popular solution is to design a performance-oriented client selection mechanism. Kopparapu <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> proposed FedCD, an aggregation method that can clone and delete models to dynamically group devices with similar data, thereby selecting the clients with high-quality updates to mitigate the non-IID issue.
However, the server needs to calculate the model quality score in each round to decide whether to clone or delete it, introducing additional computational overhead.
Nonetheless, in real-world applications, applying reinforcement learning within resource-constrained FL environments is likely to be impractical. However, how to organically combine communication efficient algorithms with non-IID robust algorithms is still an open question.</p>

In this paper, to address this challenge, we design an FIM-based distributed L-BFGS method for the resource-constrained FEEL framework to approximate Hessian at a low cost and achieve fast convergence.</p>

It is important to note that, although OVA is a general-purpose approach to multi-class classification that has been used for decades, existing OVA-based works have focused on centralized learning. In this work, we instead leverage distributed OVA to tackle the open problem of distributed multi-class classification under non-IID data.
Specifically, we take advantage of the independence of each binary classifier in OVA and incorporate it into FEEL to propose a novel training scheme named FedOVA. This scheme is able to solve the non-IID data problem in FEEL efficiently, as will be described in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Our Algorithm Design ‣ Resource-constrained Federated Edge Learning with Heterogeneous Data: Formulation and Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates FEEL and OVA to address FEEL with non-IID data. Moreover, this solution will not affect the normal execution of the communication efficient algorithm, which opens a door for solving the non-IID problem and the expensive communication overhead problem at the same time.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.5" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present a detailed training procedure on how to combine OVA and FEEL, i.e., FedOVA (see Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="In IV-A FIM-based Approximate Distributed Optimization Algorithm ‣ IV Our Algorithm Design ‣ Resource-constrained Federated Edge Learning with Heterogeneous Data: Formulation and Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). We then explain why the proposed FedOVA can address the statistical challenges of federated optimization with non-IID data in a multi-classification task. Recall that the non-IID problem in FEEL means that clients cannot obtain enough labels of multiple classes through data sharing and thus cannot train a high-precision multiclass classification model, thereby limiting the scalability of the FEEL framework.
We assume that there is a server responsible for the coordination of a client set <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{K}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒦</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝒦</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{K}</annotation></semantics></math> in FEEL, where each client has a local dataset <math id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{D}_{k},k\in\left\{1,~{}2,~{}\dots,~{}K\right\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.2.cmml"><msub id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒟</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.2.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.5.5" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.5.5.cmml">k</mi></mrow><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.2.cmml">∈</mo><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.1.cmml"><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.1.cmml">{</mo><mn id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">1</mn><mo rspace="0.497em" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml">2</mn><mo rspace="0.497em" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.3.3.cmml">…</mi><mo rspace="0.497em" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.2.4" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.4.4" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.4.4.cmml">K</mi><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.2.5" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6"><in id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.2"></in><list id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.2">𝒟</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.5.5.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.5.5">𝑘</ci></list><set id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6.6.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2">2</cn><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.3.3">…</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.4.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.4.4">𝐾</ci></set></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.6c">\mathcal{D}_{k},k\in\left\{1,~{}2,~{}\dots,~{}K\right\}</annotation></semantics></math> and the total number of classes is <math id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, we compare the convergence speed of the proposed second-order optimization algorithm with the commonly used FedDANE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> (Federated Newton-Type Method, second-order), FedAvg-based SGD (first-order), and FedAvg-based Adam (first-order) optimization algorithms. First, we conduct experiments on the F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and KWS datasets under the IID setting to observe the convergence speed of different optimization algorithms. As shown in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VI-A Experimental Setup ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Resource-constrained Federated Edge Learning with Heterogeneous Data: Formulation and Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, the proposed algorithm converges faster than the baseline methods on the F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and KWS datasets under the IID setting. For example, For example, for the KWS dataset, our algorithm converges <math id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="2\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><mn id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">2</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">2\times</annotation></semantics></math> as fast as the popular Federal Newton method and <math id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="2.5\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><mn id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">2.5</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">2.5\times</annotation></semantics></math> faster than the conventional first-order optimization algorithm. The reason is that the gradient information and curvature information are used in the proposed algorithm to find a “better” descent direction to speed up the convergence speed.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VI-A Experimental Setup ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Resource-constrained Federated Edge Learning with Heterogeneous Data: Formulation and Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, it can be seen from the experimental results that although the proposed algorithm converges faster than the baseline methods, its performance is slightly lower than that of the baseline methods. This implies that convergence speed and accuracy are a trade-off in the distributed second-order optimization algorithm. In practice, SGD and Adam can use first-order information (i.e., gradient information) to find a better convergence point so that the performance is better than the second-order methods. It is worth noting that such a slight loss of precision in exchange for high communication efficiency is friendly to the resource-constrained FEEL framework. Therefore, in future research, we will focus more on improving the performance of the second-order optimization method.</p>

Our simulation results are presented in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VI-C Performance Comparison with Different Robust Training Schemes ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Resource-constrained Federated Edge Learning with Heterogeneous Data: Formulation and Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. Using either the FedOVA or the FedAvg algorithm, classification accuracy improved as the number of classes in the client’s local dataset increased.
However, there are still two points worthy of attention: the first is that different non-IID configurations had a dramatic impact on the performance of FedAvg but did not have a significant influence on FedOVA.
The second is that the FedOVA achieved superior performance compared to FedAvg in every non-IID scenario. These two observations fully illustrate the robustness of our proposed method for non-IID environments.</p>

The experimental results are summarized in Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ VI-D Effect of Large Scale Clients and Small Scale Samples ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Resource-constrained Federated Edge Learning with Heterogeneous Data: Formulation and Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. It appears that the use of FedAvg led to a substantial decrease in accuracy as the number of clients increased; crucially, this was the case with FedOVA.
Our method adopts the idea of OVA to train several binary classifiers, and the increase in the number of clients also improves the robustness of the binary classifier to different environments. In this way, it is still possible to achieve competitive results with fewer data.</p>

However, as the batch size in each epoch increased, the convergence of the algorithm slowed down.
This result indicates that performing more gradient descent updates during each training round helps accelerate model convergence, enabling the model to reach a satisfactory performance in a short period of time.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed a promising solution to simultaneously alleviate expensive communication costs and heterogeneous data problems for resource-constrained FEEL. Our insight is to design a robust training scheme for heterogeneous data and does not conflict with efficient communication algorithms. To improve the communication efficiency of resource-constrained FEEL, we have customized an FIM-based distributed approximate second-order optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we proved that the algorithm has linear convergence in the case of strong convexity and non-convexity, and analyzed its computational and communication complexity. Besides, to design an algorithm coupled with the above-mentioned communication efficient algorithm and robust to heterogeneous data, we first proposed a federated training scheme named FedOVA with the help of the traditional OVA method. With extensive experiments, we effectively validate the expected properties of our algorithm and empirically demonstrate its capability of reducing the communication cost and being robust to heterogeneous data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we will further analyze the characteristics of each component classifier in FedOVA in an attempt to find an optimal training approach towards improving the performance of each model. Furthermore, we will investigate how to combine this scheme with asynchronous training to obtain better adaptation to real scenarios.</p>
