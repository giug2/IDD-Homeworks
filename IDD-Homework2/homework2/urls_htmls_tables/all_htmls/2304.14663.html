These methods require vast amounts of training data which are available in the medical sector, albeit decentralized. Medical institutions generate vast amounts of data for which sharing and centralizing remains a challenge as the result of data and privacy regulations. The federated learning technique is well-suited to tackle these challenges. However, federated learning comes with a new set of open problems related to communication overhead, efficient parameter aggregation, client selection strategies and more.</p>
<p id="id3.id2" class="ltx_p"><span id="id3.id2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Methods:</span> In this work, we address the step prior to the initiation of a federated network for model training, client recruitment. By intelligently recruiting clients, communication overhead and overall cost of training can be reduced without sacrificing predictive performance. Client recruitment aims at pre-excluding potential clients from partaking in the federation based on a set of criteria indicative of their eventual contributions to the federation. In this work, we propose a client recruitment approach using only the output distribution and sample size at the client site.</p>
<p id="id4.id3" class="ltx_p"><span id="id4.id3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Results:</span> We show how a subset of clients can be recruited without sacrificing model performance whilst, at the same time, significantly improving computation time. By applying the recruitment approach to the training of federated models for accurate patient Length of Stay prediction using data from 189 Intensive Care Units, we show how the models trained in federations made up from recruited clients significantly outperform federated models trained with the standard procedure in terms of predictive power and training time.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent machine learning and deep learning techniques have proven to be of significant value for healthcare applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. An abundance of medical data is continuously generated, especially in Intensive Care Units (ICU) where patients are monitored uninterrupted and vitals are charted continuously. Deep learning techniques are particularly good at extracting underlying complex relations in such large datasets, thus the vast amount of available data bodes well for the data hungry models. One of the main limitations in relation to medical data of any sort relates to data availability. The vast amounts of data are rarely aggregated on a central server where models can be trained. As a result of regulatory restrictions both in Europe through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and more recently the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, and the United States with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> imposing similar restrictions, data sharing poses a significant challenge in the medical sector. In both cases, sharing and centrally accumulating privacy-sensitive data is bounded by a legal framework, necessary to protect privacy of the individuals behind the data. This, however, poses a challenge for research and application oriented tasks that require large amounts of medical data. In practice, this often translates to significant delays as data sharing agreements need to be put in place and agreed upon by the stakeholders and their corresponding legal teams.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the value of federated learning (FL) has been illustrated for medical applications, especially in the field of computer vision for medical image segmentation and classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Here, the FL approach allows to learn complex models over decentralized data without direct access to the data. In doing so, there is no need to centrally gather data, which enhances privacy preservation. Note that there is no strict guarantee for privacy preservation as membership inference attacks remain possible on federated architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The FL approach, however, comes with a new set of challenges. In the real world, decentralized data is often not independent and identically <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(non-IID)</span> distributed which harms the training procedure and model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The reduced performance can mainly be attributed to the weight divergence in local models as a result of the <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">non-IID</span> data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Selection procedures of federated training algorithms may select those contributors whose data is most informative at training time. This, however, requires all potential contributors to form part of the federation and participate in at least one round of training. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the foundations are provided for a client recruitment process which precedes the initiation of the federation. This aims at building the federation with those clients for which it can, a priori, be said that their contributions to the federation will be valuable. More specifically, clients for which the local data does not form a good representation of the population are considered less representative and therefore, of less value to the federation. Intuitively, when aiming for accurate global predictive performance, less representative clients result in higher weight divergence in the local models at training time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which harms the training procedure and the predictive power of the resulting global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Whilst in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a sound optimization framework is provided for client recruitment, in this work, the central research objective is to investigate <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">whether a subset of clients can be recruited by only looking at the local target distribution and sample size with the aim to train better performing federated models whilst reducing training time</span>. From the recruited subset of clients which are expected to yield better performing models naturally follows that overall training time is expected to reduce as well.</p>

For this work, we consider the <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> algorithm with random client selection as the standard FL approach and show how federated models for which only recruited clients partake in the federation significantly outperform the models trained using the standard approach in terms of predictive power and training time.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning was originally proposed by McMahan et al. in 2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> in conjunction with the <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> algorithm and has since been proven to be a valuable learning framework that can yield accurate models without direct access to the local data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A significant amount of research efforts have been dedicated to the client selection problem. Client selection in FL deals with client scheduling for each round of training, i.e., for each training round a subset of clients is selected that will contribute in the next training iteration. The standard approach is to randomly select this subset. However, as argued in multiple studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a better approach is to impose criteria based upon which client selection can be performed. These criteria often relate to how informative updates from certain clients are, or the local computational resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. This, however, does not allow for noninformative clients to be pre-excluded from the federation, which is where client recruitment, as extensively discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, comes in. Client recruitment aims to discard potential clients from the set of available clients for the federation, prior to initiation of the latter. One of the ways to do so is by considering limited statistics on the local dataset that do not contain privacy sensitive information. By pre-excluding potential clients, the foremost benefit is that the overall cost of training a model in the federated setting is reduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> without sacrificing predictive performance. In addition, optimally, the less informative clients are pre-excluded which results in increased predictive performance for the resulting global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL originates in the large-scale distributed edge computing setting, it has been extensively studied in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Specifically the work discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> closely relates to the work proposed here. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> the authors extensively assess different parameter settings for federated training on medical ICU data to identify suitable parameters for In Hospital Mortality (IHM) binary classification. In this study, we tackle a different problem, i.e., ICU LoS prediction, using the same eICU dataset. The authors show that a larger number of local training epochs improves performance whilst reducing the training cost at once as a result of the reduced server-client communication. In this work we extend upon these previous works by proposing a client recruitment scheme using limited statistics on the local data, applied to the critical care setting.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Federated Learning Basics</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> is a technique that allows for a central model to be trained over distributed data that originate and are stored locally. This approach was originally proposed within the setting of large-scale distributed learning on mobile devices and has been widely used and researched in the medical sector given the privacy enhancing aspect as well a the regulatory restrictions on data sharing within the sector. Each local data source, e.g., a mobile phone or a server hosted at a hospital, is referred to as a <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client</span>. The group of clients that contribute to training a central model, including the central <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">server</span> is referred to as the <span id="S3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federation</span>. The central server orchestrates the learning process over the different clients following the predefined FL algorithm. In that sense, the central server is holistically responsible for (i) initiating the model; (ii) providing a copy of the model to all of the clients; (iii) aggregating over the received model parameters and (iv) send back the updated model to the clients. Each client locally trains the model for a predetermined number of epochs after which only the model parameters are sent back to the central server. In the standard <span id="S3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> considered in this work, local model parameters are averaged into the global model update. In addition, for each communication round, either all or a subset of the clients in the federation are randomly selected for training. We consider this the standard FL setting which comes with most out of the box implementations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the original setting, where FL was envisioned for large-scale distributed learning on mobile devices, i.e., thousands of clients partake in a single federation, the server-client communication results in significant overhead depending on the training parameters. In this work, the clients correspond to 189 hospitals where communication overhead is not the main concern. The main challenge tackled here relates to some extent to the concept of <span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client shift</span> in conjunction with the understanding that in the real-world, data from different hospitals is likely to be <span id="S3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">non-IID</span> distributed. More specifically, clients host data that originates from different hospitals in different geographic regions, each with potentially different demographic characteristics, etc. Depending on local sample size and training parameters, models may overfit to the local data and bias the global model when aggregating model parameters. These are common problems to FL training algorithms and have been tackled by introducing more involved aggregation algorithms such as <span id="S3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Weighted FedAvg</span> or smart client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Whilst FL allows to learn a central model from distributed medical data in a privacy enhancing manner, not all data at each of the hospitals are equally valuable. More specifically, smaller local sample sizes are less likely to represent the global distribution which will typically result in a larger empirical training loss, as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In addition, as a result of different local demographics, even larger local datasets could also diverge in distribution from the population, which will again reduce predictive performance. Existing client selection and aggregation algorithms provide partial solutions to these issues. These methods, however, require for all the clients to form part of the federation and for each client to have participated at least once in a training round. If not, the algorithms do not obtain the required information to guide the further aggregation and selection procedure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This work builds on the client recruitment work introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and the field of FL in healthcare with the aim to develop a method for client recruitment by looking only at the local distribution of the target variable and the local sample size. With this, the recruitment process aims to recruit clients for which the local data better represents the population before initiating the federation. This would intuitively lead to better performing models globally and reduced training time.</p>

counts locally and globally. In this work, the target corresponds to the patient LoS in fractional days. To facilitate the computation of the distribution divergence, ten bins are constructed with each bin corresponding to the number of target values (LoS in fractional days) that fall within that given bin.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FL procedure with and without client recruitment is simulated as a single process using the <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedML</span> framework as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. More specifically, at training time, the central server instance is initiated along with the number of clients that form part of the federation. The central server instance initiates the model architecture as described in <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Model architecture ‣ 4 Methods ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a> with the hyperparameters from Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.3 Central training ‣ 4 Methods ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and distributes a copy to each of the clients in the federation. The clients each train the model on local train and validation data for a predetermined number of epochs. Upon completion, the clients report the learned model parameters back to the central server. This process is considered as a single round of server-client communication. Next, the server aggregates the received model parameters according to the aggregation algorithm. By aggregating over the received parameters, the central server constructs an update of the model and subsequently samples clients that will contribute in the next round of training. This latter process is referred to as client selection. In this work, clients are either all considered in each round of training or a subset is randomly sampled consistent with the standard implementation of <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>.</p>

To this end, the eICU dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is used, covering over 200,000 eICU admissions to 208 US hospitals. The total admission count covers over 139,000 unique patients registered at one of the US hospitals between 2014 and 2015.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The dataset is made publicly available for research purposes and is particularly interesting for FL as it allows for the data to be mapped to the originating institution. The data is preprocessed in concordance with the preprocessing pipeline proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Due to limited space, we refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> for a detailed description of the pipeline. In summary, the first 24 hours of data post ICU admission for adult patients are extracted and used to predict LoS. Both temporal and static information are extracted, cleaned, re-sampled, imputed and one-hot encoded where needed. For patients with multiple recorded stays over the designated time period, only one of the stays is considered to avoid information leakage when obtaining train, test and validation splits. The summary statistics for the resulting data cohort are presented in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5 Data ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The results in <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 6.1 Client recruitment results ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> show the best performing models per metric in bold. When considering MSLE, which was used as the loss function for all models, the best performance amongst the federated models is obtained by Federated-AC. Here, all clients make up the federation and partake in each round of training. Note that the performance of Federated-AC is nearly identical to the central model in terms of MSLE. However, considering all clients at each round of training incurs significant overhead and slows down training, as illustrated by the high training time for Federated-AC. The second best performing model in terms of MSLE is Federated-SRC, trained with recruited clients, for which a subset was randomly sampled at each round of training. More specifically, from Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we note that 54 clients were recruited from which 5 were randomly sampled at each round of training. This model outperforms Federated-SC and Federated-ARC in terms of MAE, MSE, MSLE and training time, whilst being the best overall performer in terms of MAE and training time.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The improved training time is a direct result of the reduced number of clients recruited for the federation. The improved performance can be attributed to the fact that model training is subject to less noise in the data, again as a direct result of the client recruitment procedure. Therefore, more informative model updates are produced at each round of training, resulting in lower empirical loss, which in turn improves performance.</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the client recruitment approach allows for models to be trained that outperform the standard FL approach (e.g., Federated-SC) and perform on par or better than the centrally trained model depending on the metric of interest. In addition, the total training time is drastically reduced compared to either central or federated models without client recruitment. In this use case, the model with the lowest MAE is of most value to the ICU, which is obtained by the Federated-SRC model in a fraction of the required training time compared to the other models in the experiment. Thus, illustrating practical relevance of the client recruitment procedure for larger federations in a real-world, privacy-sensitive, setting.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This formulation is intuitively equivalent to the recruitment process being quality greedy (QG) in the former and quantity (data) greedy (DG) in the latter. The quality greedy recruitment strategy allows for clients with smaller sample sizes for which the output does not diverge significantly in distribution to be recruited. The contrary is true for the quantity greedy strategy in which the recruitment process neglects, to some extent, the distribution divergence in the output and favorably ranks clients with large local samples. Essentially, this approach explores performance in the extremes of the weighted function presented in (<a href="#S4.E4" title="In 4.2 Client Recruitment ‣ 4 Methods ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>).
The results in Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 6.2 Recruitment parameter effects ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> show how nor the quality greedy approach, nor the quantity greedy approach perform better than the Federated-SRC model shown in Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 6.1 Client recruitment results ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. In addition, we note how the data greedy approach results in increased training time due to the larger sample sizes in the local data of the recruited clients. The findings reported in Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 6.2 Recruitment parameter effects ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, when compared to the results for Federated-SRC in Tab. <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 6.1 Client recruitment results ‣ 6 Results and Discussion ‣ Client Recruitment for Federated Learning in ICU Length of Stay Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, show the value of combining both divergence and local sample size in the client recruitment process as neither of the extreme strategies outperform the combined approach.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present a client recruitment approach considering only the local output distribution and local sample size. In addition, we show practical relevance of the proposed method in the medical setting. By recruiting clients in function of the herein defined client-level representativeness, those clients with smaller sample size in combination with those for which the output distribution vastly diverges compared to that of the global data are pre-excluded from the set of potential clients for the federation. By applying client recruitment, the predictive performance of the federated models significantly increases compared to the models trained with the standard FL approach. In addition, training time was significantly reduced as a direct result of the reduced number of clients that partook in training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This work builds upon existing work in the FL domain applied to healthcare and client recruitment research. The approach and results reported in this work further add to the foundation for the relevance and importance of intelligent client recruitment strategies as this can be a driver for overall performance of the federated training procedure.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main limitation of this work stems from the introduction of the recruitment parameter, <math id="S8.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\gamma_{th}" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">γ</mi><mrow id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">h</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝛾</ci><apply id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑡</ci><ci id="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S8.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">ℎ</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.p1.1.m1.1c">\gamma_{th}</annotation></semantics></math>, which directly affects the number of clients recruited for the federation. In a real-world setting, tuning this parameter is not always feasible. In addition, the present work is executed in a simulated, single process environment, which does not affect the performance of the client recruitment scheme. However, this does mean that the improvement in training time is relative and the actual communication cost is not a factor.</p>

In addition, future work will evaluate performance in a real-world setting were data is hosted on actual servers corresponding to the hospitals in separate networks. Here, client recruitment is of even greater importance as it can greatly reduce the overall required server-client communication. Furthermore, future work will explore alternative recruitment strategies with a focus on sampling from diverse subgroups in the data and assess local performance of the federated models against models trained on the local data only. At last, in future work we will evaluate the performance of the herein proposed client recruitment strategy against the less widely adopted state-of-the-art aggregation and selection strategies in FL.</p>
