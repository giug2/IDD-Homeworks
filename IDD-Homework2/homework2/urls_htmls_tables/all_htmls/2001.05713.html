<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p"><em id="id5.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated edge learning</em><span id="id5.id1.2" class="ltx_text"> (FEEL) is a popular framework for model training at an edge server using data distributed at edge devices (e.g., smart-phones and sensors) without compromising their privacy. In the FEEL framework, edge devices periodically transmit high-dimensional stochastic gradients to the edge server, where these gradients are aggregated and used to update a global model.
When the edge devices share the same communication medium, the multiple access channel (MAC) from the devices to the edge server induces a communication bottleneck. To overcome this bottleneck, an efficient broadband analog transmission scheme has been recently proposed, featuring the aggregation of analog modulated gradients (or local models) via the waveform-superposition property of the wireless medium. However, the assumed linear analog modulation makes it difficult to deploy this technique in modern wireless systems that exclusively use digital modulation. To address this issue, we propose in this work a novel digital version of broadband over-the-air aggregation, called <em id="id5.id1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">one-bit broadband digital aggregation</em> (OBDA). The new scheme features one-bit gradient quantization followed by digital <em id="id5.id1.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">quadrature amplitude modulation</em> (QAM) at edge devices and over-the-air majority-voting based decoding at edge server. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of wireless channel hostilities (channel noise, fading, and channel estimation errors) on the convergence rate of the proposed FEEL scheme. The analysis shows that the hostilities slow down the convergence of the learning process by introducing a scaling factor and a bias term into the gradient norm. However, we show that all the negative effects vanish as the number of participating devices grows, but at a different rate for each type of channel hostility.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Edge learning refers to the deployment of learning algorithms at the network edge so as to have rapid access to massive mobile data for training <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">artificial intelligence</em> (AI) models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
A popular framework, called <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</em> (FEEL), distributes the task of model training over many edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Thereby, FEEL exploits distributed data without compromising their privacy, and furthermore leverages the computation resources of edge devices. Essentially, the framework is a distributed implementation of <em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stochastic gradient descent</em> (SGD) in a wireless network.
In FEEL, edge devices periodically upload locally trained models to an edge server, which are then aggregated and used to update a global model. When the edge devices participating in the learning process share the same wireless medium to convey local updates to the edge server, the limited radio resources can cause severe congestion over the air interface, resulting in a communication bottleneck for FEEL. One promising solution is <em id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">over-the-air aggregation</em> also called <em id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">over-the-air computation</em> (AirComp) that exploits the waveform superposition property of the wireless medium to support simultaneous transmission by all the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Compared with conventional orthogonal access schemes, this can dramatically reduce the required resources, particularly many devices participate in FEEL. However, the uncoded linear analog modulation scheme used for over-the-air aggregation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> may cause difficulty in their deployment in existing systems, which typically use digital modulation (e.g., 3GPP).
In this work, we propose a new design, called <em id="S1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">one-bit broadband digital aggregation</em> (OBDA), that extends the conventional analog design by featuring digital modulation of gradients to facilitate efficient implementation of FEEL in a practical wireless system. We present a comprehensive convergence analysis of OBDA to quantify the effects of channel hostilities, including channel noise, fading and estimation errors, on its convergence rate. The results provide guidelines on coping with the channel hostilities in FEEL systems with OBDA.</p>

In the first step, the edge server broadcasts the current version of the global model to the participating edge devices. Each edge device employs SGD using only locally available data. In the next step, edge devices convey their local updates (gradient estimates or model updates) to the edge server.
Each iteration of these two steps is called one <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">communication round</em>. The iteration continues until the global model converges.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The communication bottleneck has already been acknowledged as a major challenge
in the federated learning literature, and several strategies have been proposed to reduce the communication overhead. We can identify three main approaches. The first is to discard the updates from slow-responding edge devices (stragglers) for fast update synchronization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Another approach is to employ update significance rather than the computation speed to schedule devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Update significance is measured by either the model variance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, or the gradient divergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> corresponding to model-averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and gradient-averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> implementation methods, respectively.
 The last approach focuses on update compression by exploiting the sparsity of gradient updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and low-resolution gradient/model-parameter quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
However, all these approaches assume reliable links between the devices and the server and ignore the wireless nature of the communication medium.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The envisioned implementation of FEEL in practical wireless networks requires taking into account wireless channel hostilities and the scarcity of radio resources. The first works in the literature that studied FEEL taking into account the physical layer resource constraints focus on over-the-air aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, a broadband over-the-air aggregation system based on analog modulation called <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">broadband analog aggregation</em> (BAA) is designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, where the gradients/models transmitted by devices are averaged over frequency sub-channels. For such a system, several communication-learning tradeoffs are derived to guide the designs of broadband power control and device scheduling. Over-the-air aggregation is also designed for narrow-band channels with an additional feature of gradient dimension reduction exploiting gradient sparsity in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Subsequently, <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">channel-state information</em> (CSI) requirement for over-the-air aggregation is relaxed by exploiting multiple antennas at the edge server in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
The joint design of device scheduling and beamforming for over-the-air aggregation is investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to accelerate FEEL in a multi-antenna system.
Few other recent works focus on radio resource management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a hierarchical FEEL framework is introduced in a cellular network.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a novel bandwidth allocation strategy is proposed for minimizing the model training loss of FEEL via convergence analysis accounting for packet transmission errors. Different classic scheduling schemes, such as proportional fair scheduling, are applied in a FEEL system and their effects on the convergence rate are studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With over-the-air aggregation, the edge server receives an approximate (noisy version) of the desired functional value, efficiently exploiting the available bandwidth by simultaneous transmission from all the devices, as opposed to orthogonalized massive access. The idea of over-the-air aggregation has previously been studied in the context of data aggregation in sensor networks, known also as AirComp. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, function computation over a MAC is studied from a fundamental information theoretic point of view, assuming <em id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">independent and identically distributed</em> (i.i.d.) source sequences, and focusing on the asymptotic computation rate. This is extended in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to wireless MACs and a more general class of non-linear functions. A practical implementation is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
From an implementation perspective, techniques for distributed power control and robust design against channel estimation errors are proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, respectively.

The problem formulation follows the standard in the existing federated learning literature (see e.g., [3]-[22]). Note that the formulated problem for model training is a stochastic problem as we construct the loss function using a randomly sampled subset of data, and the minimization of the loss function is solved by <em id="footnote1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">stochastic gradient decent</em> (SGD). The statistical distribution of the stochastic gradient estimate is assumed to satisfy Assumption 3, which is a widely-adopted assumption for tractable convergence analysis for non-convex loss functions. Note that the SGD approach can also handle online training scenarios where the dataset is collected sequentially in real-time.</span></span></span></span>
One way to do this is to upload all the local datasets to the edge server, and solve the problem in a centralized manner. However, this is typically undesirable due to either privacy concerns, or the sheer size of the datasets.

We assume that a fixed digital constellation is employed by all the devices to transmit over each sub-channel. Thus, each device needs to transmit its local gradient estimate using a finite number of digital symbols. This requires quantization of the local gradient estimates, and mapping each quantized gradient element to one digital symbol to facilitate the proposed OBDA.

Indeed, we employ 4-QAM modulation for the numerical experiments in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Simulation results ‣ One-Bit Over-the-Air Aggregation for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning: Design and Convergence Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For both MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, the effectiveness of the OBDA is evaluated in the three considered scenarios, namely over an AWGN MAC, and fading MACs with and without perfect CSI, which represent three levels of wireless hostilities. Test accuracy is plotted as a function of the number of communication rounds in Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Effect of Device Population ‣ VI Simulation results ‣ One-Bit Over-the-Air Aggregation for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning: Design and Convergence Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The proposed OBDA scheme converges in all three scenarios, but at different rates depending on the level of wireless hostility the scheme suffers from.
In the presence of channel fading the convergence is slower compared with its counterpart over an AWGN channel. This is because part of the gradient signs corresponding to subchannels experiencing deep fade are truncated, rendering a smaller number of effective participating devices for each gradient entry.
The imperfect CSI further slows down the convergence of the proposed OBDA. This is due to inaccurate aggregation, which results in a deviated gradient for model updating. These observations are aligned with our analysis presented in Theorems <a href="#Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ IV-B Convergence Analysis ‣ IV Convergence Analysis for OBDA over AWGN Channels ‣ One-Bit Over-the-Air Aggregation for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning: Design and Convergence Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>-<a href="#Thmtheorem3" title="Theorem 3. ‣ V-B Convergence Rate with Imperfect CSI ‣ V Convergence Analysis for OBDA over Fading Channels ‣ One-Bit Over-the-Air Aggregation for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning: Design and Convergence Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

The reason behind the faster convergence of digital OFDMA w.r.t. BAA is that the direct exposure of the analog modulated signals in BAA to the channel hostilities results in a boosted expected gradient norm as mentioned in Remarks 1-3. The performance gap between the BAA and OBDA in terms of convergence speed arises from the quantization loss introduced by the latter.
However, we observe that the gap between the two is small, which shows that over-the-air gradient aggregation can be employed with devices employing simple 4-QAM modulation without significant performance loss w.r.t. analog aggregation. Moreover, Fig. <a href="#S6.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ VI-C Performance Comparison: OFDMA, BAA and OBDA ‣ VI Simulation results ‣ One-Bit Over-the-Air Aggregation for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning: Design and Convergence Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a> shows that, without compromising the learning accuracies, the <em id="S6.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">per-round communication latencies</em> for both OBDA and BAA are independent of the number of devices, while that of the digital OFDMA scales up as the device

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of FEEL, we have proposed a novel digital over-the-air gradient aggregation scheme, called
OBDA, for communication-efficient distributed learning across wireless devices. To understand its performance, a comprehensive convergence analysis framework for OBDA subject to wireless channel hostilities is developed. This work represents the first attempt to develop digital AirComp, which is more practical, compared to its analog counterpart, in terms of the compatibility with the modern digital communication infrastructure. For future work, we will consider the generalization of the current work to multi-cell FEEL, where the effect of inter-cell interference should also be taken into account.
As another interesting direction, the proposed design assuming a single learning task can be extended to the multi-task learning scenario, where an additional task scheduler at the server needs to be designed in an effort to reducing the frequency of the gradient updates, further accelerating the learning process.</p>
