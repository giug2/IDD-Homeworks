<p id="5.1" class="ltx_p">The pervasive adoption of Internet-connected digital services has led to a growing concern in the personal data privacy of their customers. On the other hand, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely adopted by digital service providers to improve operational productivity and customer satisfaction. ML inevitably accesses and processes users’ personal data, which could potentially breach the relevant privacy protection regulations if not performed carefully. The situation is exacerbated by the cloud-based implementation of digital services when user data are captured and stored in distributed locations, hence aggregation of the user data for ML could be a serious breach of privacy regulations. In this backdrop, Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging area that allows ML on distributed data without the data leaving their stored location. Typically, FL starts with an initial global model, with each datastore uses its local data to compute the gradient based on the global model, and uploads their gradients (instead of the data) to an aggregation server, at which the global model is updated and then distributed to the local data stores iteratively. However, depending on the nature of the digital services, data captured at different locations may carry different significance to the business operation, hence a weighted aggregation will be highly desirable for enhancing the quality of the FL-learned model. Furthermore, to prevent leakage of user data from the aggregated gradients, cryptographic mechanisms are needed to allow secure aggregation of FL. Previous works on FL mainly focus on the FL framework and mechanisms for weighted aggregation. In this paper, we propose a privacy-enhanced FL scheme for supporting secure weighted aggregation. Besides, by devising a verification protocol based on Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), the proposed scheme is capable of guarding against fraudulent messages from FL participants. Experimental results show that our scheme is practical and secure. Compared to existing FL approaches, our scheme achieves secure weighted aggregation with an additional security guarantee against fraudulent messages with an affordable 1.2 times runtime overheads and 1.3 times communication costs.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The pervasive adoption of Internet-connected digital services has led to a growing concern in personal data privacy of their customers. On the other hand, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely adopted by digital service providers to improve operational productivity and customer satisfaction. ML inevitably accesses and processes users’ personal data, which could potentially breach the relevant privacy protection regulations if not performed carefully. The situation is exacerbated by the cloud-based implementation of digital services when user data are captured and stored in distributed locations, hence aggregation of the user data for ML could be a serious breach of privacy regulations. Such a scenario where multiple data stores (or custodians) jointly solve a machine learning problem while complying with privacy regulations has attracted tremendous attention from academia and industry. Privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy (DP), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and secure multi-party computation (MPC) are widely believed to be promising approaches to achieve this goal. However, it is well known that DP requires a tradeoff between data usability and privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, while MPC and HE offer cryptographic privacy with high communication or computation overheads.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this backdrop, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is an emerging area that allows ML on distributed data without the data leaving their stored location. For example, an international bank typically has data centres in multiple countries, domestic regulations of each country may not allow the bank to move customer data out of the jurisdiction; hence FL will be a useful approach to allow ML overall distributed data through the participation of all local data centres. Typically, FL starts with an initial global model, with each data store (in the respective data centre) uses its local data to compute the gradient based on the global model, and uploads their gradients (instead of the data) to an aggregation server, at which the global model is updated and then distributed to the local data stores iteratively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, depending on the nature of digital services and FL systems, data captured at different locations may exhibit disparity. For instance, digital inclusion may vary from country to country and, due to the need for service localization, the type of collected data may also be different. Besides, the technical competence of local personnel may also vary, thus ML at local data stores may suffer from label biases. This means that different local datasets may have different significance to the global FL model, and thus the organization’s business operation. Hence a weighted aggregation scheme will be highly desirable for enhancing the quality of the FL-learned model. In this case, the central server is required to evaluate the disparity across all local datasets in order to compute the weightings, and then aggregate all the clients’ locally trained models according to their weights. To calculate the weight, measurements on data size and data quality are widely adopted. For example, in the most popular FL approach FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the locally trained models from users are weighted by the percentage of their data size in the total training data. Based on FedAvg, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> further evaluate clients’ label quality by calculating the mutual cross-entropy between data and models of both the central server and clients. Although approaches in previous works resulted in a good performance in dealing with disparity across local datasets and improved the accuracy of the global FL model, they did not address the privacy guarantee for clients’ data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, from the angle of privacy protection, digital service providers need to address another important issue of FL, that is the feasibility of information leakage from the gradients. As pointed out in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, it is possible to derive the local training data from the publicly shared gradients, or models, in a multi-node machine learning system such as an FL system. Experimental results showed that such deep leakage from gradients allows the attacker to achieve pixel-wise accurate recovery for images and token-wise matching for texts in common computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Secure aggregation schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> aim to deal with this issue. However, during the FL process, the distributed data stores and the central server may still receive fraudulent messages due to insider frauds, which may affect the accuracy of the global FL model. For example, consider an enterprise FL system. FL participants are required to annotate the data with labels, and then train their local models with the labeled data. The competence and productivity of each FL participant will have a non-trivial impact on the label quality of the training data, which should understandably carry different weights in the overall ML. The weights are calculated by the data disparity evaluation scheme as mentioned earlier. The larger weight usually serves as an indicator of the higher quality, hence the competence and productivity of the local personnel, and vice versa. In this case, an incompetent or dishonest employee may manipulate the computed weight and send fraudulent messages (by manipulating the weights) during data disparity evaluation so as to obtain a larger weight. In other cases, the FL participant may upload a fraudulent model to affect the distribution of the global FL model in the current FL round in order to increase its weight in the next FL round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Note that such an issue regarding fraudulent messages can be generalized to any FL system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In order to address the aforementioned issues, we propose a secure weighted aggregation scheme to deal with both data disparity, data privacy, and dishonest participants (who send fraudulent messages to manipulate the computed weights) in FL systems. Our scheme leverages on HE and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), and combines with a dropout-resilient secure aggregation scheme. To summarize, our contributions are the following:</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As data size and data quality vary across local datasets, an evaluation scheme for data disparity is essential in the FL system. In this work, we improve the label quality evaluation scheme proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> to illustrate how to construct an interactive evaluation scheme in a privacy-preserving manner.

Note that the user holds the private key, and the decryption of weight is on the user-side. Thus, according to the threat model we discussed earlier, the server would not send fraudulent encrypted weight to each user, but the user may perform fraudulent decryption of the weight. Therefore, only the correctness of the decryption of weight on the user-side needs to be guaranteed. We adopt a variant of the ZKPoPK scheme to achieve such a goal (see Section <a href="#S2.SS5.SSS2" title="2.5.2 Zero Knowledge Proof of Plaintext Knowledge. ‣ 2.5 Cryptographic Tools ‣ 2 Preliminaries and Supporting Protocols ‣ Secure Weighted Aggregation for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.5.2</span></a>). Besides, we notice that most of the HE operations for data disparity evaluation on the server-side are only with a ciphertext, i.e., encrypted data or model of the user, and a plaintext, i.e., server’s data or model. Thus, we can rely on the Paillier cryptosystem, which supports such HE operations instead of the less efficient Fully HE crypto-system (see Section <a href="#S2.SS5.SSS1" title="2.5.1 Paillier Crypto-system ‣ 2.5 Cryptographic Tools ‣ 2 Preliminaries and Supporting Protocols ‣ Secure Weighted Aggregation for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.5.1</span></a> and Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Data Disparity Evaluation ‣ 4 Secure Weighted Aggregation Protocol ‣ Secure Weighted Aggregation for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>).</p>

Note that the consistency check is adopted to deal with the issue regarding the central server assigning different views to honest clients, as mentioned earlier. Since we fully leverage this technique which is identical to the one used in the secure aggregation scheme, we describe it in Appendix <a href="#Pt0.A3" title="Appendix 0.C Consistency Check ‣ Secure Weighted Aggregation for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">0.C</span></a> and discuss the security of our proposed method in combination with consistency check, i.e., the maximum number of malicious adversaries allowed and the lower bound of the threshold <math id="S3.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> for Shamir scheme, in Appendix <a href="#Pt0.A4" title="Appendix 0.D Discussion on Tolerance ‣ Secure Weighted Aggregation for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">0.D</span></a>. We follow the secure aggregation scheme in our work because it can be simply extended to secure weighted aggregation by uploading weighted models. However, an issue exists that users may upload fraudulent weighted models to the server for their benefits. For example, the clients can upload well-designed fraudulent models to affect the distribution of the global model of the current round to increase their weights in the next round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Addressing such issues is not trivial as the solution may involve a complicated incentive mechanism and several protocols for security and privacy purposes. Luckily, since the real users’ models in ciphertext have already been uploaded to the server in the first phase, and the weight of each user are public, relying on the ZKPoPK algorithm, the server can require each user to prove the plaintext knowledge of its weighted model without conveying any information apart from the fact that whether the user uploads the real weighted model or not. We note that following the secure aggregation scheme, each weighted model <math id="S3.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="w_{i}\mathcal{M}_{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">w</mi><mi id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℳ</mi><mi id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1"><times id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.1"></times><apply id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝑤</ci><ci id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><apply id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.2">ℳ</ci><ci id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.3">𝑖</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1c">w_{i}\mathcal{M}_{i}</annotation></semantics></math> to be uploaded is masked by adding some randomness <math id="S3.p6.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="R_{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">R</mi><mi id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑅</ci><ci id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.3.m3.1c">R_{i}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Note that the dropped users in our scheme include both the users that do not pass PoKM and the users that drop out of the system. The results show that our scheme provides an additional security guarantee against fraudulent messages with affordable overheads compared to the previous works. In particular, our scheme achieves around 1.2 times in run time and 1.3 times in communication cost upon the state-of-the-art secure aggregation scheme Secagg+, which indicates the practicality of our scheme.

Note that the server’s run time is the run time of the whole FL system, and we treat the users who do not pass PoKE and PoKM as dropout users as demonstrated in Protocol <a href="#S4.protocol1" title="List of Protocol 1 ‣ 4.3 Discussion on Privacy and Security ‣ 4 Secure Weighted Aggregation Protocol ‣ Secure Weighted Aggregation for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In specific, we consider the ”worst-case” dropout scenario where the users drop out during PoKE in the first phase as the server has already completed the calculation of the weights, or PoKM in the second phase as the users have already uploaded their weighted models. We can observe that dropout users cause a significant increasement in the total run time because of the high cost of dealing with dropout users in the underlying secure aggregation scheme.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There have been several schemes proposed to perform privacy-preserving and dropout-resilient aggregation. The main idea of these schemes is to integrate FL with privacy-preserving techniques such as DP, HE, and MPC. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> propose a DP-based FL scheme that a level of noise is added to each client’s locally trained model before aggregation, and thus to hide clients’ data distribution. However, there is a trade-off between privacy loss and model performance.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the HE-based aggregation scheme, in every round of FL, each client’s locally trained model is encrypted before uploading. Then the central server aggregates the clients’ model in ciphertext using HE operations and publishes the result for decryption. In this scheme, the private key is distributed among all participants relying on a threshold HE crypto-system, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and several parties that more than a threshold number can jointly decrypt an encrypted message.
Although the HE-based scheme provides an exact solution for privacy-preserving aggregation compared with the DP-based scheme, it may incur infeasible cost overhead for a large-scale FL system as the underlying threshold crypto-system requires all participants to contribute to several expensive protocols. Besides, this scheme cannot deal with clients dropping out.</p>

Another variant TurboAgg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> divides clients into multiple groups and follows a multi-group circular structure for communication. FastSecAgg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> substitutes threshold secret sharing with FFT-based multi-secret sharing scheme.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a privacy-enhanced FL scheme for supporting secure weighted aggregation. Our scheme is able to deal with both data disparity, data privacy, and dishonest participants (who send fraudulent messages to manipulate the computed weights) in FL systems. The proposed scheme leverages on HE and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), and combines with a dropout-resilient secure aggregation scheme. Experimental results show that our scheme is practical and secure. Compared to existing FL approaches, our scheme achieves secure weighted aggregation with an additional security guarantee against fraudulent messages with affordable runtime overheads and communication costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For future research investigation, we will substitute the Paillier cryptosystem with other HE schemes such as CKKS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> in order to improve the efficiency of data disparity evaluation. Several other attacks such as membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and model inversion attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> will be taken into account for a more general threat model. Besides, other distributed machine learning schemes such as split learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> can be integrated to further reduce the computation overheads on the client-side to make FL more friendly to resource-constrained edge devices.</p>

Note that dropped users do not affect the privacy and security of step setup and step 0-3, as each client executes the protocol with the server independently. Therefore, the bounds of the number of malicious adversaries and threshold regarding tolerance still follow those of the secure aggregation scheme.</p>
