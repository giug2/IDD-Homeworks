<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a bibliometric analysis of the Mendeleev Periodic Table. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of Scopus based database using the keyword “Mendeleev Periodic Table". Our findings suggest that the Mendeleev Periodic Table is an influential topic in the field of Inorganic as well as Organic Chemistry. Future researcher may focus on expanding our analysis to include other bibliometric indicators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the Mendeleev Periodic Table in the chemistry-based scientific investigations and even in the field of astrochemistry.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Bibliometrics is the use of statistical methods to analyse books, articles and other publications, especially in scientific contents. Bibliometric methods are frequently used in the field of library and information science as a tool for finding the impact of publications using statistics. It involves collecting data, processing it and analysing from bibliographic database like Scopus, Web of Science or Google Scholar. In a way we can say that bibliometric analysis can be used to explore and analyse large volume of scientific data, unpack the evolutionary nuances of specific field and shed light on emerging areas in that field. There are several tools available for conducting analysis on bibliometric. It is an R tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, other than library science <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and business as well as administrative management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> nowadays there is a growing trend to exploit this effective tool in the other field also, e.g. ecology and evolutionary biology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, psychology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, anthropology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, public health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, criminology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, accountancy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, economics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and so on. Recently a successful application of bibliometrics has been noted in the biological system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> where the authors used a bibliometric analysis of an interdisciplinary research area in the context of the evolution of life-history theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above mentioned works based on the bibliometric analysis we have performed a study in the purview of basic science, especially in the field of chemistry. However, at this juncture we would like to recall the comment by the famous astrophysicist Carl Sagan who relates the basic chemistry to the astrophysics in the following unique manner: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Therefore, for the time being we start the present bibliometric study from the Mendeleev Periodic Table as our initial platform which we shall connect later on with the astrochemistry as well as cosmochemistry.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This investigation thus fundamentally identifies the main working field of research dynamics and indicates the overall directional trend for the future research. As per the best of our knowledge, there is no such study having bibliometric analysis on the Mendeleev Periodic Table available in the literature as the stepping stone towards the astrochemical arena. Therefore, the following queries will be served as the pathways for the present study by using bibliometric analysis: (1) What is the current publication trend in the field of the Mendeleev Periodic Table? (2) Who are the most influential authors and relevant journals in this field of the Mendeleev Periodic Table? (3) Which are the most productive countries and institutions involved in the Mendeleev Periodic Table? (4) Who are the most prolific authors and what is the author collaborating trend in the Mendeleev Periodic Table? (5) Which are the most influential works in this field of the Mendeleev Periodic Table?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The outline of the present work is as follows: in the Section 2 we have provided background of the bibliometric analysis (Sub-Section 2.1) and the Mendeleev Periodic Table (Sub-Section 2.2). Section 3 is a precursor of the methodology we have adopted in the investigation. In Section 4 we have dealt with the results and findings on different features of the bibliometric analysis in the research field of the Mendeleev Periodic Table, e.g. Country production (Sub-section 4.1), Core sources by Bradford’s Law (Sub-section 4.2), Author’s local impact by h-Index (Sub-section 4.3), Author’s production (Sub-section 4.4), Annual scientific production (Sub-section 4.5), Most global cited documents (Sub-section 4.6), Co-occurrence network (Sub-section 4.7), Most relevant authors and countries (Sub-section 4.8). Section 5 is devoted for discussion and conclusion along with some future scope of the present study.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The term <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">bibliometrics</span> was coined by Alan Pritchard in 1969 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. However, in the late 19th century first appearance of bibliometrics studies occurred. The first instance of the term bibliometrics was found as its French equivalent hidden in a section titled “Le Livre et la Mesure". The term bibliométric was first used by Paul Otlet in 1934 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and defined as “the measurement of all aspects related to the publication and reading of books and documents" <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The anglicized version bibliometrics was first used by Alan Pritchard in a paper published in 1969, titled "Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?" <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. He defined the term as "the application of mathematics and statistical methods to books and other media of communication. The concept of bibliometrics "stresses the material aspect of the undertaking: counting books, articles, publications, citations" <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Bibliometric analysis appeared at the turn of the 19th and the 20th century <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. These developments predate the first occurrence of the concept of bibiometrics by several decades. Alternative label was commonly used: bibliography statistics became especially prevalent after 1920 and continued to remain in use until the end of the 1960s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Early statistical studies of scientific metadata were motivated by the significant expansion of scientific output and the parallel development of indexing services of databases that made this information more accessible in the first place. Citation index was first applied to case law in the 1860s and their most famous example, Shepard’s Citations (first published in 1873) will serve as a direct inspiration for the Science Citation Index one century later <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, a Russian chemist was the most important donor to the early evolution of the periodic table. He is often referred as the Father of the Periodic Table. In 1869, after the spurning of Newland’s Octave Law came into focus of the Mendeleev Periodic Table <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. In this, elements were aligned on the basis of their atomic mass and chemical properties. He arranged the elements in groups and periods. Vertical columns are referred as groups and horizontal row as periods. He found out that elements were arranged in increasing order of atomic mass and constant occurrence of elements with similar properties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">During Mendeleev’s work, only 63 elements were investigated. After studying the properties of elements, he found that the properties of elements were related to atomic mass in a periodic way. He arranged the elements in such a pattern that elements with same properties come under same vertical column of the table. Mendeleev among chemical properties used formulae of hydrides and oxides as a basic criterion for classification.He took 63 cards and he wrote property of one element on each card. He makes a group of elements with similar properties and pinned it on the wall. He observed that elements were arranged in order of increasing atomic mass and elements with similar properties had periodic occurrence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">He articulated a periodic law based on his observations entitled “The properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses" <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. In his description of periodic table of 1871, he left gaps in which unknown elements would find their place in periodic table, believed by him. One of the demerits of this table is that increase in atomic mass was not regular while going from one element to other. Hence the number of elements yet to be discovered was not predictable. Two good review papers are available on the genesis of the Mendeleev Periodic Table in the following Refs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>

On the other hand, science mapping analysis identifies and analyzes the scientific performance of articles, authors, institutions, countries and journals based on the number of citations, reveals the trends of the field studied through the analysis of keywords, identifies and clusters scientific gaps from most recent publications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.</p>

Bradford in 1934 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. This law is also known as Bradford’s law of scattering or Bradford’s distribution as it describes to show the articles of a particular subject that are scattered through the mass of periodicals as has been described: “there are a few very productive periodicals, a larger number of more moderate producers, and a still larger number of constantly diminishing productivity” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. Here a graph is plotted against number of articles and source rank of articles using Bradford’s law (vide Fig. 2). It can be noted from the plot that the journal ‘Foundation of Chemistry’ has the highest number of articles among others and ‘Crystallography Reports’ has the least numbers.</p>

The method of constructing co-occurrence networks includes identifying keywords in the text, calculating the frequencies of co-occurrence and analysing the networks. Map represents the connection of various keywords to each other with lines. These lines signify the co-occurrence of keywords with each other in different papers in the considered data set collected from Scopus database. It is to be distinctively noted here that ‘Periodic Table’ is the main keyword which in turn related to atoms, molecules, chemical elements, bonds, electrons and so on which are co-related to each other.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Some of the salient features of the present investigations are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">(i) These analyses give a direction to researchers venturing into the area of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table by providing information on journals, authors, collaborators and countries that are prominent in this domain as well as co-occurrence network used in the research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">(ii) From the data we analysed we can infer that USA is the country that has the highest publication over time. One can observe from the relevant plot (vide Fig. 3) that Novaro is the highest productive author of time period 1989 to 2008. Also, it is evident that the year 2019 has the highest annual scientific publication in Mendeleev Periodic Table.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">(iii) The most globally cited document in the field of Mendeleev ’s Periodic Table is “Electron affinity of heavy elements" with 156 citations published in the “Journal of Chemical Physics". E.R. Scerri is the most relevant author of the time with the highest number of documents on periodic table. USA can be awarded as the most relevant country in term of publication. Results of annual scientific production and the most cited document have collected increasing interest in the field. It is important for the future researchers to explore the ideas that are needed to identify the research gap. The analysis of relevant author’s and countries indicates global interest in this domain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">(iv) Research can be attributed more powerful and impacting effect when it gives a global result. Such studies enable research students as well as scientists to collaborate with experts who are working globally. These results are valuable for finding research journals, articles and other issues present in the domain of periodic table in that time span which in turn will be beneficial for the coming generation to find out possible outcomes in the field of research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In connection to the scope for future study we would like to state here that in this paper, we only included the data which is based on Scopus database of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table containing Q1 and Q2 factor so the paper which are not indexed in Scopus are not included in research. Therefore, (i) the future researcher can collect more amount of data from other sources such as Web of Science and Google Scholar, (ii) more comprehensive research can be carried out by focusing on different network diagrams that are not studied out here, and (iii) a diversified study can be done by extending the time span of database selection where the data set can be studied comprehensively by including different network. Furthermore, one can study the astrochemistry problems based on the present structure where micro-chemical elements can be connected to the macro-objects under the periphery of cosmological realm. This aspect may be considered in one of our future projects on the astrochemistry research which we have started here via the Mendeleev Periodic Table.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We can summarise that bibliometric analysis is an influential tool to explore publishing trends and their relationship between communicated work. Furthermore, it helps in recognizing the most influential researches as well as researcher in the field as evident in the present study of the Mendeleev Periodic Table.</p>
