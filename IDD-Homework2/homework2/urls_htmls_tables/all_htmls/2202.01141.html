<p id="id21.id1" class="ltx_p">The recent advancement of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) contributed to robotics by allowing automatic controller design. The automatic controller design is a crucial approach for designing swarm robotic systems, which require more complex controllers than a single robot system to lead a desired collective behaviour. Although the DRL-based controller design method showed its effectiveness, the reliance on the central training server is a critical problem in real-world environments where robot-server communication is unstable or limited. We propose a novel Federated Learning (FL) based DRL training strategy (FLDDPG) for use in swarm robotic applications. Through the comparison with baseline strategies under a limited communication bandwidth scenario, it is shown that the FLDDPG method resulted in higher robustness and generalisation ability into a different environment and real robots, while the baseline strategies suffer from the limitation of communication bandwidth. This result suggests that the proposed method can benefit swarm robotic systems operating in environments with limited communication bandwidth, e.g., in high-radiation, underwater, or subterranean environments.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Swarm robotics is a field of study of how a large number of robots can coordinate for a common goal with local communication and decentralised control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
It is inspired by social insects that form swarms, such as ants that perform long-distance foraging using pheromones.
As social insects collectively conduct challenging tasks, which are impossible for single individuals, swarm robotic systems are prospective for the challenging missions under dynamic and complex environments, which are difficult for single robots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Swarm robotic systems have already been implemented for such missions or are expected to be developed in future.
For example, a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles (USV) for maritime environmental monitoring and border patrolling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, more diverse applications are expected in future, such as planetary exploration with miniature robot swarms, targeted drug delivery with microscopic robot swarms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and agri-robotic applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
To enable the aforementioned applications, recent research works tackled several issues for swarm robotics that can occur in real-robot deployments.
For example, a self-configured multi legged robot swarm have shown its potential in the terradynamically challenging environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and a swarm robotic system with block-chain technology demonstrated improved security of swarm robotic communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While the future of swarm robotics seems bright, there are significant technical challenges to be overcome for further development of swarm robotic systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
One of the significant challenges is how to design the individual behaviour of a robot in a swarm.
As swarm robotic systems do not use a centralised unit to control the entire swarm, careful design of individual controllers is essential to achieve desired swarm behaviours <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
The current most dominant strategy to design the behaviour of individual robots is the manual design method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
It derives individual behaviour rules heuristically from the target swarm behaviour and finds an optimal controller through iterative tuning.
This strategy is suitable for simple scenarios. However, it is highly challenging to manually derive individual controllers for more complicated tasks and complex environments.
Furthermore, manually derived controllers cannot adapt to environmental change <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to manual design method, automatic design method gives ability to individual robots to find the optimal behaviour autonomously without external intervention.
One of the automatic design methods to design swarm robotic controller is Reinforcement Learning (RL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
RL allows to find an optimal controller from interactions with the environment in a way that it maximises the total reward in a given mission period.
Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which uses deep neural networks as a function approximator, has been rapidly developed and showed the potential in diverse domains, e.g. multi-robot systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and self-driving cars <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
The effectiveness of DRL for swarm robotic system has been demonstrated e.g. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, where DRL considerably outperformed manual controller design in the navigation and collision avoidance tasks with up to 100 robots.
To overcome the limitation of manual design, researchers proposed and developed the automatic design method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
In contrast to the manual design method, the automatic design method allows individual robots to find the optimal behaviour autonomously without external intervention.

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although the feasibility and benefits of RL have been demonstrated and expected to produce more promising results as it develops, there is a critical issue in implementing RL for swarm robotic systems in real-world applications.
In the simulated environments, all data collected from individuals are used for training in a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
The dependence on a central server is present in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), which is a sub-domain of RL dealing with multi-agent scenarios.
In several MARL research works, centralised training and decentralised execution scheme is used for training multi-agent systems, e.g., COMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and MADDPG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Although the controllers used for each agent can differ, training is conducted in the centralised server.
However, perfect and high-bandwidth communication between large numbers of robots and a central server cannot be ensured in the real world.
Communication constraints apply to scenarios where robotic swarms would be especially effective, e.g., underwater inspection, extreme environment exploration, or subterranean search and rescue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
In the conditions of limited communication, a centralised, data-intensive way of training swarm robotic systems for real-world applications can become ineffective or even impossible.
Therefore, DRL training strategy that reduces communication bandwidth between a large number of robots and the central server is necessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for distributed training of machine learning models with a large number of agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
In an FL setting, each agent trains an individual model using locally collected data.
The individually trained models are then periodically shared with the central server that aggregates them and transmits a refined model back to the individual agents.
Since it does not share the sensorimotor data between the agents, it is used as a learning paradigm for domains where security and privacy are a concern, e.g., secure 5G networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and multi-institutional medical diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
This paradigm has three significant advantages for swarm robotic scenarios: i) major reduction in communication with the server, ii) privacy preservation and iii) customisation of models.
First, as each individual only communicates with the server to share the model, the volume of exchanged data can be considerably reduced compared to the conventional training methods.
Second, since it uses local sensorimotor data to train the local model and sends only the model, the local sensory data remain concealed within the agent.
This avoids security and privacy issues when deploying a swarm robotic system in strategic infrastructure facilities or public areas.
Finally, as the individual model is trained using the local data, it can better adapt to the individual characteristics of an actual agent.
In the real world, swarm robots are not identical, but they differ slightly due to the nature of their manufacturing and wear and tear during their operation.
With the great potential of integration of FL with DRL, FL-based DRL has been validated in a simple grid-world environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and internet-of-things applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
In a robotic application, it showed its advantages in navigation and collision avoidance scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
However, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> used only a single robot in different environments and trained it sequentially.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes an FL-based DRL training strategy for swarm robotic systems (FLDDPG).
We evaluate four DRL training strategies, including the FLDDPG, in both simulated and real-world scenarios, where a swarm of robots collectively learns to navigate towards given destinations while avoiding obstacles.
We focus our evaluation on the performance of these strategies under the limited communication bandwidth, which reflects a major challenge of real-world swarm robotic missions.
The obtained results from the experiments demonstrated that FLDDPG resulted in higher robustness and generalisation ability compared to the baseline strategies.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DRL training for swarm robotic systems requires two design choices: i) training algorithm and ii) training strategy.
Regarding the training algorithm, the question is what particular DRL algorithm is suitable for the given agent and environment.
For example, when continuous action is required for the agent, e.g. mobile robots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, DRL algorithm that outputs continuous values needs to be chosen, e.g., the DDPG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, PPO  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and TD3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
In contrast, when discrete actions are required, e.g. robot moves in a grid-like environment, DRL algorithm for discrete action needs to be used, e.g., DQN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>

Two factors need to be considered when choosing a suitable training strategy.

DDPG is an actor-critic, model-free DRL algorithm for agents with continuous observation and action spaces.
It is one of the successful DRL algorithms in continuous observation and action domains, e.g., mobile robots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, mobile edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and unmanned aerial vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
Since robots in a swarm require continuous observations and actions as the described application domains, we chose DDPG to train individual robot in a robot swarm.

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Shared Network DDPG (SNDDPG) is a training strategy that uses a shared neural network and a shared memory. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I INTRODUCTION ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Collective Navigation of Robotic Swarms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b) illustrates SNDDPG training strategy. In each time step, the robots transfer the transition sample data to the shared memory located in the central server. In every training period, the network update is performed by the central server and the model is distributed to the individual agents. The advantage of this method that the central server can be trained using the data samples collected by different agents in different environments. Compared to IDDPG, it encourages the networks to learn from more diverse data, leading to a more generalised controller. However, it requires frequent communication between each robot and the central server. The more frequent the communication between robots and the central server is required, the more vulnerable the training is as the communication is unstable.</p>

With the hard weight update method, the averaged weights are directly assigned to the local neural network weights. The problem of hard weight update method is that whenever the local weights are updated with the averaged weights, adverse change in neural network can occur, decreasing the efficiency of individual controllers in their corresponding environments and tasks after the update. To prevent such adverse changes in the neural network update after the weight update, we proposed a soft weight update method. The concept of soft weight update is that the local neural network weights are fractionally updated with the averaged weights.

four different training strategies, IDDPG, SEDDPG, SNDDPG

navigation and collision avoidance for swarm robotic systems.

Although the robots do not communicate each other for collective behaviours, the robots help other robots to obtain a better controller utilising diversity of collected samples and trained models for larger number of agents than a single robot.

the performance of a collectively learned model from the swarm
robotic systems rather than deploying multiple robots, which
can add a higher degree of complexity affecting the evaluation of
the trained model.</p>

period of 5 was chosen over the total 120 episodes as the

However, it is conducted with the smaller number of time steps per episode and different reward design than the main experiment in a fast manner to evaluate the performance of hard update and soft update only.

We found that the performance of each robot temporarily decreases after weight update with the averaged model using the hard update method. Since the averaged model generalises individual local models, its performance in each local environment varies. The result shows that the soft update method prevented the adverse conversion from the local model to the averaged model, resulting in faster training by 18% reducing training time compared to the hard weight update.</p>

This result means the overall training performance of the four agents is the lowest with IDDPG and the highest with FLDDPG. The performance of the trained models with different training strategies is more investigated with the evaluation experiments, described in Section IV-C and IV-D. One interesting observation in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Results of FLDDPG Design Experiments ‣ IV RESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Collective Navigation of Robotic Swarms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> (a) is that the average reward of SNDDPG fluctuates with greater amplitudes than other strategies. This observation about fluctuation is more quantitatively evaluated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Results of FLDDPG Design Experiments ‣ IV RESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Collective Navigation of Robotic Swarms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> (b).</p>

For the number of catastrophic interference, IDDPG and FLDDPG had the lowest value with 0.33 per training instance. SEDDPG resulted in a slightly higher value of 2. With SNDDPG, the number of catastrophic interference had the highest value with 5.33, which explains the dramatic fluctuation observed in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Results of FLDDPG Design Experiments ‣ IV RESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Collective Navigation of Robotic Swarms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> (a). For IDDPG, as the agents are trained independently, it is not affected by updated shared experience replay buffer or shared network update. Therefore, it resulted in a low number of catastrophic interference. For SEDDPG, as the experience replay buffer is updated with large intervals, and the data samples for each agent can drastically change. Also, during the intervals, individual networks are trained in a personalised way with the individual data, and the update of the experience replay buffer with the shared aggregate data can deteriorate the training of the models. This drastic change resulted in a higher number of catastrophic interference compared to IDDPG. For SNDDPG, during the intervals between updates, the agents collect samples with the fixed models. The fixed models can cause collecting only trivial data, which does not improve the model’s improvement when updated. Subsequently, the trained model with trivial data can cause the collection of other trivial data, forming a vicious cycle. Moreover, when the shared network is updated using the collected samples at large intervals, there could be a drastic change in the shared network. The collected samples with the non-improving model can store non-beneficial samples for network improvement.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For the number of failed agents, both SNDDPG and FLDDPG had no failed agents. However, IDDPG and SEDDPG resulted in 1.2 and 2 average number of failed agents per training instance, respectively. For IDDPG, there is no data exchange or model exchange mechanism so that one agent cannot benefit from other agents. Their failure happens as they do not have a sample or a neural network model generating samples that are beneficial to update a neural network model in an improving way. For SEDDPG, as their data transfer is limited due to the limitation on the total transferred data volume, the experience replay buffers are updated every 5 episodes. It can be presumed that this infrequent update of the experience replay buffer caused noise in the samples, thereby resulting in a higher number of failed agents. On the other hand, SNDDPG and FLDDPG contribute to individual agents getting benefits from the other agents by sharing samples to update the shared network and neural network parameters.</p>

By comparing the scores, it is shown that the average performance of models trained with SEDDPG is the lowest. This can be explained by the number of catastrophic interference and failed agents observed in the training performance (shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Results of FLDDPG Design Experiments ‣ IV RESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Collective Navigation of Robotic Swarms" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>).

Furthermore, the high number of catastrophic interference also negatively influenced the performance of the trained models, thereby causing a low success rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The effects of the number of catastrophic interference and failed agents are further shown with the success rates of SNDDPG and IDDPG, respectively. SNDDPG resulted in the greatest number of catastrophic interference while having no failed agents and IDDPG resulted in the comparably high number of failed agents while having the lowest number of catastrophic interference. Both SNDDPG and IDDPG scored 10% and 11%, which are considerably lower than the success rate of FLDDPG (26%).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to the three baselines, FLDDPG scored a higher success rate of 26%, which is approximately 2.36 times improvement than the second best method (IDDPG, 11%). This reason for this improvement can be supported by the significantly low number of catastrophic interference (0.33) and the absence of the failed agent. Furthermore, FLDDPG achieved a considerably short average completion time than other baselines, which is only approximately 60% of the second short average completion time (SEDDPG, 30.53 s). Both high success rate and short average completion time manifest the robustness and generalisation of FLDDPG.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the three sets of results, i) training performance, ii) evaluation in simulation and iii) evaluation with a real robot, it is found that the proposed FLDDPG strategy prevented failure of training of individuals in a collective learning scenario by aggregating the individual neural networks periodically compared to the independent learning scenario (IDDPG). Moreover, under the limitation of the communication bandwidth, FLDDPG showed greater robustness and generalisation ability by evaluation in the simulation and the real robot setting. This finding from the experimental results about FLDDPG suggests that FLDDPG can benefit the autonomous swarm robotic systems operating in uncertain environments where online learning is required under the limitation of communication bandwidth.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The examples of such environments are underground mines and tunnels, where swarm robotic systems are required to perform inspection or search-and-rescue missions.
The teams participating in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) subterranean challenge actually reported that one of the most difficult challenges was the limited communication bandwidth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, preventing the robots from efficiently exchange sensorimotor data.
Thus, we believe that the use of FLDDPG in similar scenarios would improve the robustness of the deployed multi- and swarm-robotic systems.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a federated learning-based deep reinforcement learning training strategy for swarm robotic systems, FLDDPG.
FLDDPG reduces their reliance on high-fidelity communications and protects confidentiality of the locally collected data.
Through the experiments in a collective learning scenario for navigation and collision avoidance under the limitation of communication bandwidth, FLDDPG showed higher robustness and better generalisation compared to the three baselines, IDDPG, SEDDPG and SNDDPG.
This finding is supported by both simulation and real-robot experiments.
The result suggests that FLDDPG can benefit autonomous swarm robotic systems operating in environments with the limited communication such as underground or underwater.
In the future, the federated learning based DRL training strategy with heterogeneous swarm robotic systems in the real, changing environments will be developed and investigated.</p>
