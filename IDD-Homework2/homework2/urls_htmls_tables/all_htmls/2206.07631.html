<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes using communication pipelining to enhance the wireless spectrum utilization efficiency and convergence speed of federated learning in mobile edge computing applications. Due to limited wireless sub-channels, a subset of the total clients is scheduled in each iteration of federated learning algorithms. On the other hand, the scheduled clients wait for the slowest client to finish its computation. We propose to first cluster the clients based on the time they need per iteration to compute the local gradients of the federated learning model. Then, we schedule a mixture of clients from all clusters to send their local updates in a pipelined manner. In this way, instead of just waiting for the slower clients to finish their computation, more clients can participate in each iteration. While the time duration of a single iteration does not change, the proposed method can significantly reduce the number of required iterations to achieve a target accuracy. We provide a generic formulation for optimal client clustering under different settings, and we analytically derive an efficient algorithm for obtaining the optimal solution. We also provide numerical results to demonstrate the gains of the proposed method for different datasets and deep learning architectures.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a promising distributed machine learning approach in which a central server (coordinator) and a number of data-holding clients cooperate in the training of a common machine learning model without exchanging data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Only model parameters are shared and updated using an iterative gradient descent algorithm. Hence, learning from private clients’ data becomes possible while preserving the privacy of the clients’.
Furthermore, federated learning enables achieving mutual benefits for all participating clients since training the algorithm using larger datasets by aggregating the private data of all participants leads to significant enhancements in the performance of data-hungry models. Moreover, federated learning enables better utilization of the distributed computational and storage resources. In particular, federated learning can be applied in mobile edge computing of wireless networks, e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Research in federated learning has many aspects. One of them is exploring the variations among distributed gradient-descent training algorithms and analyzing the convergence performance of these algorithms with respect to the number of local and global iterations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Another attractive research area is managing and optimizing the distributed computing and communication resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In particular, one of the main challenges in federated learning is the heterogeneity across the clients in terms of their computing and data resources.
In this work, we focus on enhancing the utilization efficiency of wireless spectrum in federated learning.
Consequently, enhancing the spectrum utilization leads to enhancing the prediction accuracy of the learning model at the end of the training process.
Hence, achieving a target prediction accuracy becomes possible with a fewer number of iterations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We propose using communication pipelining to enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency and speed up the convergence of federated learning. The primary motivation behind the proposed concept is that the computation time varies a lot between devices due to several reasons, such as different processor speeds or different sizes of the local dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
So, in an iterative gradient algorithm, the time of each iteration will be limited by the slowest client. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose that instead of just waiting for the slow clients to finish the computation of their local gradients, we can schedule an extra number of clients within the same iteration without requiring extra spectral bandwidth. A mixture of fast and slow clients should be scheduled in each iteration. The fast clients will use the spectrum first, while the slow clients are still running their computation of the local update. In this way, the number of clients who participate in each iteration can be increased while preserving the total duration of each iteration.
So, the main idea is to cluster clients based on their computation time and then schedule a balanced mixture of clients from different clusters.
The merit of this proposed concept is not necessarily in increasing the number of scheduled clients in each iteration but rather in allocating the wireless resources more efficiently. So, for example, fewer resources can be used while maintaining the number of clients per iteration. In principle, pipelining is an added degree of freedom in the resource allocation problem that can be adequately utilized to adjust the trade-off between allocated resources and the number of clients to be scheduled to achieve the best outcome of the federated learning process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is essential to highlight that the proposed concept of  <span title="pipelined federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_long">pipelined federated learning</span></span> (<abbr title="pipelined federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">PFL</span></abbr>) is a general concept that can be applied to any variation of the gradient descent algorithm, whether batch or stochastic, and for both primal or dual optimization methods.
In this paper, we just show, as an example, the formulation for a primal method with client sampling in each iteration and one local iteration of full-gradient (batch) computation in each global iteration.
We refer to this method as Clustered-Scheduling Gradient-Descent (CS-GD). The extension of the concept to other cases, such as having more local iterations per client, is straightforward as long as the needed computation time per client is quantified.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The application of federated learning is discussed in several studies, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
A seminal work on federated learning introducing the federated averaging algorithm is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Federated averaging algorithm aggregates the updated local weights from each client in each global iteration.
A comprehensive survey on federated learning is provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> by discussing the arising challenges, problems, and possible solutions regarding federated learning.
The idea of federated learning is applied to the traffic prediction in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the authors investigated the problem of client scheduling and resource block (RB) allocation to enhance the performance of model training using FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors adopted FL in wireless networks as a resource allocation optimization problem that captures the trade-off between FL convergence wall clock time and energy consumption of UEs with heterogeneous computing and power resources.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a novel over-the-air computation based-approach for fast global model aggregation via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel. This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design using the difference of convex function representation.
In the same direction, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed a novel digital version of broadband over-the-air aggregation, called one-bit broadband digital aggregation (OBDA), featuring one-bit gradient quantization followed by digital quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) at edge devices and over-the-air majority-voting based decoding at edge server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some other interesting works in the literature have considered the client scheduling problem, e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, three practical scheduling policies, which are random scheduling, round Robin scheduling, and proportional fair scheduling, were compared. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a probabilistic scheduling framework that considers both channel quality and local update importance was proposed. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a multi-armed bandit-based framework was proposed for online client scheduling. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, scheduling based on a metric called “age of information” was proposed, and in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, joint client scheduling and resource allocation was proposed.
The training and wireless transmission parameters are jointly optimized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
The works mentioned above do not take into consideration the variations in computational time among the clients. This is an essential factor to consider when scheduling the clients in order to avoid wasted time waiting for clients that need extended computing times.
This is the main motivation for this work.
The computational heterogeneity of the clients was considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In this work, we develop the concept further by introducing client clustering and communication pipelining.</p>

Each sub-channel consists of multiple sub-carriers, and the data packets may cover multiple OFDM frames in order to fit the exchanged gradient data between the clients and the server. The number of gradients may be in the order of a million since the deep learning architectures usually have a large number of trainable variables.
Furthermore, the total number of clients is assumed to be much larger than the number of sub-channels <math id="S2.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N\ll M" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p3.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">N</mi><mo id="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">≪</mo><mi id="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">M</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p3.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1">much-less-than</csymbol><ci id="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑁</ci><ci id="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3">𝑀</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p3.3.m3.1c">N\ll M</annotation></semantics></math>.

So, even if two clients have the same processor speed, a larger dataset will need a larger computation time than a client with a smaller dataset. This variation in computation time represents a practical consideration.
On the other hand, since the packet size for communicating a local update to the server is the same across all clients (and it depends on the size of the gradient vector <math id="S2.p4.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{g}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p4.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.p4.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝐠</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p4.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p4.2.m2.1.1">𝐠</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p4.2.m2.1c">\mathbf{g}</annotation></semantics></math>), the communication time is considered to be the same for all clients.
We know that wireless channels’ quality differs among different users due to small-scale and large-scale fading. So, some studies in the literature have taken the channel quality into consideration in the selection of the clients per iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, in this work, we do not want to compromise machine learning best practices for other advantages related to opportunistic communication in order to enhance transmission data rate. Hence, we design a system that can give all clients an almost equal chance to be selected. In particular, we aim to use the largest possible amount of data in training by involving all clients and learning a model that is not biased towards the data of only a subset of the clients who get selected more frequently than others.
In our communication scheme, we assume that the communication over the sub-channels applies a fixed rate that is independent of the particularly selected user. We assume that the fixed transmission rate can be reliably decoded by all users. This is a common scheme in practical communication systems. The wireless channel data rate efficiency could be enhanced by applying adaptive modulation and coding based on the channel conditions. However, this is out of the scope of this manuscript.

However, this is not a good option since those clients are likely to be the clients with the largest datasets, and hence, their local updates have higher weights (i.e., they have higher importance).
Furthermore, it is advantageous to involve more data samples in the training process in order to enhance the overall learning accuracy.
So, client exclusion is not recommended. Instead, client scheduling in each global iteration should be based on random sampling so that each client gets a chance to be involved in each global iteration.
On the other hand, just waiting for the slowest client to finish its computation is a waste of the valuable spectral resources since the utilization efficiency <math id="S2.p5.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p5.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.p5.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p5.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p5.2.m2.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p5.2.m2.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math> of the <math id="S2.p5.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p5.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S2.p5.3.m3.1.1" xref="S2.p5.3.m3.1.1.cmml">N</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p5.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S2.p5.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p5.3.m3.1.1">𝑁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p5.3.m3.1c">N</annotation></semantics></math> uplink sub-channels will be</p>

When we obtain a relaxed (continuous-valued) number of clients per cluster, it is clear that the optimal value in the discrete domain should be by rounding the relaxed number of clients to the nearest integer. Any other value will give a higher variance. Furthermore, rounding to the lower or upper integer will give equal value. So, for example, if we have 7 users and want to distribute them into two groups. The optimal relaxed value will be 3.5 per group. If we round this value, we could have the first group has 4 and the second group has 3, or the first group has 3 and the second group has 4. Both solutions have exactly the same variance. So, in principle, rounding the nearest integer will always be optimal, although it may not be the unique optimal solution.

This can be particularly useful for scenarios of large <math id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>.
However, before discussing the search algorithm, we will give numerical examples of hypothesis testing to clarify the concept. Then, we will formulate the hypothesis testing procedure in a systematic way that can be implemented in an algorithm.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the main challenges of federated learning is the heterogeneity across the participating clients in terms of their computation duration and the size of the local data set.
To mitigate this challenge, we have proposed using communication pipelining to enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency and speed up the convergence of federated learning. The main idea is to cluster clients based on their computation time and then schedule a balanced mixture of clients from the different clusters.
The faster clients access the spectrum first, while the slower clients are still running their computation.
By allowing more clients to be involved in each iteration, the time required to converge into a targeted prediction accuracy of the trained model can be reduced significantly.
The time per iteration does not change in comparison with conventional federated learning. Nevertheless, the required number of iterations and the total time to train the model are reduced.
We provided a generic formulation for the optimal client clustering under different settings and an efficient algorithm for obtaining the optimal solution.
We demonstrated that the required number of communication rounds also depends on the number of sub-channels, and the gain obtained from the proposed method is lower for a high number of sub-channels.</p>
