<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning (FL), devices contribute to the global training by uploading their local model updates via wireless channels. Due to limited computation and communication resources, device scheduling is crucial to the convergence rate of FL. In this paper, we propose a joint device scheduling and resource allocation policy to maximize the model accuracy within a given <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">total training time</em> budget for <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">latency constrained</em> wireless FL. A lower bound on the reciprocal of the training performance loss, in terms of the number of training rounds and the number of scheduled devices per round, is derived. Based on the bound, the accuracy maximization problem is solved by decoupling it into two sub-problems. First, given the scheduled devices, the optimal bandwidth allocation suggests allocating more bandwidth to the devices with worse channel conditions or weaker computation capabilities. Then, a greedy device scheduling algorithm is introduced, which in each step selects the device consuming the least updating time obtained by the optimal bandwidth allocation, until the lower bound begins to increase, meaning that scheduling more devices will degrade the model accuracy. Experiments show that the proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art scheduling policies under extensive settings of data distributions and cell radius.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to Cisco’s estimation, nearly 850 zettabytes of data will be generated each year at the network edge by 2021 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
These valuable data can bring diverse artificial intelligence (AI) services to end users by leveraging deep learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which are developing rapidly in recent years.
However, training AI models (typically deep neural networks) via conventional centralized training methods requires aggregating all raw data to a central server.
Since uploading raw data via wireless channels can drain the wireless bandwidth and cause privacy issues when the raw data are uploaded to the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, it is hardly practical to use conventional centralized training methods in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned issues, researchers have proposed a new distributed model training framework called Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
A typical wireless FL system leverages the computation capabilities of multiple end devices, which are coordinated by a central controller, for example a base station (BS), to train a model in an iterative fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
In each iteration of FL (also known as a round), the participating devices use their local data to update the local models, and then the local models are sent to the BS for global model aggregation.
By updating the model parameters locally, FL leverages both the data and computation capabilities distributed on devices, and hence can reduce the model training latency as well as preserving the data privacy.
Therefore, FL becomes a promising technology for distributed data analysis and model training in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and has been used in many applications, for instance, resource allocation optimization in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and content recommendations for smartphones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, implementing FL in real wireless networks encounters several key challenges that have not been fully resolved yet.
Due to the scarce spectrum resources and stringent training latency budget, only a limited number of devices are allowed to upload local models in each round, where the device scheduling policy becomes crucial and can affect the convergence rate of FL in two ways.
On the one hand, in each round, the BS cannot perform the global model aggregation until all scheduled devices have finished updating their local models and uploading the local model updates.
Therefore, straggler devices with limited computation capabilities or bad channel conditions can significantly slow down the model aggregation.
As a result, scheduling more devices leads to a longer latency per round, due to the reduced bandwidth allocated to each scheduled device and a higher probability of having straggler devices.
On the other hand, scheduling more devices increases the convergence rate w.r.t. the number of rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and can potentially reduce the number of rounds required to attain the same accuracy.
Therefore, if we look at the total training time, which is the number of rounds times the average latency per round, the device scheduling is essential and should be carefully optimized to balance the latency per round and the number of required rounds.
Moreover, the scheduling policy should also adapt itself to the dynamic wireless environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, implementing FL in wireless networks has received many research efforts.
To reduce the uploading latency introduced by global model aggregation, novel analog aggregation techniques have been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
For analog aggregation, the scheduled devices concurrently transmit their local models via analog modulation in a wireless multiple-access channel, and thus the BS receives the aggregated model thanks to the waveform-superposition property.
Although the uploading latency can be greatly reduced, stringent synchronization among devices is required.
While for digital transmission based FL, the scheduled devices need to share the limited wireless resources and the resource allocation problems have been studied by a series of work.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> adopt TDMA for the MAC layer, and jointly optimize the device CPU frequency, the transmission latency, and the local model accuracy to minimize the weighted sum of training latency and total device energy consumption.
A similar FL system but with FDMA is considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, the frequency of global aggregation under heterogeneous resource constraints has been optimized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, all devices are involved in each round, which is hardly feasible in practical wireless FL applications due to the limited wireless bandwidth.
Another series of work proposes to use device scheduling to optimize the convergence rate of FL.
A heuristic scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel states and the importance of local updated models, is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
However, the proposed scheduling policy is only evaluated by experiments and the convergence performance cannot be theoretically guaranteed.
A greedy scheduling policy is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> that schedules as many devices as possible within a given deadline for each round.
Nevertheless, the deadline is chosen through experiments and can hardly be adapted to dynamic channels and device computation capabilities.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors exploit an intuition that the convergence rate of FL increases linearly with the number of scheduled devices, and accordingly an energy-efficient joint bandwidth allocation and scheduling policy is proposed.
The relation between the number of rounds required to attain a certain accuracy and the scheduling policy is derived in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and three basic scheduling policies, namely random scheduling, round-robin, and proportional fair, are compared.
However, due to the complicated relation between the number of rounds required to attain a certain accuracy and the per round latency, the convergence rate w.r.t. <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the number of rounds</em> obtained by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> cannot be directly transformed into the convergence rate w.r.t. <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">time</em>.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> jointly optimize the uplink resource block allocation and transmission power to maximize the <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">asymptotic</em> convergence performance of FL, while the performance can hardly be guaranteed for latency constrained wireless FL applications.
Therefore, the model accuracy within certain training time budgets (i.e., convergence rate w.r.t. <em id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">time</em>), which is critical for latency constrained FL applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, has not been addressed yet.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we aim to optimize the convergence rate of FL w.r.t. <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">time</em> rather than the number of rounds.
Specifically, we formulate a joint bandwidth allocation and scheduling problem to maximize the accuracy of the trained model, and further decouple the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., bandwidth allocation and device scheduling.
For the bandwidth allocation problem, assuming a given set of scheduled devices, the implicit optimal solution that minimizes the latency of the current round is first obtained, and an efficient binary search algorithm is proposed to numerically get the optimal bandwidth allocation and the corresponding round latency.
For the device scheduling problem, by relaxing the objective into minimizing the upper bound of the loss function based on a derived convergence bound that incorporates device scheduling,
we design a greedy algorithm that adds devices one by one with the shortest updating time to the scheduled devices set, until the convergence bound begins to increase, meaning that scheduling more devices will reduce the convergence rate.

Then given the scheduled devices, the bandwidth allocation problem is analytically solved.
Further, based on the optimal bandwidth allocation, and a derived convergence bound of FL under a stationary random scheduling policy, we approximately solve the device scheduling problem with a joint device scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm.</p>

The average number of scheduled devices with estimation errors is almost the same as that without estimation error as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-B Evaluation of the Fast Converge Scheduling Policy ‣ IV Experiment Results ‣ Joint Device Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Latency Constrained Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(b), (d), indicating that the performance loss is mostly caused by the round latency.
The main reason for the increasing round latency is that the estimation errors can cause the device scheduling algorithm (Alg. <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ III-C Device Scheduling Algorithm ‣ III Joint Device Scheduling and Bandwidth Allocation ‣ Joint Device Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Latency Constrained Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) to schedule inappropriate devices.
Nevertheless, Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-B Evaluation of the Fast Converge Scheduling Policy ‣ IV Experiment Results ‣ Joint Device Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Latency Constrained Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(a), (c) show that the proposed policy is robust to estimation errors.</p>

The result of centralized training can be treated as the upper bound of performance, where the central trainer is assumed to have 20 times stronger computation capability compared to the devices and all training data have been aggregated to the central trainer.
We notice that for the baseline policies, scheduling either too few or too many devices degrades the model accuracy for <math id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="l=1" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">l</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑙</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">l=1</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="l=2" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">l</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑙</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">l=2</annotation></semantics></math> on MNIST and all three cases on CIFAR-10.
The reason is the trade-off between the latency per round and the number of the rounds, that is: scheduling more devices can potentially reduce the number of required rounds to attain a fixed accuracy but with larger latency per round, while scheduling fewer devices can reduce the latency per round but with slower convergence rate w.r.t. the number of rounds.
For FC, since the number of scheduled devices can be optimized, there is only one point for each dataset in the figure which actually corresponds to the average number of scheduled devices.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Comparison of Different Scheduling Policies ‣ IV Experiment Results ‣ Joint Device Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Latency Constrained Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, FC performs close to the optimal points for all data distributions, because the proposed FC achieves a good trade-off between the latency per round and the number of rounds.
Moreover, the optimal number of scheduled devices increases with the non-i.i.d. level, indicating that a fixed scheduling policy cannot adapt to all different distributions of the datasets.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied a joint bandwidth allocation and scheduling problem to optimize the convergence rate of FL w.r.t. time.
We derive a convergence bound of FL to characterize the impact of device scheduling, based on which a joint bandwidth allocation and scheduling policy has been proposed.
The proposed FC policy achieves a desirable trade-off between the latency per round and the number of required rounds, in order to minimize the global loss function of the obtained model parameter under a given training time budget.
The experiments reveal that the optimal number of scheduled devices increases with the non-i.i.d. level of local datasets.
In addition, the proposed FC policy can schedule near-optimal number of devices according to the learned loss function characteristics, gradient characteristics and system dynamics, and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline scheduling policies under different data distributions and cell radius.
In the future, FL systems with heterogenous device computation capabilities and resource constraints can be considered, where joint optimization of the batch size, the number of local updates, and the device scheduling policy can be studied.</p>

If any device has finished the whole local model update process earlier than other devices,
we can reallocate some bandwidth from that device to other slower devices.
As a result, the round latency, which is determined by the slowest device, can be reduced.
The reallocation of bandwidth can be performed until all devices finish local updating at the same time.
Therefore, the optimal solution of <a href="#S3.Ex7" title="In III Joint Device Scheduling and Bandwidth Allocation ‣ Joint Device Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Latency Constrained Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">P2</span></a> can be achieved if and only if all bandwidth is allocated and all scheduled devices have the same finishing time.
As a result, the optimal solution and corresponding objective value is given by the following equations</p>
