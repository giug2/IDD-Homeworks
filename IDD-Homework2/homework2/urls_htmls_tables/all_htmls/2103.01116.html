<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">The rapid increase of the data scale in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) system paradigm, hews out new possibilities in boosting the service quality for the emerging applications through data sharing. Nevertheless, privacy concerns are major bottlenecks for data providers to share private data in traditional IoV networks. To this end, federated learning (FL) as an emerging learning paradigm, where data providers only send local model updates trained on their local raw data rather than upload any raw data, has been recently proposed to build a privacy-preserving data sharing models. Unfortunately, by analyzing on the differences of uploaded local model updates from data providers, private information can still be divulged, and performance of the system cannot be guaranteed when partial federated nodes executes malicious behavior. Additionally, traditional cloud-based FL poses challenges to the communication overhead with the rapid increase of terminal equipment in IoV system. All these issues inspire us to propose an autonomous blockchain empowered privacy-preserving FL framework in this paper, where the mobile edge computing (MEC) technology was naturally integrated in IoV system. Specifically, we introduce differential privacy techniques to prevent privacy concerns while the honesty of participants are ensured by a malicious updates remove algorithm based on self-reliability filter. Simultaneously, a double aggregation frame is proposed, to guarantee the communication overhead and ensure the quality of model training. We propose to build a federated learning participant management system by employing a blockchain architecture, and ensure the immutability of uploaded model via computing and recording their quality in blockchain. The model quality is quantified as aggregate weight and used as a criterion for the distribution of federal profits, thus attracting vehicles with high-quality data to join federated learning. Numerical results derived from real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed FL scheme for IoV system achieves good accuracy, high robustness, and enhanced security.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Next-generation Internet of Vehicles (IoV) system where the amount of data generated by the connected vehicles grows at a terrifying rate, can guarantee ultra-high reliable connectivity as well as low-delay response anytime, anywhere and on-the-move <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> foreseeingly through data sharing. Traditional cloud-centric sharing approachs request data collected from connected vehicles, e.g., measurements, videos, photos, etc., to be uploaded and processed centrally by a cloud-based server within which the processed data are futher aggregated. It can provide insights or produce effective inference models for solving the actual problems potentially emerging in IoV system, e.g., driver state analysis, road condition analysis, etc. Nevertheless, along with the benefits the data brings, some serious issues comes when demands data sharing, i.e., trading data and exchangeing knowledge between vehicles. Firstly, privacy concerns arising within the storage, transmission and sharing of private data, may touch off serious risks for data providers due to the leakage of sensitive information.
Secondly, traditional cloud-centric sharing approach involving long propagation delays thus incuring unacceptable latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, is unfriendly with some applications in which real-time decisions have to be made, e.g., autonomous vehicles. Additionally, transferring data to the cloud not only burdens the backbone networks, but also leads to large computation and storage overhead, especially in tasks involving unstructured data, e.g., in video analytics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Such malfunction mostly brings an inaccurate model, increases the response delay and engenders distortion over model training. Therefore, it is essential for the IoV system to solve these serious concerns, via designing an efficient data-sharing mechanism.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the concept of federated learning (FL), as a promising approach to address the constraints in privacy, delay and computing or storage resource, by limiting the data scale transferred and accelerating learning processes within vehicles, has been proposed by google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and drawn increasing attention. Rather than upload and process private data in a traditional centralized way, vehicles can simply send local model updates trained using local private data to a data center without uploading any raw data, thus decoupling the machine learning from acquiring, storing and training data in a central server. Massive decentralized data collected by vehicles can be trained individually and complementary knowledge can be accomplished among distributed model trainers. However, for designing a efficient and accurate IoV system, traditional FL is can not be applied straightforwardly due to following fundamental shortcomings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>:</p>

For instance, dishonest participants may replace the updating model with its exquisitely designed attack model to poison the collaborative model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, thus either preventing the global model from converging or leading to a sub-optimal minimum. Most stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based FL algorithms where the centralized aggregator averages the local updates to obtain the global update, are vulnerable to these malicious threats even attackers account for only a small proportion. The lack of protection severely injures the confidence of FL participants and prevents FL system from being used in many sensitive applications, e.g., home monitoring and self-driving cars.</p>

However, existing cloud-based aggregation approach is so sluggish that communication overhead issue may be inevitably arised with the rapid increase of terminal vehicles in IoV system. Even though the latency can be guaranteed through sinking the cloud to the edge node <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the finite number of vehicles each edge server can access, leading to the loss of training performance unavoidably.</p>

However, it is not practical in the real world due to resource costs emerged during model training. For example, vehicles with high-quality data may be reluctant to participate in FL training with other vehicles with low-quality samples, because they get the same benefits from FL tasks if without a incentive mechanism that maps the contributed resources into appropriate rewards.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain is an emerging technology as a decentralized, immutable, sharing and time-ordered ledger, which is maintained by all the nodes in a peer-to-peer network, i.e. blockchain network. Typically, blockchains can be classified into two categories: permissionless blockchain and permissioned blockchain. With permissionless blockchains, such as Bitcoin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and Ethereum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, participants are allowed to join and leave at anytime and the number of participants is not pre-defined nor fixed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Permissioned blockchains (a.k.a. consortium blockchains), e.g., IBM’s Hyperledger Fabric <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, allows only the authorized entities to join and leave the network, participate in the consensus process, send transactions, and maintain the shared ledger.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Transactions that contain timestamps and references (i.e., the hash of previous block) are stored in blocks, resulting an ordered list of blocks. For instance, transactions in Bitcoin referring to money transfers, are created by pseudonymous participants and stored to build a new block competitively by an entity called consensus node. A consensus mechanism, such as proof of work (PoW)-based, proof of stake (PoS)-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, is executed by consensus node to compete for the power to write self-organized blocks into the blockchain.</p>

Intuitively, the incremental characteristic of FL in IoV system makes it suitable for leveraging blockchain to ensure data integrity, encourage vehicles to share data and enable transparent training management. However, it is quite essential to design a reasonable approach for integrating blockchain with privacy-preserving federated learning,.</p>

Nevertheless, extremely sensitive latency requirements have demanded an alternate approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Additionly, the network architecture is becoming increasingly heterogeneous due to the complex traffic distributions in wireless communications systems. To this end, MEC is naturally proposed as a novel distributed computation architecture, that deploys application servers at the edge of wireless networks closing to where data is produced, to bring powerful capabilities in real-time data storaging and processing at the edge of network. It can be seen as a footing stone that naturally bridge the cloud-based learning services and mobile devices. MEC is specially significant for accelerating the rapid download of various applications and allowing users to enjoy an uninterrupted high-quality network experience, due to the characteristics in ultra-high bandwidth, ultra-low latency, and strong real-time.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a cloud-centric FL framework where long propagation delays and communication overhead issue may be inevitably arised with the rapid increase of terminal vehicles in IoV system, puts forward a new demand for the development of FL architecture in the IoV system. On the other hand, the limited storage and computing resources of the terminal vehicles make it insufficient as the main blockchain nodes, which need to validate all transactions generated in FL training and implement complex consensus mechanisms to competing for writing blocks. These requirements in FL framework which consistent with the definition and characteristics of MEC, naturally inspire us to integrate MEC into federated learning to obtain a low-overhead and efficient FL framework. Nevertheless, compared with cloud-centric FL framework, the limited number of clients each MEC server can access, leads to inevitable training performance loss. Therefore, the trade between communication overhead and system performance should be made appropriately.</p>

In this framework, we introduce the blockchain technique to store the information of each device, select trainers automatically, and ensure the transparency and traceability of federated training process and final profit distribution. The local differential privacy technique is applied to curtail the inference attacks while the honesty of participants are ensured by a malicious updates remove algorithm based on self-reliability filter to effectively avoid the influence of false gradients provided by dishonest trainers. Simultaneously, the MEC technology is introduced to sink the aggregation center from cloud to the MEC server, to minimize the cloud communication overhead as much as possible. Furthermore, we propose an double aggregation frame, where a cloud server is deployed to re-aggregate updates generated via aggregating local model updates in massive edge servers.</p>

Through a malicious update remove algorithm based on self-reliability filter, which aims to effectively defense against malicious attacks, each MEC server selects the most suitable updates which can potentially bring the greatest benefits to the globe model to produce preliminary aggregation model by adopting an attack-resistant aggregation model based on repeated median estimator and the reweighting scheme. The generated preliminary aggregation models are subsequently delivered to the cloud server to re-aggregate. The re-aggregated model is used as the initial global model for the next iteration. Each model of trainers with corresponding quality will be written into the block by consensus nodes in the form of verification transactions for following audit. All transactions arising in this aggregation interval will be packaged and verified through a blockchain network, where a consensus mechanism based on the reliability of preliminary aggregation model of each consensus node in collaborative training, is executed to select a leader. Then, the leader broadcasts its self-organized block into the entire blockchain and write into the blockchain after verifying by all blockchain nodes. Once FL task is finished, the profit of this model, which is usually provided by the task publisher when initiating the model request, is partitioned to all trainers according to each trainer’s contribution. In this paper, we propose a unique contribution quantification method, where the trainer’s contribution is quantified as aggregate weight during training process.</p>

Therefore, adversaries can hardly recover the original model parameters and detect a slight change in the dataset by observing the output models, even if gainning access to the noise-adding gradient information, so as to achieve the purpose of protecting privacy in FL framework. In fact, another potential reason for introducing differential privacy into the training process is that DP training may limit the efficacy of a backdoor attrack by setting a low clipping bounds and high noise variance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Because the attack increases the distance of the backdoored model to the global model, it is more sensitive to clipping than to noise addition.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning which is promising to be applied to construct a collaborative model without exposing users’ private data, is substantially different
from traditional centralized learning. This peculiarity determines federated learning to be utilized to coordinate thousands or millions of devices in the future IoV system to complete cooperative modeling, without restrictions on eligibility on heterogeneous data scale. Nevertheless, participants’ behavior in FL training cannot be monitored unlike centralized way, leading that we can not exclude malicious participants by relying solely on the devices’ autologous security guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> when training with thousands of participants. The participants performing maliciously and engenderring unreliable updates may be caused by: 1) sensing data from malicious intent or tampered devices may include deceptive information, which is similar to false data injection attacks in smart grids <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>; 2) the data can be arbitrarily manipulated when being transmitted through insecure communication channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Previous FL aggregation works assume one cloud server based aggregator, where millions of participated devices, e.g., vehicles in the IoV system, directly upload local updates for aggregation. However, a cloud-based aggregation approach is so sluggish that communication overhead issue may be inevitably arised with the rapid increase of terminal vehicles in IoV system. With the recent emergence of edge computing platforms, researchers have started investigating edge-based FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. For edge-based FL, the proximate edge server, such as a base station, will act as the parameter server, while the clients within its communication range of the server collaborate to train a learning model, thus the latency of the computation is comparable to that of communication to the edge parameter server. Nevertheless, the finite number of vehicles each edge server can access, leading to the loss of training performance unavoidably.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS4.p2.8" class="ltx_p">From the above comparison, we see a necessity in leveraging a cloud server to cover the massive aggregation update, while each edge server enjoys quick model updates with its local trainers. This motivates us to propose a MEC-based double aggregation frame as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Blockchain-Based Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Networks with Application in Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, where each MEC server first aggregates the filtered normal nodes surviving in malicious updates fifter based on self-reliability, to produce preliminary aggregation model, which is subsequently delivered to the cloud server to re-aggregate with the preliminary aggregation results of the remaining MEC servers.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.5" class="ltx_p">The consensus process is executed by all consensus nodes to competes for the qualification to write self-organized blocks to the blockchain via a consensus protocol. The node who wins the competition will be treated as a leader to broadcasts its local block to other nodes for verification. Once the verification is passed, the block is added to the permissioned blockchain which is tamper-proof. Traditional consensus protocol, e.g., PoW-based, not only brings high compution cost and communication overhead, but makes limited additional contribution to FL, thus making it less practical for the FL-based IoV system to adopt. To address this issue, we further propose a new consensus, which bases on accuracy performance of each consensus node in testing dataset, to improve the utility and efficiency of computing work in the consensus protocol. More specifically, in each iteration, once each consensus node aggregates the local updates responsible for to generate a preliminary aggregation model, we respectively predicts the testing dataset using aggregation model of all consensus nodes, and finally the consensus node with the highest testing dataset consensus accuracy will be selected as the leader.

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the current federated learning paradigm, most existing works assume optimistically that all the vehicles in IoV system will participate in FL tasks unconditionally when were invited. However, it is not practical in the real world due to resource costs emerged during model training. Thus, it is vital to bring in some incentive mechanism that maps the contributed resources into appropriate rewards.
In this paper, we address the problem of treating FL participants fairly based on their contributions, which can be quantified by aggregation weight as shown in equation (<a href="#S4.E22" title="In 4.3.3 Attack-resistant Aggregation Algorithm ‣ 4.3 Attack Mitigation and Double aggregation ‣ 4 Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Mobile Edge Computing ‣ Blockchain-Based Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Networks with Application in Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">22</span></a>), to build a healthy FL incentive mechanism.</p>

The results show that our approach outperforms FedAvg and reweighting aggregation algorithm in defending the sign-flipping attack and same-value Attack when the proportion of malicious attackers is gradually increasing. More specifically, due to involve model information of all malicious attackers in model aggregation, FedAvg fails to converge and has relatively low accuracy under both sign-flipping and same-value attack.

The reason can be summarized as, reweighting aggregation algorithm which calculates the confidence of updates based on the residual to a joint repeated median of all gradients, thus resulting in the linear regression line will be determined by the malicious models when the proportion of malicious attackers exceeds a certain ratio. In this case, most of the malicious updates will be aggregated, which will cause the global model to face convergence failure. Notice that same-value attack greatly amplifies the model parameters, leading the global model deviates further from the normal update trajectory. Thence, same-value attack may cause more significant damage on the model performance than sign-flipping attack.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">For pixel-pattern backdoor attacks in federated learning, attackers manipulate their local models so that the learned global model predicts some backdoor target label for any image embedded with certain patterns. The global model can behave normally for clean data. We choose “2” in MNIST as the backdoor target labels. The training data is mixed with manipulated data and clean data to fit both the backdoor task and the main task. Morever, an attacker poisons its local model and submits the malicious update in every round.

Obviously, our method achieves the lowest in terms of attack success rate on MNIST under both backdoor attack scenarios. Intuitively, backdoor attacks can easily succeed under FedAvg due to absorb all of local updates with backdoor attacks and another baseline, i.e., reweighting aggregation algorithm, only works when there are a small number of attackers. When the proportion of attackers increases, reweighting aggregation algorithm can only slow down the process but still reach high attack success

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we addressed data sharing issues related to ensuring secure, effective robust IoV system, by integrating blockchain, differential privacy, and MEC technology to federated learning framework. Specifically, local differential privacy techniques is introduced to prevent privacy concerns while the auditability of update models are ensured by based on self-reliability filter. In addition, a blockchain architecture is employed to build a federated learning participant management system and ensure the immutability of uploaded model, whose quality quantified as aggregate weight is used as a criterion for the distribution of federal mission profits. Simultaneously, an double aggregation frame based on mobile edge computing is proposed to effectively reduce cloud communication overhead and ensure the quality of model training. The results of analyses and experiments demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme achieves good accuracy, high robustness, and enhanced security.
