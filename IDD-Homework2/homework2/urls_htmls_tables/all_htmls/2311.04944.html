<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT), deploying deep learning models to process data generated or collected by IoT devices is a critical challenge. However, direct data transmission can cause network congestion and inefficient execution, given that IoT devices typically lack computation and communication capabilities. Centralized data processing in data centers is also no longer feasible due to concerns over data privacy and security. To address these challenges, we present an innovative Edge-assisted U-Shaped Split Federated Learning (EUSFL) framework, which harnesses the high-performance capabilities of edge servers to assist IoT devices in model training and optimization process. In this framework, we leverage Federated Learning (FL) to enable data holders to collaboratively train models without sharing their data, thereby enhancing data privacy protection by transmitting only model parameters. Additionally, inspired by Split Learning (SL), we split the neural network into three parts using U-shaped splitting for local training on IoT devices. By exploiting the greater computation capability of edge servers, our framework effectively reduces overall training time and allows IoT devices with varying capabilities to perform training tasks efficiently. Furthermore, we proposed a novel noise mechanism called LabelDP to ensure that data features and labels can securely resist reconstruction attacks, eliminating the risk of privacy leakage. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that EUSFL can be integrated with various aggregation algorithms, maintaining good performance across different computing capabilities of IoT devices, and significantly reducing training time and local computation overhead.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fast-paced growth and widespread adoption of IoT have resulted in the increased usage of IoT devices in various scenarios<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. For instance, sensor devices are commonly deployed in intelligent detection systems, and IoT devices, together with technologies like deep learning and artificial intelligence, are used in joint applications. Meanwhile, IoT devices are widely distributed, providing an extensive source of data support for AI. According to Ericsson’s prediction, the total amount of internet data will reach 40ZB in 2024, with IoT devices contributing 45% of the total data generated. As the amount of data generated by IoT continues to rise, the conventional approach of centralizing data is no longer feasible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Transmitting data can lead to difficulties such as network congestion and excessive transmission. Additionally, unauthorized data manipulation can result in legal issues due to the constraints of data privacy protection regulations like GDPR<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate new technical solutions that incorporate privacy protection features suitable for the IoT environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the rising concern on privacy, Federated Learning (FL), which is a distributed machine learning architecture with data privacy protection feature, is considered as a promising solution for IoT scenarios to extract the potential of data produced by IoT devices without the risk of privacy leakage<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Unlike traditional distributed machine learning, FL only requires the participants to upload the trained local model update to perform aggregation to obtain a global model that can be used for sharing without any transfer of raw data, eliminating the risk of privacy leakage when data holders distribute or transmit data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Thus, within the IoT environments, the raw data is utilized by IoT devices for local model training, after which only the local model parameters are uploaded for global model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As AI-related research progresses, the scale of machine learning and deep learning models continues to expand. Through the analysis of current computational requirements for SOTA models, it has been found that the model parameters can reach up to 732M, 727M, and 23.8B in different fields such as speech recognition, image classification, and natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. While deploying these functions in IoT environment, it is clear that models on IoT devices requires higher computational capabilities. Despite the growing performance of IoT devices, they still face challenges when dealing with such immense and rapidly increasing computational complexities and may have an impact on other tasks on the device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. More new approaches need to be explored to enable IoT devices, which are relatively weak in computational capability, to effectively deploy models to perform training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Split learning (SL) is a powerful technique that enables the distributed training of neural network models by allowing different layers to be allocated to different entities for training and inference purposes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Common approach involves layer-based model splitting between client and server, whereby model training is divided into two parts. The first part is performed on the client, with the second part executed on the server. SL can effectively alleviate the computational burden on IoT devices, thereby facilitating model training on resource-constrained devices, and also providing decent privacy guarantee.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Given the advantages of both FL and SL in deep learning model training, it is a logical step to combine these techniques to improve the efficiency of IoT devices in the training process. By integrating FL and SL, it is possible to leverage the data privacy-preserving properties of FL with the model privacy properties of SL, thereby ensuring privacy for both data and models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The main approach is to split an intact neural network model into multiple parts based on layers, to have the computationally demanding parts of the split model done on the server side with more computational power, and for IoT devices to train only the low-computational parts of the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, introducing these methods into practical scenarios also brings new threats. Therefore, new security analysis and protective measures need to be considered. We need to ensure that our framework is secure against attacks. Therefore, we proposed LabelDP, a new noise mechanism, further enhance the privacy protection capabilities of our framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">According to the above description, to address the problems of data privacy and insufficient computing capability of devices in the IoT environment, this article proposes an edge-assisted U-shaped split federated learning (EUSFL) framework, which exploit edge servers in a three-tier architecture of ”Client-Edge-Central” to assist IoT devices to complete the training process of local models, improve the overall computational efficiency, reduce the computational overhead of devices, and maintain data privacy. In EUSFL framework, IoT devices can use their local data for local model training, and U-shaped split learning method make it applicable to the IoT environment
to make full use of the computing resources of the edge servers and devices to complete the training and inference process more efficiently. The U-shaped splitting approach involves splitting the neural network model into three parts. The middle part, which requires more computational power, is supported by the edge server, while the first and last parts are performed on the IoT devices. This approach entails the transmission of only the parameters obtained from each part of the training, ensuring that each part of the model remains inaccessible to the others and thereby improving model privacy. Hence, within the EUSFL framework, it is feasible to maintain the privacy of raw data held by the data holder, while also safeguarding the label information in model training, resulting in a privacy-preserving design with excellent computational efficiency. Additionally, this approach offers superior scalability compared to both the vanilla SL method and traditional FL methods.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of network communication technology and computing chips, IoT has begun to be widely deployed in people’s production and living, which makes a large amount of data from different user devices need to be processed by various applications. Among them, machine learning technology provides a wide range of intelligent services, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and other applications that have greatly changed our lives.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning is one of the most commonly used AI methods to implement AI applications. Its principle is to put input data into a multi-layer neural network in the form of a vector and obtain the corresponding results through its calculation. The neural network can be regarded as a distribution function for a specific problem modelling. Its training process is to minimize the loss function by adjusting its parameters so as to fit this distribution function as much as possible, making it accurately perform the task we want. However, when deploying DL to various devices, a large amount of highly dispersed IoT data makes conventional cloud-based IoT infrastructure insufficient to support the original operation of applications. An emerging paradigm edge computing is to offload computing tasks to distributed cloud-like edge devices, promising a new infrastructure platform to support high-performance IoT applications.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Considering that existing applications have high computing requirements, although the performance of current end devices is gradually improving, it is still hard to meet the requirement for deep learning model training. Edge computing can be seen as an extension of cloud computing, which devolves computing, storage and other operations to edge nodes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is distributed machine learning technique that allows multiple devices, such as smartphones or edge devices train their models without sharing data. FL has greatly applied to various situations such as text and emoji prediction on smartphone keyboard<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, medical imaging<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, recommendation system<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, nature language processing<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and so on. This is implemented by having devices train their local models using their data, then sending model updates to the aggregator. The aggregator aggregates the updates and produces the updated global model. The popularity of federated learning keep growing in recent years due to its characteristic to protect user privacy, reduce data transfer, and support larger-scale training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, combining FL with IoT has become a hot research topic. The initial idea was to utilize the characteristics of federated learning to protect the data privacy of IoT users or devices. Haya et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a deep federated learning framework that uses IoT devices for healthcare data monitoring and analysis. Saurabh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed an IoT medical data privacy protection framework that utilizes both federated learning and blockchain technology. As a new form of machine learning, FL also provides a new direction for IoT security issues. Thien et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed a federated self-learning anomaly detection and prevention system that can detect and prevent unknown attacks in the IoT. Viraaji et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed an anomaly detection method based on FL that uses decentralized device data in IoT networks to proactively identify intrusion attacks. In addition, FL also provides a new data-sharing mode for IoT environments, breaking down the data barriers of traditional IoT models. Lu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> designed a secure data-sharing architecture for industrial IoT using blockchain technology and federated learning. FL has also been used for resource allocation in IoT environments. Nguyen et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed a resource allocation problem that minimizes total energy consumption and FL completion time in wireless IoT networks using the FL algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The combination of FL and edge intelligence can achieve real-time and decentralized machine learning at the edges, which is particularly useful for applications such as predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and personalized recommendation systems<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. However, applying FL to mobile edge networks faces many challenges, including data and system heterogeneity, communication overhead, limited resources, system reliability, scalability, and privacy and security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Compared with common computing devices, the computing capability of IoT devices is usually weaker, which may cause the problem of straggling, affect the overall training time and the final model performance. Moreover, when edge devices train DL model locally, its high computation consumption may negatively affect the original task<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For limited resources, existing research mainly considers reducing resource consumption by reducing data transmission. There are two major ideas to reduce transmission: (1) reduce the frequency of communication between clients and server (2) reduce the transmission between each client and server. For example, CMFL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> reduces the overhead of data transfer by setting a threshold to reduce the upload of useless updates. In another method, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> reuses outdated local parameters to schedule clients and theoretically analyzed its communication characteristics and convergence. Although such methods can reduce communication overhead, FL cannot alleviate computational overhead.</p>

However, on the other hand, SL also increases the communication consumption between devices. How to reduce the communication consumption of this process has become another research direction. Chen et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposed an asynchronous training scheme to reduce communication consumption by reducing the update frequency of the client model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, as two different distributed machine learning methods, some studies have compared the two, or combined the two. Wu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and Gao et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> discussed the parallelism and resource management about SL, shows that the two have their own advantages and disadvantages in computing consumption and communication consumption. Thapa et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed a new novel framework, combining FL and SL, used for model traning on distributed sequential data. Liu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> applied such hybrid learning method to UAV cluster, greatly reduced computation overhead at end device. However, the author in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> pointed out that the above training method is more effective for vertical federated learning where data and labels are dispersed. In the case of horizontal federated learning, spreading labels will cause privacy leakage.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy (DP) is a fundamental concept in the field of privacy-preserving data analysis. It provides a rigorous framework for quantifying and ensuring the privacy of individuals in datasets used for statistical analysis and machine learning. Introduced by Dwork et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, differential privacy has become a cornerstone in the design of privacy-preserving algorithms and has gained significant attention from both academia and industry.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">DP guarantees that the presence or absence of a single individual’s data point does not significantly affect the outcome or result of any analysis. In other words, it ensures that the inclusion or exclusion of any individual’s data does not lead to distinguishable changes in the output of queries or computations performed on the dataset. This property is achieved by adding carefully calibrated noise to the query results or the data itself, making it difficult to infer sensitive information about any individual, even if an adversary has auxiliary knowledge about the other data in the dataset.</p>

For conventional distributed learning, the Client uploads all the data to a training center. Such method may cause privacy leakage and congestion, but the Client doesn’t do any extra calculations. FL may bring calculation overhead because of the local computation on model training. Split learning can eliminate computation overhead to a certain extent, but conveying labels may also give rise to privacy problems. These methods have merits and drawbacks, combining these methods can eliminate the learning problem in the IoT environment.</p>

With stronger computing performance of the Edge server, Edge server can do its corresponding forward propagation with the second part model (middle part) quickly. Edge server uses smashed data to calculate the next smashed data and then sends it back to Client. Client uses the third part of the local model to calculate the prediction result, as well as loss value and gradient. Client Updates local parameters of the third part using gradient, and sends it back to the Edge server. The Edge server updates the parameters of the Edge server’s middle model according to the result of the gradient and then sends it back to Client.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the communication overhead brought by EUSFL, the time consumption may not be shorter than EFL. For example, in a scenario with low communication performance, Clients will spend much time waiting for the transmission of smashed data during the training process. Based on this condition, we make a detailed analysis of the efficiency of EUSFL.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">If skipping the Edge server, the Client will directly connect to Central server. In this case, the transmission rate will be deficient, and it may cause connection interruption. In this way of connection, the most basic training method is FL - all clients directly connect to the Central server, and each client independently uses local data for training, only uploading model updates. The second basic training method is SL - all clients place the shallow part of the neural network locally for data input and initial forward propagation and send smashed data to the Central server in each training epoch. After the Central server completes the loss function calculation, it sends the gradient of smashed data back to Client for backward propagation.</p>

In this split method, Edge server will replace the Central server that is not applicable in the non-Edge method, and aggregation will be performed independently at both the Edge server and Central server.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p17.1" class="ltx_p">The result of the above equation shows the time gap between FL and USFL in single epoch training, when the inequality is satisfied, USFL will be more efficient than FL. The larger the result is, the more efficient the USFL method will be. Adjusting the parameters of the above equation to make the result as large as possible will make USFL more efficient. This problem can be regarded as an multi-objective optimization problem, but the adjustment of the parameters may affect the accuracy of the training results, we will continue the this direction in our future work.

In ideal circumstance, while all of the raw data is held by client, the privacy of these data is guaranteed. However, some researchers have found that exploiting alternative data could usurp privacy data. Besides, our method extends FL to more complex scenario, the privacy preservation capabilities should be discussed more meticulously.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are several attacks could be used to recover raw data. DLG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and iDLG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> is proposed to recover raw data and label, by optimizing the gradient difference between dummy data and ground truth. Although recovering data in such simple approach sounds sensational, there still exists convergence problem in deep models. Consider iDLG has better performace than DLG, we use iDLG to recover data. Fig.<a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2.3 Privacy Preservation Against HBC adversary ‣ 5.2 Privacy Analysis ‣ 5 Efficiency Analysis ‣ Edge-assisted U-Shaped Split Federated Learning with Privacy-preserving for Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the result of iDLG implemented on Edge server side. The y-axis of this figure represents reconstruction loss, and lower loss indicates more accurate reconstruction. The yellow dots represent the original model (LeNet) implemented by the authors of iDLG, and blue dots represent our simplest model (CNN) in our experiment, which has more than about 10x parameters than LeNet. It can be observed that when the model becomes more complex, the reconstruction loss couldn’t reach a visible extent.</p>

The left y-axis represents training accuracy after 10 epochs, and the right y-axis represents attack success rate (ASR).

This threshold effectively resists label reconstruction attacks without accuracy deterioration.</p>

However, the extensive preliminary process is too complex to conduct in an IoT environment. In this case, our framework can remain secure against such attacks.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we discuss the feasibility, and scalability of the EUSFL framework, and illustrate three key factors that affect training efficiency, including Client’s computational performance, the Client’s transfer rate to Edge server, and Edge server’s computational performance. Finally, there are two practical simulations to show our scheme can greatly shorten the process of training.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Before discussing training efficiency, we conduct some experiments to verify there is no effect of EUSFL on training accuracy. In this part, the ESFL and EUSFL methods are combined and applied with five different FL algorithms, which compare the accuracy with different datasets and neural network models with epoch settings of 10, 20, and 30, respectively. As shown in Table<a href="#S6.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 6.2.1 Accuracy and Scalability ‣ 6.2 Result and Analysis ‣ 6 Experiment ‣ Edge-assisted U-Shaped Split Federated Learning with Privacy-preserving for Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, in some scenarios, EUSFL has better accuracy than the original FL methods without the EUSFL framework. As an example, in the epoch of 10, MNIST dataset experiments, EUSFL when combined with FedProx, Scaffold, FedNova, and FedDC all have better accuracy than those without the EUSFL framework. Similarly, the performance is almost similar in CIFAR-10 datasets with other epoch settings.</p>

It can be observed that there is little difference in accuracy between the different methods after training, as the overall training process of both standard SL and U-shaped SL is mathematically equivalent to that of FL. However, U-shaped SL offers better privacy and does not involve the transmission of label information during the training process, thus enhancing its privacy-preserving capability.</p>

In this condition, FL spent the longest time finishing the training task because of the heavy computational burden. Both the computation and communication requirements of Client are the least, so the time consumption of SFL is the shortest. Compared with SFL, USFL needs more data to be transferred due to a U-shaped split, and since the model of VGG-16 is very large, The time consumption also gets longer because ESFL needs an extra aggregation between the Edge server and the Central server. From the result, we can get to know, under such computation-limited and privacy-preserving conditions, using EUSFL can greatly shorten training time.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the privacy and efficiency issues in training deep learning models in IoT environments, an efficient Edge-Assisted U-Split Federated Learning framework with privacy-preserving, EUSFL, is proposed to facilitate the efficient and collaborative training. EUSFL ingeniously apply unique U-Split method with the federated learning distributed architecture with additional LabelDP, our framework resisted data reconstruction attacks while ensuring data security. The U-shaped splitting method eliminates the need for any label information transmission during the training process, thus greatly reducing the threat of privacy leakage. LabelDP is also proposed to resist label reconstruction attack. The effectiveness of the EUSFL framework is verified through extensive experiments in simulation settings, and the performance is evaluated and analyzed in detail. When the communication conditions are favorable, EUSFL can effectively reduce the computational expenditure of devices, which in turn improves the efficiency of the whole system. Therefore, EUSFL is a promising solution in resource-constrained IoT environments, with good performance and scalability for different IoT scenarios.</p>
