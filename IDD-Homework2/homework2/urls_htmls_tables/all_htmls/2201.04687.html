<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Entity Matching is an essential part of all real-world systems that take in structured and unstructured data coming from different sources. Typically no common key is available for connecting records. Massive data cleaning and integration processes require completion before any data analytics, or further processing can be performed. Although record linkage is frequently regarded as a somewhat tedious but necessary step, it reveals valuable insights, supports data visualization, and guides further analytic approaches to the data. Here, we focus on organization entity matching. We introduce CompanyName2Vec, a novel algorithm to solve company entity matching (CEM) using a neural network model to learn company name semantics from a job ad corpus, without relying on any information on the matched company besides its name. Based on a real-world data, we show that CompanyName2Vec outperforms other evaluated methods and solves the CEM challenge with an average success rate of 89.3%.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Enterprise Business intelligence systems have emerged as a disruptive technology and innovative solution to the global economy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Business intelligence became an emerging and fast-growing field in the past years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Big data and its emerging technologies, including business intelligence and big data analytics systems, have become a mainstream market adopted broadly across industries, organizations, and geographic regions to facilitate data-driven decision making and significantly affect the way that decision-makers, such as CEOs, operate and run their business <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. One of the fundamental functionalities a business intelligence system must have is the ability to integrate many data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The integration of multiple sources usually requires linking between the significant entities that exist across data sources and systems. Usually, those entities function as a “primary key” in each system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The technique used for performing such linkage is commonly referred to as “Record Linkage,” “Data Deduplication,” “Object Matching,” or “Entity Matching” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Entity Matching (EM) is a fundamental task in data integration scenarios. EM is the task to identify semantically equivalent entities referring to the same real-world object (e.g., persons, products, companies) within one data source or between different sources. EM is also a core technique for data cleaning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and data integration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Accurate and fast entity matching has huge practical implications in a wide variety of commercial, scientific and security domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. EM solutions can be divided into three separate groups: supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Supervised approaches require labeled training sets or predefined thresholds on which to base their decisions. Unfortunately, in most real-world cases, the variety of patterns that can be observed are not feasible to be captured in a training set. Therefore, these solutions are quite limited. Unsupervised approaches help find previously unknown patterns in a dataset without pre-existing labels and are based on clustering algorithms that group together items with high similarity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Semi-supervised approaches fall between the unsupervised approach (with no labeled training data) and a supervised approach (with only labeled training data). Semi-supervised approaches are based on a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Many enterprise business intelligence applications require the integration of multiple data sources. In such applications, a company name is one of the most crucial entity attributes to be linked <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. A company usually exists in many of the enterprise systems. For example, a company can represent a potential customer, a sales lead in the sales system, an existing customer in the customer relationship management system, a supplier in the logistics system, etc. Although a company name can be noisy, in most cases, this is one of the most potent properties for company entity matching (CEM) due to the lack of unique shared identifiers across datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Determine whether a new company name is in a database, and if so, which existing record it refers to is a typical problem business intelligence applications need to solve given records indexed by company names and a new company name.
This problem is an instance of entity matching problem. It is a challenging problem because people do not consistently use the official name, but use abbreviations, synonyms, different order of terms, different spelling of terms, short form of terms, and the name can contain typos or spacing issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Many of the existing methods use more company properties other than the company name, such as location, primary phone number, industry, website URL, and more to improve CEM results. Such company information is usually costly to acquire on a large scale. The largest public source for such company information is DBpedia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. DBpedia contains about 65,000 company entities worldwide, derived from the English version of Wikipedia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. There are several companies worldwide that hold a much larger dataset of company information, such as Dun and Bradstreet and Infogroup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. These companies do not provide the complete dataset but provide a limited paid service for company information enrichment, mainly for sales and marketing purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we developed CompanyName2Vec (see Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Method ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>), a novel algorithm to solve CEM using a neural network model to learn company name semantics from a job ad corpus. Once trained, such a model can suggest synonymous company names. As the name implies, CompanyName2Vec represents each different company name as a vector. The vectors are chosen carefully such that a simple mathematical function, like cosine similarity between vectors, indicates the level of semantic similarity between the company names represented by those vectors.
We used CompanyName2Vec for CEM. For this purpose, we created a real-world dataset that consists of the largest companies in the US and their synonyms. We used this dataset to evaluate the CompanyName2Vec algorithm and compared it with other known entity matching methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To develop the CompanyName2Vec algorithm, we needed a relatively large corpus of company names. Job ads consisting of company names that are available publicly on a large scale but are very noisy (see Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Hiring Company Names Fingerprinting ‣ 3 Method ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>) due to how job ad distribution works. Companies distribute their jobs to multiple job boards and sometimes to recruitment and staffing agencies to reach as many job seekers as possible. In many cases, the process for posting a job ad on job boards requires the employer to manually type the job information, including company name, location, title, description, and more, which causes some inconsistency and duplication of job ads. For example, Tesla’s job ad can be posted with several employer names like tesla; Tesla, Inc.; Tesla Motors; Tesla Motors, Inc.; and Ursus, which is a staffing and recruitment agency.
CompanyName2Vec leverages the availability of job ads publicly (see Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Dataset ‣ 4 Experimental Study ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>) and their inconsistency to learn company name semantics (see Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Company Name Embedding ‣ 3 Method ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The method developed consists of the following steps (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>): First, we collected a large dataset of job ads (see Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Dataset ‣ 4 Experimental Study ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>). Second, we used a fingerprinting technique and created a list of company names that posted the same job (see Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Hiring Company Names Fingerprinting ‣ 3 Method ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>). Additionally, we cleaned the data to filter out non-valid job ads and company names to create a ground truth dataset.
Next, we pre-processed this cleaned dataset and created train and test sets (see Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Company Name Embedding ‣ 3 Method ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>).
Afterward, we trained a neural network model to learn company names semantics and transform company names into a vector representation and used cosine distance for measuring the similarity between different vectors, where two company names that represent the same company will have similar vectors (see Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Company Name Embedding ‣ 3 Method ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>). For example, employers write their company name in many ways, sometimes ignoring common suffixes, like Inc., and LLC, which are used to define the company legal entity type but are less important when posting a job ad or tagging the company name in a social media post.
Lastly, we created a real-world dataset of the largest 1,000 companies in the US and their synonyms (see Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Dataset ‣ 4 Experimental Study ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>). We used this dataset to evaluate our method’s performance by measuring the success rate at <math id="S1.p8.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p8.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p8.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p8.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> of matching company synonyms with their mapped canonical company name (see Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Evaluation Process and Performance Metrics ‣ 4 Experimental Study ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The character-based similarity metrics method is designed to manage typographical errors efficiently. A popular character-based method is the Levenshtein distance (also referred to as Edit Distance) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. This method measures similarity between two strings by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other, including insertion, deletion or substitutions.

Jaro distance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> is based on the number of common characters and the number of transpositions in two strings.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p2.7" class="ltx_p">In terms of company names, Levenshtein Distance seems to work well for a single word or a much longer text, but not for just for a few words <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, as in our use case. For example, “New York Yankees” and “Yankees” are clearly referring to the same company name, but “New York Mets” and “New York Yankees” are clearly referring to different ones. Yet, the score of the “wrong” match is higher than the “right” one.
For such cases, there is a heuristic called “best partial” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, which uses partial matching logic. This logic is implemented in the Fuzzy-Wuzzy package <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, which is based on Levenshtein Distance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to calculate the differences between two different strings.

So in the case of “Yankees” and “New York Yankees” the score will be higher than the score of “New York Mets” and “New York Yankees” (see Table <a href="#S2.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 2.2.1 Character-Based Similarity Metrics ‣ 2.2 Distance Metrics ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), since the substring “Yankees” is wholly contained in the string “New York Yankees.”</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The method of Character-based similarity metrics measures similarity depending only on the appearance and sequence of characters, while token-based similarity metrics first tokenize two strings into sets of tokens (words) and only then compute the similarity between the two sets. Token-based similarity metrics are robust in measuring the similarity of full names, for example, where the order of the first name and last name may change from one string to another.
A standard method for Token-based similarity metrics is <span id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TF-IDF</span> (Term Frequency / Inverted Document Frequency) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, a numerical statistic method that intends to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.

Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two strings by measuring the angle between the vectors. Token-based similarity metrics methods do not take misspellings into account. Therefore those methods are usually used together with character-based methods to determine whether two tokens are similar enough <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Among digital data, documents are the easiest to copy and remove any signatures or fingerprints embedded, which make the pirating the hardest to detect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Anyone can retype a document or copy a part of it. Document fingerprinting is concerned with accurately identifying and copying, including small partial copies, within large sets of documents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Our study uses fingerprinting to find hiring company synonyms in the job ads dataset by calculating a job ad fingerprint and looking for hiring company names with the same fingerprint. A Checksum, for example, is a small digest of the entire document. This method is simple and sufficient for detecting exact copies. Still in some cases, as well as for our study, there is a requirement in a method that is more local and detects partial copies like the Winnowing algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which selects the q-gram whose hash value is the minimum within a sliding window of q-grams. Winnowing is used for text clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and detecting plagiarism, like the comparison Agung Toto Wibowo published in 2013 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> which detects plagiarism fraud on Bahasa Indonesia documents, or Moss by Alex Aiken <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> which is a system for measuring software similarity, used by Stanford university for detecting plagiarism in programming classes.</p>

We used text embedding, similarly to what Yoshua Bengio proposed in 2001 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, in the form of a feed-forward neural network language model. Modern methods use a simpler and more efficient neural architecture to learn word vectors, like word2vec <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, and GloVe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, based on objective functions that are explicitly designed to produce high-quality vectors.
Neural embedding learned by these methods have been applied in a myriad of NLP applications, including initializing neural network models for objective visual recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, or machine translation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, as well as directly modeling word-to-word relationships <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, Paragraph vectors, or doc2vec, were proposed in 2014 by Quoc Le and Tomas Mikolov <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> as a simple extension to word2vec to extend the learning of embedding from words to word sequences. Doc2vec<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The term doc2vec was popularized by Gensim, a widely-used implementation of paragraph vectors: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/</span></span></span> is agnostic to the granularity of the word sequence, and it can equally be a word n-gram, sentence, paragraph, or document. One of the benefits of using dense and low-dimensional vectors is computational. The main benefit of this dense representation is generalization power. If we believe some features may provide similar clues, it is worthwhile to give a representation that can capture these similarities. We used text embedding to learn company names semantics and to measure similarity.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The method described below deals with CEM by creating a generic open solution that matches company names. Unlike many other existing solutions that utilize expensive commercial datasets, the presented method’s novelty uses job-ads data, and it requires no company’s information for matching besides its name.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our method consists of two main parts: first, the creation of pairs, in which a pair consists of synonyms for the same company based on an analysis of large-scale job ads data (see Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Hiring Company Names Fingerprinting ‣ 3 Method ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>); second, the algorithm CompanyName2Vec for constructing an embedding model that utilizes these pairs of synonyms. The embedding model takes as input a company name and returns as output meaningful vector representation, where two company names that represent the same company will be relatively close vectors in terms of the Cosine distance (see Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Company Name Embedding ‣ 3 Method ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given a job ads corpus, we first create and enrich each job ad with a unique job ad identifier (aka job ad fingerprint) using a fingerprinting technique.
Second, we use the job ad fingerprint to identify company name synonyms. We group the job ad data by job ad fingerprint and create a list of company names posted with the same fingerprint, or in other words, company names that were published within the same job ad. Then, we remove duplicated synonyms and create a list of pairs, where each pair includes company names that were posted within one or more job ads.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A particular case we need to handle is staffing and recruitment agencies, which often publish their customers’ job ads anonymously and use the staffing or recruitment agency name instead.
Ideally, each pair includes company names that refer to the same company. Therefore, to reduce such noise, we filter out staffing and recruitment agencies’ names using naive text matching. Our analysis found that much of the noise can be reduced by filtering company names which include the following strings: “staff,” “recruit,” “jobs,” or “unknown.”</p>

We named this embedding solution CompanyName2Vec.
Since company names usually use minimal text, a few words, or a few dozens of characters on average, we first split the company name into characters. We used this representation for a company name instead of a word granularity level.
Then used n-gram tokenizer, where <math id="S3.SS2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p4.1.m1.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> between 1 and 3, and embedded its result using a hash function.

To increase the context available to the algorithm, we used a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), a sequence processing model that consists of two LSTMs: one takes the input in a forward direction, and the other in a backward direction.

In this study, we used a job-ads corpus from one of the biggest job boards in the United States, with more than ten million job ads. Although the dataset was acquired from a single source, there was considerable inconsistency in some jobs’ properties, such as city names. For example, Los Angeles in California, USA, can be found in many variations, mainly due to letter capitalization, punctuation, and abbreviation, such as “Los-Angeles, CA”; “la, ca”; “los angeles california,” and more. Company names are also being regulated and need to comply with the state naming rules in the states where they will be doing business. Otherwise, a state might not accept the documents filed to form or qualify the company. Naming conventions include suffixes like “LLC,” “Inc.,” “Ltd.,” etc.</p>

As can be seen, there are eight clusters, one per every company includes the company synonyms grouped together, which indicates that CompanyName2Vec successfully suggested relevant synonyms for those companies.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6 </span>Discussion</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Upon analyzing the results presented in the previous section, we can conclude the following:
First, the novel approach we call CompanyName2Vec, which defines a vector representation of company names based on job ads, had promising results compared to other algorithms (see Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5 Results ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) and is helpful for the task of CEM (see Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Evaluation Process and Performance Metrics ‣ 4 Experimental Study ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>). CompanyName2Vec algorithm captures the company names semantics and manages common prefixes, suffixes, and punctuation for company synonyms, like PepsiCo’s suffixes - Inc, Corp., Co., Company, Etc. (see Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Results ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). CompanyName2Vec manages less popular suffixes as well, which may include a location or a point of interest. For example, HCA Capital Richmond is a synonym of HCA Healthcare. HCA Capital Richmond is a synonym due to the presence of HCA capital offices, which are located in Richmond, VA (see Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5 Results ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). Another example is <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Pepsi - New York</span>, which is a synonym of PepsiCo’s office in New York City (see Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Results ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>).
A company’s business line can be attached to a company name as a synonym, such as Home Depot Tools Rental (see Figure <a href="#A1.F2" title="Figure S2 ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">S2</span></a>), or Lowe’s Home Improvement (see Figure <a href="#A1.F1" title="Figure S1 ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">S1</span></a>). Home Depot Tools Rental is a synonym for Home Depot, and Lowe’s Home Improvement is the company slogan.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Second, we observed that “best partial” heuristic (see Section <a href="#S2.SS2.SSS1" title="2.2.1 Character-Based Similarity Metrics ‣ 2.2 Distance Metrics ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2.1</span></a>) works well in the case of matching company names because of its short length. The median length of a company name is 21 characters (see Figure <a href="#S5.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 5 Results ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a>), and it consists in the median case of just three words (see Figure <a href="#S5.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 5 Results ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Third, based on the method’s performance comparison (see Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5 Results ‣ CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>), we found the CompanyName2Vec outperforms the other algorithms tested, while the second-best algorithm measured is the Fuzzy distance matching.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Fourth, as for company abbreviations, due to lack of semantics in company name abbreviations, the CompanyName2Vec solution performs just as well as Fuzzy distance matching.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, we found the CompanyName2Vec method works better than the Fuzzy method mainly because the CompanyName2Vec uses the language semantic. For example, trying to match “Pepsi - New York” with “PepsiCo Inc.” and “New York Life” using Fuzzy distance matching returns “New York Life” because New York is a significant part of both names. The CompanyName2Vec method returns “PepsiCo Inc.” based on an LSTM model, which extracts the company naming semantics from the training set.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this study, we introduced CompanyName2Vec, a novel, generic open-source algorithm which uses job ads and deep learning to address some of the challenges associated with company name synonyms.
Another contribution of this study is an end-to-end, highly scalable, enterprise-grade system that uses the CompanyName2Vec algorithm to solve the CEM problem using job-ads data and requires no company’s information for matching besides its name.
We provided a comprehensive description of our algorithm’s steps, starting with collecting job ads and finding company name synonyms using the job ads fingerprinting technique and generating the company name synonyms dataset. We used text matching heuristics to reduce wrong synonyms and used the dataset to generate a Bi-LSTM model. This model generates a vector representation given any company name. We collected a set of synonyms for the Fortune 1000 companies in the United States and used them to test and compare the CompanyName2Vec algorithm with several matching algorithms.

The evaluation demonstrated that CompanyName2Vec was beneficial for confronting the problem of recommending synonyms for a given company name.

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our research uses the job ads’ description and the Winnowing algorithm for job ad fingerprinting. A possible future research direction is using a more comprehensive job ads’ fingerprinting technique using additional information than just the job description, such as work location, contact information, company logo, Etc.
Another possible research direction can be exploring other models than Bi-LSTM for name embedding, like bag-of-words, convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT).
Another avenue to pursue is learning company relations from the job ads corpus, for example, a parent company, a subsidiary, a holding company, etc.</p>
