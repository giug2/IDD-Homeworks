<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">With the increasing popularity of plugin-based software systems, ensuring the security of plugins has become a critical concern. When users install plugins or browse websites with plugins from an untrusted source, how can we be sure that they do have any undesirable functions implicitly? In this research, we present a comprehensive study on language-based security mechanisms for plugin development. We aim to enhance the understanding of access control vulnerabilities in plugins and explore effective security measures by introducing a capability-based system. We also developed and evaluated test plugins to assess the security mechanisms in popular development environments such as IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code by utilising Java, JavaScript, and associated APIs and frameworks. We also explore the concept of capability-based module systems as an alternative approach to plugin security. A comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of capability-based systems in addressing access control vulnerabilities identified in earlier sections. Finally, recommendations for improving plugin security practices and tools will be presented, emphasizing the importance of robust security measures in the ever-evolving landscape of software plugins.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.1 </span>Popular Fields: Plugin Development in Modern Software Ecosystems</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS1.p1.1">In modern software ecosystems, plugin development has become an essential part of software engineering due to its flexibility, extensibility, and cost-effectiveness, particularly for popular platforms such as IntelliJ and VScode<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib54" title="">54</a>]</cite>. Plugins are software components that extend the functionality of existing software by adding new features, capabilities, or services to enhance the user experience which allows developers to customize existing software systems or create new functionalities without altering the core codebase of the system<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib53" title="">53</a>]</cite>. Plugins can be developed by third-party developers or even end-users, making them a critical element of the software development process. The concept of plugins has not been proposed recently; it has been around for several decades. However, with the advent of modern software ecosystems, the use of plugins has become more prevalent than ever<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib20" title="">20</a>]</cite>. Modern software ecosystems are complex and dynamic, and they require a high degree of flexibility to adapt to changing user needs. Plugins provide this flexibility by allowing developers to add new features to an application without having to modify the core functionality of the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS1.p2.1">In recent years, plugin development has become an integral part of many popular software ecosystems, including web browsers, content management systems, and integrated development environments<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib37" title="">37</a>]</cite>. For example, web browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox support a wide range of plugins that allow users to customize their browsing experience and add new functionality to the browser<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib61" title="">61</a>]</cite>. Similarly, content management systems like WordPress and Drupal support a vast number of plugins that can be used to extend the functionality of the core system<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS1.p3.1">The popularity of plugin development can be attributed to several factors. First, plugins allow developers to build on top of existing software applications, which can significantly reduce development time and effort. Second, plugins can be used to add new functionality to an application without requiring changes to the core codebase, which can make it easier to maintain the application over time. Finally, plugins can be developed by third-party developers, which can help to create a vibrant ecosystem of plugins around a particular software application.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.2 </span>Challenges in plugin development</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS2.p1.1">Despite its many benefits, plugin development is not without its challenges. One of the most significant challenges facing plugin developers is security in particular this can lead to untrusted code. In plugin development, the concept of untrusted code refers to code that originates from external or unverified sources and may pose security risks to the system. Untrusted code can come in various forms, including user-submitted plugins, third-party libraries, or code obtained from the internet. While the integration of such code can enhance the functionality and versatility of plugins, it also introduces potential risks and challenges that developers must address<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS2.p2.1">One of the primary security challenges associated with untrusted code in plugin development is ensuring the integrity and authenticity of plugins. Since plugins are developed by third-party developers, there is a risk that they may contain malicious code or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. In addition, the development process of plugins may involve the use of third-party libraries or frameworks, which may also have security issues that could be exploited by attackers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib32" title="">32</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that plugins are developed using secure coding practices and undergo rigorous testing to detect and fix any vulnerabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS2.p3.1">Another significant security challenge in plugin development is the need to manage access control. Plugins can be granted varying levels of access to system resources, and any vulnerabilities in these access control mechanisms can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib19" title="">19</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is essential to implement proper access control measures to restrict plugin access to only the necessary resources and functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS2.p4.1">Moreover, plugins may have dependencies on other plugins or libraries, which can introduce security risks. These dependencies may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib64" title="">64</a>]</cite>. As a result, it is essential to monitor and update plugins and their dependencies regularly to ensure they are secure and free of vulnerabilities.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.SS3.p1.1">In spite of plugin development bringing numerous benefits, there are significant security challenges associated with it. Access control vulnerabilities are critical security issues in plugin development that can result in serious consequences, such as data breaches and system compromises. Therefore, the primary objective of this thesis is to evaluate the effectiveness of language-based security mechanisms in preventing access control vulnerabilities in plugin development by exploring the security challenges that arise from unexpected access to files, networks, and other parts of the application<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib63" title="">63</a>]</cite>. We aim to investigate the current state of security in plugin development, the existing solutions, and their limitations, and also investigate capability-based module systems’ potential to address these vulnerabilities.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p1.1">Plugins are an essential component in modern software ecosystems, allowing developers to extend the functionality of existing software. The development of plugins has been facilitated by the availability of a range of programming languages, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p2.1">One of the most popular programming languages for developing plugins is Java, due to its platform independence, object-oriented design, and widespread adoption. Java plugins can be used across multiple platforms and operating systems, and can be easily distributed to end-users<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib58" title="">58</a>]</cite>. The Gradle provides a standard framework for developing Java plugins, enabling developers to create reusable and interoperable components<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p3.1">Other programming languages that are commonly used for plugin development include C++, Python, and JavaScript. C++ is popular for developing plugins that require high performance, such as those used in video games or graphics-intensive applications. Python is commonly used for scripting plugins, due to its ease of use and flexibility. JavaScript is widely used for web-based plugins, such as those used in web browsers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p4.1">The history of plugin development dates back to the early days of software development. One of the first instances of plugin development can be traced back to the Emacs editor in the 1970s<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib30" title="">30</a>]</cite>. Emacs provided a framework for users to extend the editor’s functionality through the use of Lisp scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p5.1">In the 1990s, plugins became more widespread with the advent of web browsers. Browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer allowed developers to create plugins that extended the browser’s functionality, such as the Adobe Flash plugin for playing multimedia content<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Integrated development environment(IDE)</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS2.p1.1">An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. IDEs generally consist of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib21" title="">21</a>]</cite>. IDEs help developers write, compile, and debug their code more efficiently, with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and error checking. IDEs also provide support for version control systems, testing frameworks, and other tools that help developers write better software.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS2.p2.1">There are several popular IDEs used in plugin development, including the IntelliJ platform and VS Code. The IntelliJ platform is a popular Java IDE developed by JetBrains. It provides a range of tools for Java developers, including support for multiple languages, debugging, and code completion.[17] The IntelliJ platform also includes a plugin development kit, which allows developers to create custom plugins for IntelliJ<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib52" title="">52</a>]</cite>. It has a modular architecture that allows it to be extended using plugins, making it a popular choice for plugin development.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS2.p3.1">VS Code, on the other hand, is a lightweight, cross-platform code editor developed by Microsoft. It has quickly become one of the most popular code editors in the world, thanks to its ease of use and wide range of extensions. It supports a range of programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib57" title="">57</a>]</cite>. VSCode has a powerful extension system that enables developers to customize the IDE’s features and functionality.[20] This makes it a popular choice for plugin development, especially for web and cloud-based applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS2.p4.1">Both IntelliJ and VS Code provide powerful tools for plugin development, but they also introduce new security challenges. For example, plugins can be a source of vulnerabilities in an IDE. If a plugin is not properly designed or implemented, it can provide a way for an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions on the user’s system. IDEs also introduce new attack surfaces, since they have access to a wide range of system resources and can interact with third-party libraries and services.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p1.1">Access control is the process of managing the permission to access resources in a system. Access control mechanisms are typically based on two key concepts: authentication and authorization<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib62" title="">62</a>]</cite>. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, while authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on the user’s role or permissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS3.SSS1.p2.1">Access control vulnerabilities in plugins arise when developers fail to implement effective access control mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of data and functionality. Attackers can exploit access control vulnerabilities in plugins to gain elevated privileges, execute unauthorized actions, and access sensitive data. This kind of vulnerability can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as weak or default passwords, improper authentication mechanisms, and insecure communication channels<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib16" title="">16</a>]</cite>. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete critical files, or execute malicious code on the system<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib47" title="">47</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p2.1">One of the most common consequences of access control vulnerabilities in plugins is data theft. When an attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data, they can steal it for their own purposes or sell it on the black market. This can have serious implications for individuals, businesses, and even governments, as it can lead to identity theft, financial losses, and other types of fraud.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p3.1">Another consequence of access control vulnerabilities in plugins is system compromise. Attackers can use these vulnerabilities to gain control of a system and execute arbitrary code, which can be used to launch further attacks or cause damage to the system. For example, an attacker could use a plugin vulnerability to install malware on a system, which could then be used to steal data, monitor user activity, or launch other types of attacks.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS4.p1.1">Security is a major concern in plugin development, as plugins are often granted privileged access to a user’s system and can potentially be exploited by attackers. Therefore, it is important to implement effective security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of the plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS4.p2.1">There are various security mechanisms that can be implemented in plugin development. One approach is to use language-based security mechanisms, which are designed to prevent security vulnerabilities at the language level<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>. This type of security mechanism involves the use of programming languages that have built-in security features<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib49" title="">49</a>]</cite>. For example, languages such as Java have built-in security features that help prevent memory corruption and buffer overflow attacks and a built-in security manager that can be used to restrict access to resources or prevent malicious code execution<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib18" title="">18</a>]</cite>. Similarly, C# has a security model that allows developers to create secure applications by implementing code access security and role-based security. These languages also have automatic garbage collection, which helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related security issues<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib39" title="">39</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib50" title="">50</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib51" title="">51</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS4.p3.1">Another approach is to use capability-based security, which is designed to prevent unauthorized access to resources by only allowing authorized parties to access them. Capability-based security relies on the principle of least privilege, which means that users and plugins should only be granted the minimum amount of access necessary to perform their tasks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib41" title="">41</a>]</cite>. This approach is often used in web browser extensions, where plugins are only given access to certain resources such as cookies or browser history<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib34" title="">34</a>]</cite>. Capability-based security can be implemented using various techniques such as sandboxes, access control, and virtual machines. Sandboxing, for example, is a technique that involves isolating a plugin or a program from the rest of the system to prevent it from accessing sensitive resources or data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib33" title="">33</a>]</cite>. Access control, on the other hand, refers to the use of policies and rules to regulate access to resources and prevent unauthorized access<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib26" title="">26</a>]</cite>. Virtual machines can also be used to implement capability-based security by providing a secure execution environment for the plugin or program<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

For example, plugins can be digitally signed to ensure their authenticity and integrity. Digital signatures are used to verify that a plugin has not been tampered with since it was signed and to ensure that it comes from a trusted source<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib60" title="">60</a>]</cite>.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS2.SSS5.p3.1">Another limitation is related to the self-reported data collected in this study. Self-reported data can be subject to bias and may not accurately reflect participants’ actual behaviours or experiences. To mitigate this limitation, efforts were made to ensure that participants understood the questions being asked and that they felt comfortable providing honest answers. However, it is still possible that some participants may have provided inaccurate or incomplete responses.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS2.SSS5.p4.1">A third limitation was the potential for confounding variables. Confounding variables are variables that can influence the outcome of the study but are not measured or controlled for. To address this limitation, the study used a randomized controlled design, which helps to control for confounding variables.
Finally, it is important to acknowledge the limitations related to the experimental design of this study. While efforts were made to minimize bias through randomization and blinding procedures, it is still possible that other factors may have influenced the results.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.p2.1">The highlighter plugin provides a simple interface for highlighting text in the application. It consists of a single class that implements the necessary interfaces for the plugin architecture. The highlighter plugin is activated when the user selects text in the interface of the IDE and right clicks the word and clicks highlight in the pop-up menu. Once activated, the plugin adds a highlight to the selected text as well as all other exact same words in the file and notifies the plugin manager of the change.</p>

The file manipulator class is responsible for opening, reading, and writing files, while the highlighter class is responsible for handling the highlighting of text. When the users execute the highlighting function, the file manipulator class is also called to open the file, write the arbitrary texts, save the file, or even create a brand new file.</p>

The network manipulator class is responsible for opening a connection to the remote server, sending the information we set before as Google Forms, and receiving a response. The highlighter class is responsible for handling the highlighting of text. When the user clicks the send button, the network manipulator class is called to send any data that may be retrieved from users’ computers or is pre-filled to the remote server.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.p2.1">For the basic highlighter plugin, shown in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4.1 A brief description of plugins ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ Evaluating the Language-Based Security for Plugin Development"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we aimed to develop it as other common highlighters in the marketplace which is supposed to have one simple function. The interactions with users should keep as easy and handy as possible. In our design, the user can choose any words or sentences by double-clicking or selecting the sentence, then right-clicking selected words, there will be a pop-up menu in which an additional option will be shown named “Highlight”. When users click this option, the highlighting procedure will be triggered, and a dialogue that contains three different colour schemes will pop up for users to choose any colour they want. After the colour is confirmed, the markup model will mark all words which have the exact same pattern as selected words as shown in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4.1 A brief description of plugins ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ Evaluating the Language-Based Security for Plugin Development"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>,</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.p3.1">For the highlighter with file manipulator, the workflow is illustrated in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.2 Design and workflow of plugins ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ Evaluating the Language-Based Security for Plugin Development"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, it has another malicious function that can access to user’s file system and execute operations that we defined implicitly. To show them intuitively, we used dotted lines to present the implicit operations and simplify the basic highlighter function. To be more specific, when users click the highlight option, the hidden file manipulator will also be triggered. It can first generate a new file containing arbitrary data by IO File and employ the local file system to find the path where this file should be created. After the operation of creation is finished, it also invokes the virtual file system (VFS) to examine whether this file is created successfully or not.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS2.p4.1">The operating mechanism and workflow are quite similar to the previous plugin for the highlighter with network manager. As shown in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Design and workflow of plugins ‣ 4 Design and Implementation ‣ Evaluating the Language-Based Security for Plugin Development"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the plugin will also trigger another implicit function that can send a post request to the web server. More specifically, it will generate an HTTP client automatically and then set the necessary parameters for all entries that we defined. After that, the HTTP client will send a post request with data that can be pre-filled or retrieved from the user’s computers to Google Forms so that we can collect them by checking the responses in the Google form.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS4.p13.1">4. settings.gradle:
An optional file is used to define project-specific settings, such as the project name, modules, and subprojects.
It is commonly used for multi-project setups to specify the project structure.
These structures provide a foundation for developing IntelliJ plugins using Gradle as the build system. They ensure organization and proper integration within the IntelliJ IDEA platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS4.p14">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS4.p14.1">The first one is a highlighter plugin, which is the foundation for the other two plugins and was implemented using the Java programming language and the IntelliJ IDEA development environment. The plugin leveraged the IntelliJ platform’s APIs for interacting with the editor, selecting the text, and applying markup highlighting. This choice of programming language and development environment was ideal for creating a plugin that seamlessly integrated with the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. It allowed for direct access to the editor and other necessary components of the IDE, enabling efficient highlighting of selected text. The implementation process involved understanding the API documentation, studying code samples, and experimenting with different approaches to achieve the desired functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS4.p15">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS4.p15.1">When adapting the highlighter plugin for the file manipulator functionality, additional implementation steps were required. This involved integrating file system operations, such as retrieving specified files and creating a new file, into the existing plugin. The Java File and I/O APIs were utilized to manipulate files while maintaining compatibility with the IntelliJ platform. Careful error handling and permissions management were implemented to ensure the security and proper functioning of the plugin. Here we encountered a problem that some operating systems such as macOS have a special mechanism named system integrity protection (SIP) which is used to protect critical system files and directories from unauthorized modifications, even by users with administrative privileges. It is a security feature introduced in OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) and later versions of macOS<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>. It restricts both system processes and third-party applications from modifying specific protected areas of the file system, including certain system directories, system files, and kernel extensions. In our experiments, we cannot create or modify any files in the root folder of the macOS system.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS4.p16">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS4.p16.1">Similarly, for the network manipulator functionality, the highlighter plugin was extended to interact with a Google Form for data submission. This plugin included the capability to send data to a Google Form with pre-filled information. The implementation involved using HTTP client libraries and APIs to make requests to the Google Form endpoint and send the form data. This required integrating HTTP client libraries, such as Apache HttpClient, to send POST requests to the Google Form’s URL with the pre-filled information. Proper handling of network connectivity, error responses, and anonymity considerations was addressed during the implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS4.p17">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS4.p17.1">Throughout the implementation process, various challenges were encountered and resolved. One challenge was ensuring compatibility and proper integration with the IntelliJ platform’s APIs. This required a deep understanding of the platform’s architecture and documentation. Additionally, handling exceptions and errors gracefully to provide a consistent experience for users without being aware of anything special was a significant consideration during implementation.</p>

Users can right-click the exact file and choose the check file option, then a dialogue will pop up which shows the information of this file such as the data of creation, last modification, and the size of this file. It is also integrated with two similar malicious functions as IntelliJ plugins. The file manipulator is implemented by the original APIs from VS code which are path and fs which can interact with the VS Code editor and file system, allowing the plugin to read file metadata, create new files, and perform other file-related operations. The network manipulator was implemented as a Visual Studio Code extension using JavaScript, along with additional libraries such as ’isomorphic-fetch’ for making HTTP requests. This implementation allowed the plugin to send data to external endpoints, such as submitting form data to a Google Form. The use of JavaScript and the provided libraries facilitated communication with remote servers and the handling of HTTP requests.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p2.1">During the testing phase, various scenarios and use cases were explored to evaluate the behaviour and security of the plugins. The tests conducted on the plugins revealed important findings regarding their behaviour and impact on the security of the host system. The test results showed that the plugins, including their malicious functionalities, were able to perform their intended actions without triggering any alerts or warnings. The plugins successfully highlighted text, manipulated files, and interacted with external resources, such as submitting form data to a Google Form, without being blocked or detected. This indicates a potential vulnerability in the current security mechanisms of the plugin development environment.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p3.1">The implications of the test results are significant for improving plugin security. Any vulnerabilities or weaknesses identified in the plugins can serve as valuable lessons for enhancing their security mechanisms. The implications are also significant for improving plugin security. Firstly, it raises concerns about the lack of effective access control mechanisms within the plugin development environment. The plugins were able to gain extensive access to the user’s file system and network resources, allowing them to perform potentially malicious actions without being detected. This highlights the need for stronger access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive data. By understanding the specific areas where the plugins may be susceptible to attacks or misuse, developers can take proactive measures to address these issues and strengthen the overall security posture of the plugins.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p2.1">The success of publishing the plugins with malicious functions also reflects a significantly serious issue which is untrusted code. In the context of plugin development, the code is totally under the control of the plugin developer and can potentially introduce security risks and vulnerabilities. It is crucial to understand and address the risks associated with untrusted code to ensure the overall security and integrity of the plugin ecosystem. The developer can easily take control or invade the users’ devices through plugins if the marketplace lacks efficient and accurate assessments for plugins.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p3.1">Executing untrusted code poses several risks and challenges. One of the primary concerns is the possibility of code injection attacks, where malicious code is embedded within the untrusted code and executed within the plugin environment. These attacks can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise. Additionally, untrusted code may contain vulnerabilities or exploitable flaws that can be leveraged by attackers to compromise the plugin or the host system.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p4.1">To emphasize the significance of addressing the risks of untrusted code, it is essential to examine real-world case studies that highlight security incidents related to its execution. For example, the well-known ”Cross-Site Scripting” (XSS) vulnerability has been exploited through untrusted code in various web-based plugins, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts and steal sensitive information from users<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib17" title="">17</a>]</cite>.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1">In recent years, capability-based module systems have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing security in plugin development. These module systems provide a different paradigm for access control and security compared to traditional language-based security mechanisms. In this section, we will introduce capability-based module systems, with a focus on one specific example called Wyvern.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1">Capability-based module systems rely on the concept of capabilities, which are unforgeable tokens that grant specific permissions or access rights<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib24" title="">24</a>]</cite>. These capabilities act as a form of authorization, ensuring that only authorized components or modules can interact with each other. Unlike traditional access control mechanisms that rely on static privileges assigned to users or code, capabilities provide a more fine-grained and dynamic approach to access control<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib42" title="">42</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1">The capability-based module system operates based on two key concepts: confinement and authority. Confinement ensures that modules have restricted access to their internal state and can only communicate with other modules through well-defined interfaces. Authority, on the other hand, grants specific privileges to modules, allowing them to perform certain actions or access protected resources<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib29" title="">29</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p4.1">Wyvern is a programming language that embraces the capability-based approach to module systems<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib45" title="">45</a>]</cite>. It is designed to enforce strong access control guarantees through the use of capabilities. In Wyvern, modules are treated as first-class citizens, and access to module resources is governed by capabilities<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib40" title="">40</a>]</cite>. Modules can only be accessed if the corresponding capabilities are possessed by the requesting code. This fine-grained control enables precise control over access to sensitive operations or resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p5.1">The use of capability-based module systems in plugin development offers several potential advantages. Firstly, it provides a clear separation of concerns between modules and their associated capabilities. This separation allows for better encapsulation and modularity, reducing the likelihood of unintended interactions or security breaches. Secondly, capabilities enable dynamic and context-specific authorization, allowing modules to be granted or revoked access to resources based on runtime conditions. This flexibility enhances security by adapting access permissions to changing circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p6.1">Research and previous studies have highlighted the potential of capability-based module systems in addressing access control vulnerabilities. For example, capabilities can mitigate privilege escalation attacks by ensuring that only authorized modules possess the necessary capabilities to perform privileged operations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib23" title="">23</a>]</cite>. Additionally, capability-based systems can prevent unauthorized code execution by enforcing strict access control based on the possession of specific capabilities<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib59" title="">59</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p7.1">However, it is important to acknowledge that capability-based module systems also have certain limitations and challenges. One challenge is the complexity of managing and controlling capabilities, especially in large-scale plugin ecosystems. Designing effective policies for distributing, revoking, and managing capabilities can be a non-trivial task<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the adoption of capability-based systems may require changes to existing development practices and tooling, which can introduce a learning curve and potential resistance from developers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.07448v1#bib.bib48" title="">48</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1">In this section, we will compare the effectiveness of capability-based and language-based systems in the context of security mechanisms for plugin development. Both approaches offer different strategies for addressing access control vulnerabilities and enhancing overall security in plugin ecosystems. We will examine their key characteristics, security mechanisms, and their potential to address the access control vulnerabilities identified in previous sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1">Capability-based systems, such as the Wyvern programming language, take a fundamentally different approach to security compared to traditional language-based systems. In a capability-based system, access control is based on the possession of capabilities, which are unforgeable tokens that grant specific rights and permissions to access resources or perform operations. Capabilities are typically unguessable and cryptographically secure, ensuring that only authorized entities possess the necessary permissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p3.1">On the other hand, language-based systems rely on language-level constructs, such as access modifiers and type systems, to enforce access control. These systems define a set of rules and restrictions within the programming language itself to govern the behavior and interactions between different components. Access to resources and operations is controlled through the use of language features, ensuring that only authorized code can invoke certain functions or access specific data. For example, encapsulation and information hiding provided by access modifiers can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. However, language-based systems may still be susceptible to vulnerabilities such as code injection or privilege escalation if not properly designed and implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p4.1">When comparing capability-based and language-based systems for plugin development, both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. Capability-based systems have shown promise in addressing access control vulnerabilities. They offer strong isolation between components and can prevent unauthorized access to resources. By carefully managing and restricting capabilities, the risk of unauthorized or malicious operations can be minimized. This helps prevent privilege escalation and limits the impact of potential vulnerabilities. Language-based systems, with their focus on static analysis and type checking, can detect many access control vulnerabilities during development and provide a safer programming environment. They provide compile-time checks and static analysis that can catch many security issues before runtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p5.1">However, both approaches have limitations. Capability-based systems require careful management and assignment of capabilities, which can be challenging in complex systems. Language-based systems rely on developers correctly using language features and following security best practices, which may not always be guaranteed in particular the test results showed that a plugin with malicious functions can be published successfully without any supervision.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p6.1">In terms of addressing the access control vulnerabilities identified in previous sections, we find that they offer unique security mechanisms that can effectively address access control vulnerabilities. The cryptographic nature of capabilities ensures that only authorized entities can exercise certain permissions, mitigating the risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, capability-based systems provide a clear separation of authority and privilege, making it easier to reason about access control and identify potential security vulnerabilities.</p>

</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS2.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS2.p6.1">It is worth noting that while these current practices and tools provide valuable contributions to plugin security, they also have their limitations. Static code analysis tools may generate false positives or miss certain types of vulnerabilities, and penetration tests may not uncover all possible attack vectors. Ongoing research and development in the field are needed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS2.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS2.p7.1">Overall, the adoption of a combination of static and dynamic analysis, secure coding practices, continuous monitoring, and incident response procedures represents the current state of the art in evaluating security in plugin development. However, the dynamic nature of the threat landscape and lack of comprehensive supervision of publishment necessitate ongoing vigilance and adaptation of these practices to address emerging security challenges.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p1.1">In this article, we have examined the importance of security mechanisms in plugin development and explored the effectiveness of language-based security mechanisms in preventing access control vulnerabilities. We also introduced the capability-based system to compare two different systems and discussed their advantages and limitations. The research has provided valuable insights into the evaluation of security mechanisms and current practices in plugin development. This section summarizes the key findings and contributions of the research and discusses the limitations of the study along with future research directions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p2.1">One of the key findings of the study indicates that the development, publishment, and deployment of plugins are not under effective and precise surveillance. Through the evaluation of test plugins, we have identified various access control vulnerabilities and demonstrated that language-based security mechanisms are not effective in mitigating these vulnerabilities and distinguishing the aim of plugins. The use of programming languages such as Java and JavaScript, along with development environments like IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code, has shown incompetence in providing robust security features and facilitating secure plugin development. The evaluation of the test plugins provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of language-based security mechanisms. The analysis of the results highlighted the importance of considering the security implications of plugins and the need for robust access control mechanisms. The test plugins demonstrated various malicious functionalities, such as file manipulation and network interaction, which underscored the potential risks associated with untrusted code.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p3.1">Another one of the significant contributions of this research is the evaluation of different programming languages and their security mechanisms in plugin development. By examining case studies and real-world examples, we also have highlighted the strengths and limitations of two different systems which are language-based and capability-based in addressing access control vulnerabilities. These insights can guide developers in making informed decisions regarding language selection and security mechanisms for their plugin projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.p4.1">However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The evaluation of security mechanisms was conducted based on a specific set of test plugins, and the findings may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of real-world plugin scenarios. Additionally, the study focused primarily on language-based security mechanisms and did not explore other security approaches extensively. Future research should aim to address these limitations and expand the scope of evaluation to encompass a broader range of plugins and security mechanisms in other popular IDEs.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">7.1 </span>Future work</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.SS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS1.p1.1">In light of the conclusions drawn from this research, several future research directions can be identified. First and foremost, there is a need for further exploration of capability-based module systems in the context of plugin development like Wyvern. These systems have shown promise in addressing access control vulnerabilities and providing fine-grained security controls. Investigating their applicability, effectiveness, and integration with existing plugin ecosystems would be valuable.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.SS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS1.p2.1">Additionally, the development of automated security analysis tools tailored specifically for plugin development is an area of potential future work. These tools can assist developers in identifying and mitigating security risks by analyzing the codebase, dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities. Such tools would enhance the overall security posture of plugins and contribute to the prevention of malicious activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.SS1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS1.p3.1">Furthermore, the evaluation of security mechanisms should be extended to other dimensions, such as performance and scalability. Understanding the impact of security mechanisms on the performance and resource utilization of plugins is crucial for balancing security and efficiency. Exploring optimization techniques and trade-offs in the context of plugin security can lead to more robust and efficient solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.SS1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS1.p4.1">Lastly, collaboration and knowledge-sharing among researchers, developers, and the plugin development community are essential for advancing the field of language-based security. Platforms for exchanging best practices, sharing case studies, and fostering discussions should be established to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge and encourage collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S7.SS1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S7.SS1.p5.1">In conclusion, this thesis has shed light on the importance of security mechanisms in plugin development and how access vulnerabilities can be addressed by capability-based systems. The findings emphasize the need for careful consideration of programming languages, development environments, and security practices when developing plugins. By addressing the limitations identified and pursuing future research directions, we can enhance the security landscape of plugin development and contribute to the overall resilience and trustworthiness of software ecosystems.</p>
