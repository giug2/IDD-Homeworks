<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The efficiency of Federated Learning (FL) is often affected by both data and device heterogeneities. Data heterogeneity is defined as the heterogeneity of data distributions on different clients. Device heterogeneity is defined as the clients’ variant latencies in uploading their local model updates due to heterogeneous conditions of local hardware resources, and causes the problem of staleness when being addressed by asynchronous FL. Traditional schemes of tackling the impact of staleness consider data and device heterogeneities as two separate and independent aspects in FL, but this assumption is unrealistic in many practical FL scenarios where data and device heterogeneities are intertwined. In these cases, traditional schemes of weighted aggregation in FL have been proved to be ineffective, and a better approach is to convert a stale model update into a non-stale one. In this paper, we present a new FL framework that leverages the gradient inversion technique for such conversion, hence efficiently tackling unlimited staleness in clients’ model updates. Our basic idea is to use gradient inversion to get estimations of clients’ local training data from their uploaded stale model updates, and use these estimations to compute non-stale client model updates. In this way, we address the problem of possible data quality drop when using gradient inversion, while still preserving the clients’ local data privacy. We compared our approach with the existing FL strategies on mainstream datasets and models, and experiment results demonstrate that when tackling unlimited staleness, our approach can significantly improve the trained model accuracy by up to 20% and speed up the FL training progress by up to 35%.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a></cite>] uses multiple clients to collaboratively train a global machine learning (ML) model, while retaining their local data privacy. In a vanilla FL framework, each client downloads the global model from the server and trains it with the local data. Clients then upload their locally trained models as updates to the server for aggregation to update the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL could be affected by both data and device heterogeneities. <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Data heterogeneity</em> is defined as the heterogeneity of data distributions on different clients, which makes local data distributions to be non-i.i.d. and deviate from the global data distribution [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a></cite>]. This disparity could make the aggregated global model biased and reduces model accuracy [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a></cite>]. Most existing work addresses data heterogeneity by adopting different training strategies at local clients, such as adding a regularizer [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a></cite>] or an extra correction term to address client drifts [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a></cite>].</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Device heterogeneity</em>, on the other hand, arises from clients’ heterogeneous conditions of local hardware resources (e.g., computing power, memory space, network link speed, etc), which result in clients’ variant latencies in uploading their model updates. If the server waits for slow clients to complete aggregation and update the global model, the speed of training will be slowed down. An intuitive solution to device heterogeneity is asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL), which immediately updates the global model whenever having received a client update [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a></cite>]. Since a model update from a slow client is computed based on an outdated global model, this update will be <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stale</em> when aggregated at the server, affecting model convergence and reducing model accuracy. To tackle such <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">staleness</em>, weighted aggregation can be used in AFL, to apply a reduced weight on a stale model update in aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">All the existing techniques, even when simultaneously tackling data and device heterogeneities [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a></cite>], consider these two heterogeneities as separate and independent aspects in FL. This assumption, however, is unrealistic in many FL scenarios where data and device heterogeneity are <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">intertwined</em>. For example, data samples in certain classes or with particular features may only be produced from some slow clients, such as embedded and IoT devices that are deployed in special conditions (e.g., at remote sites or inside human bodies) and hence have strict resource constraints. In these cases, if reduced weights are applied to stale model updates from these slow clients, some important knowledge in these updates may not be sufficiently learned, leading to low prediction accuracy in these classes or with these features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Instead, a better approach is to convert a stale model update into a non-stale one. Existing techniques for such conversion, however, are limited to a small amount of staleness. For example, Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent with Delay Compensation (DC-ASGD) can be used for first-order compensation of the gradient delay [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a></cite>], but it assumes that staleness is sufficiently small to ignore all the high-order terms in the difference between stale and non-stale model updates. Hence, staleness is usually limited to communication delays and is always smaller than one epoch [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a></cite>]. In contrast, our experiments show that when staleness grows beyond one epoch, the compensation error will quickly increase (Section 2).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In practical FL scenarios, it is not uncommon to witness excessive or even unlimited staleness in clients’ model updates, especially in the aforementioned cases where the client devices have very limited computing power, local energy budget, or communication capabilities. To efficiently tackle such <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">unlimited staleness</em>, in this paper we present a new FL framework which uses gradient inversion at the server to convert stale model updates. Gradient inversion [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a></cite>] is a ML technique that recovers training data from a trained model by mimicking the model’s gradient produced with the original training data. With such training data being recovered by gradient inversion from stale model updates, we can use the recovered data to retrain the current global model, as an estimation to the client’s unstale model update. Compared to other model inversion methods, such as training an extra generative model [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a></cite>] or optimizing input data with extra constraints [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a></cite>], gradient inversion does not require any auxiliary dataset nor the client model to be fully trained.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The major challenge, however, is that quality of recovered data will drop and hence affect the FL performance, especially when a large amount of data samples is recovered, because gradient inversion permutes the learned information from the model’s gradient across data samples. To minimize the impact of such data quality drop, our basic idea is to avoid any direct use of recovered data samples. Instead, we use gradient inversion at the server to obtain an estimated distribution of clients’ training data from their stale model updates, such that the model with such estimated data distribution will exhibit a similar loss surface as that of using the clients’ original training data. Such estimated data distributions are then used to compute the non-stale model updates. In this way, the server will not obtain any client’s raw data samples, hence protecting the clients’ data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Another challenge is the gradient inversion’s own impact on FL, which is produced due to imperfect estimation of clients’ training data. While such impact is invariant throughout the whole FL procedure, the impact of staleness could gradually diminish as the global model converges. As a result, we will need to switch back to classic AFL aggregation at the late stage of FL. We adaptively determine this switching point by timely evaluating the impact of staleness and comparing it with the estimation error in gradient inversion, and also enforce a smooth switching to prevent sudden drop of model accuracy in training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluated our proposed technique by comparing with the mainstream FL strategies on multiple mainstream datasets and models. Experiment results show that when tackling unlimited staleness, our technique can significantly improve the trained model accuracy by up to 20% and speed up the FL training progress by up to 35%. Even when the clients’ local data distributions are continuously variant, our technique can still ensure high performance of the trained model and largely performs the existing FL methods.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The most intuitive solution to staleness is weighted aggregation, but results in improper bias towards fast clients and misses important knowledge in slow clients’ model updates, when data and device heterogeneities are intertwined. To demonstrate this, we conducted experiments by using the MNIST dataset [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a></cite>] on 100 clients to train a 3-layer CNN model. We set data heterogeneity as that each client only contain samples in one data class, and set device heterogeneity as a staleness of 40 epochs on clients with data samples in class 5. Results in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1 Tackling Staleness in FL with Intertwined Data and Device Heterogeneities ‣ 2 Background and Motivation ‣ Tackling the Unlimited Staleness in Federated Learning with Intertwined Data and Device Heterogeneities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> show that, staleness will lead to large degradation of model accuracy, and using weighted aggregation will further enlarge the degradation. These results motivate us to tackle the staleness in FL by converting stale model updates to unstale ones.</p>

As shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.1 Tackling Staleness in FL with Intertwined Data and Device Heterogeneities ‣ 2 Background and Motivation ‣ Tackling the Unlimited Staleness in Federated Learning with Intertwined Data and Device Heterogeneities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, when we use the same experiment setting as above and increase the amount of staleness from 0 to 60 epochs, DC-ASGD’s first-order compensation error, measured in cosine similarity and L1-norm difference with the unstale model updates, both significantly increase. The basic reason is that higher-order terms in compensation can not be negligible as staleness becomes large. These results motivate us to further design better techniques that support accurate conversion with unlimited staleness.</p>

In the second scenario, we consider a more practical FL setting, where clients’ local data is continuously updated and data distributions are variant over time. We believe that the second setting matches the condition of many real-world applications, such as embedded sensing or camera surveillance scenarios, where environmental contexts are changing over time and introducing new knowledge into clients’ local datasets. We compare our proposed technique with the following FL training strategies, and also included the case of FL without any staleness as the baseline in comparison:</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Staleness in asynchronous FL (AFL):</span> Most existing solutions to staleness in AFL are based on weighted aggregation. For example, [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a></cite>] suggests that a model update’s weight exponentially decays with its amount of staleness, and some others use different staleness metrics to decide model updates’ weights [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a></cite>]. [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a></cite>] decides these weights based on a feature learning algorithm. These existing solutions are always biased towards fast clients, and will hence affect the trained model’s accuracy when data and device heterogeneities in FL are intertwined. Some other researchers suggest to use semi-asynchronous FL, where the server either aggregates client model updates at a lower frequency [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a></cite>] or clusters clients into different asynchronous “tiers” according to their update rates [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a></cite>]. However, doing so cannot completely eliminate the impact of staleness because the server’s aggregation still involves stale model updates.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Recovering training data:</span> We can recover the training data from stale model updates and use the recovered data to transfer knowledge from stale model updates to the global model. Such recovery can be done by training a generative model and compelling its generated data to exhibit high predictive values on the original model [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a></cite>]. Another approach is to directly optimize the randomly initialized input data until it has good performance on the original model [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a></cite>]. However, the quality of recovered data from these methods remains low. Other efforts enhance data quality by incorporating natural image priors [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a></cite>] or using another public dataset to introduce general knowledge [<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citenum"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a></cite>], but require involvement of extra datasets. Moreover, all these methods require that the original model update to be fully trained, which is usually infeasible in FL.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a new FL framework to tackle the unlimited staleness when data and device heterogeneities are intertwined, by using gradient inversion to compute non-stale model updates from clients’ stale model updates.
