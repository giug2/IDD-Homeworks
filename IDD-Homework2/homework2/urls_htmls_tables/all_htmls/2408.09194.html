<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving solution by aggregating local models without sharing data. Traditional supervised learning requires image data with labels, but data labeling involves significant manual effort. Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) utilizes Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for local training in FL, eliminating the need for labels while protecting privacy. Compared to other SSL methods, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) reduces the demand for computing resources and storage space by creating a dictionary. However, using MoCo in FSSL requires uploading the local dictionary from vehicles to Base Station (BS), which poses a risk of privacy leakage. Simplified Contrast (SimCo) addresses the privacy leakage issue in MoCo-based FSSL by using dual temperature instead of a dictionary to control sample distribution. Additionally, considering the negative impact of motion blur on model aggregation, and based on SimCo, we propose a motion blur-resistant FSSL method, referred to as BFSSL. Furthermore, we address energy consumption and delay in the BFSSL process by proposing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme, called DRL-BFSSL. In this scheme, BS allocates the Central Processing Unit (CPU) frequency and transmission power of vehicles to minimize energy consumption and latency, while aggregating received models based on the motion blur level. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed aggregation and resource allocation methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a technology that connects vehicles, road and transportation facilities to Internet, enabling intelligent interaction and information sharing among them. Advances in IoV have made many practical applications possible, e.g., automatic navigation, meteorological information and road condition monitoring, which provide convenience to drivers and self-driving system, reduce the probability of accidents and improve the efficiency of the transportation system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. These applications need robust models, which require a lot of data for training. In IoV, vehicles can continuously capture the fresh data along the moving road, including road conditions and environmental states through onboard sensors, where most of the data are captured in the form of images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Moreover, vehicles also can store the image data locally and deal with them to realize recognition and classification, which provides essential information for self-driving and driver assistance systems to aid drivers in perceiving and understanding surroundings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.2" class="ltx_p">However, the locally stored image data, denoted as local data, is usually private for vehicles, and vehicles are reluctant to share the data with each other to protect privacy. Since vehicles come from all directions, the local data they collect vary greatly. If the model, denoted as local model, is trained locally based on the local data, it may converge to a local optimum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In contrast to distributed training, Federated Learning (FL) performs a centered training and enables a Base Station (BS) to obtain a global model through aggregating local models from vehicles without sharing the local data, thereby providing a privacy-preserving solution and reducing the differences between local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. For local training, the traditional supervised learning requires the image data with labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, but data labeling requires significant manual effort. Especially in IoV, a large amount of unlabeled data is generated daily, further increasing the cost of manual labeling. The Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) leverages pretext to provide training based on the inherent properties of data, thus it can learn feature representations from the data itself without the need for manually annotated labels. The traditional SSL methods obtain a better training performance through generating and storing abundant negative samples, which occupies a lot of computing resource and storage space. Thus, traditional methods are not suitable for the resource and space limited IoV. The famous SSL method Momentum Contrast (MoCo) uses <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> values to form a dictionary and stand for the reference of negative samples, which can save computing resource and storage space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, employing MoCo in FSSL for local training will upload <math id="S1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> values to create a big dictionary in BS for aggregation, which may cause privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the training performance of FSSL in IoV may be deteriorated due to the motion blur. Specifically, excessive vehicle velocity may result in insufficient exposure time of the camera sensor, causing image blur <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The blur level of images directly impacts the accuracy and convergence of the global model. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work considering the privacy leakage and motion blur for FSSL in IoV.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The improved MoCo method Simplified Contrast (SimCo) uses dual temperature to control sample distribution to eliminate the usage of dictionary <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, thus it can greatly protect privacy and is suitable for the local training of FSSL in IoV. Considering the negative impact of motion blur on model aggregation, we also propose a motion Blur resistant FSSL, refer to as BFSSL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is noteworthy that increasing Central Processing Unit (CPU) frequency of a vehicle results in more local training iterations while consuming more energy consumption. Higher transmission power of a vehicle reduces the transmission delay, while costing more energy. Simultaneously, low CPU frequency reduces the number of local iterations within the given processing period of time, thereby diminishing the accuracy of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Additionally, low transmission power increases data interference, resulting in higher rates of transmission failure. Thus, it is critical to find a resource allocation scheme that allocates resources (i.e., CPU frequency and transmission power of vehicles) to minimize energy consumption and delay for the BFSSL, while increasing the success rate of transmission in IoV. Since the resource allocation problem is usually non-convex in the complicated IoV, the traditional convex optimization methods are difficult to solve it. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a good option to solve the non-convex problem. In this paper, we propose the DRL-BFSSL algorithm, where vehicles employs SimCo to perform locally training and sends local models to BS for blur-based aggregation. Meanwhile, BS allocates CPU frequency and transmission power to minimize the energy consumption and delay<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The source code has been released at: https://github.com/qiongwu86/DRL-BFSSL</span></span></span>.</p>

These FSSL methods mentioned above require a large number of samples for training, which imposes high demands on the computing and storage capabilities of devices. However, the computing and storage resources of vehicles are limited in IoV, thus these methods are not suitable for IoV.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the demand on computing and storage capabilities, some methods have been introduced accordingly.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no related work proposed a FSSL based on SimCo to reduce computing resource and storage space while protecting privacy in IoV. Furthermore, the training performance of FSSL in IoV may be deteriorated due to the motion blur, and there is no related work that considers motion blur in the related works that employs FSSL in IoV.

Then each training vehicle downloads the global model from the BS, along with the allocated transmission power and CPU frequency. After that each vehicle trains locally based on the global model to update its local model. In this process, each vehicle firstly randomly chooses a certain number of images from captured images as local data and subsequently conducts local training through iterations to update the local model. During the process of local training, the vehicles also capture new images for the training of next round. When the local training is finished, each vehicle adopts the downloaded transmission power to transmit its updated local model and velocity to BS. However, during the transmission process, varying signals transmitted by other vehicles may cause interference, leading to data errors that prevent the BS from receiving the uploaded local models. Finally, BS aggregates the received local models to obtain a new global model based on the motion blur. The above process is repeated in different episode to get a converged global model.</p>

We also conducted experiments on Non-IID datasets.
It can be observed that the classification accuracy of all three methods shows an upward trend after training. Among these methods, the FedCo algorithm starts with the lowest accuracy and continues to perform the worst during subsequent training. In contrast, DRL-BFSSL and FLSimCLR exhibit similar accuracy trends, but overall, DRL-BFSSL outperforms FLSimCLR in Top1 accuracy. The training performance on Non-IID datasets was slightly inferior to that on IID datasets but still superior to the FedCo and FLSimCLR algorithms.</p>

Conversely, we also implemented the FLSimCLR, which requires a large number of negative samples. FLSimCLR performs worse than DRL-BFSSL primarily due to its dependency on a large number of negative samples to learn effective representations, whereas in our experiments, we used only a few negative samples. While this approach works well in centralized settings, it faces challenges in federated environments where the distribution of negative samples may not be consistent across different clients.
The slightly lower performance on Non-IID data can be attributed to the inherent challenges in ensuring uniform representation across heterogeneous data distributions, which affects the overall consistency and learning efficiency in federated settings.</p>

The red and green lines in Fig. <a href="#S6.F6.sf1" title="In Figure 6 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Motion Blur Resistant Federated Self-Supervised Learning in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(a)</span></a> represent scenarios with 5 and 10 training vehicles, respectively. It shows an improvement in model accuracy as few vehicles participate. This indicates that as the number of vehicles participating in each round of DRL-BFSSL increases, the number of iterations decreases, indicating fewer communication rounds between training vehicles and the BS. More interactions between vehicles and the BS lead to better model performance. The red and blue lines represent scenarios with 5 training vehicles participating in DRL-BFSSL per round. The red line indicates that training vehicles perform one local iteration, while the blue line indicates two local iterations. It can be observed that the results of two internal iterations surpass those of one iteration, highlighting the advantage of multiple local training iterations even when using the same set of images for local training.
We can also observe that when 10 vehicles participate in each round of DRL-BFSSL, the initial accuracy is the lowest, and as the training rounds increase, it gradually becomes comparable to the accuracy achieved with 5 vehicles. This is because initially, the participating vehicles contribute diverse datasets. However, as the number of iterations increases, the newly added vehicles’ datasets become more similar, resulting in reduced datasets diversity. In this scenario, aggregating a small number of models in the initial stages yields better results because these models represent a wider range of datasets diversity.</p>

This suggests that the model becomes more robust and comprehensive when considering more candidate classes.

It can be observed that the loss function of each experiment exhibits a decreasing trend. Moreover, when 5 vehicles participate in each round of training with each vehicle conducting 2 iterations of local training, the loss decreases the fastest and reaches the minimum value.
At the same time, compared to the curves on the IID training set, the loss function of the model trained on the Non-IID datasets exhibits significant fluctuations in the initial stage. However, as the number of episodes increases, the trend of the loss function gradually becomes similar to that on the IID datasets.
This phenomenon can be partially attributed to the characteristics of the non-IID datasets. Due to the uneven distribution and diversity of data on the Non-IID datasets, the model faces greater challenges during training. Therefore, the loss function of the model may exhibit significant fluctuations in the initial stage. As training progresses, the model gradually adapts to the data distribution, leading to a reduction in the fluctuation of the loss function, ultimately stabilizing. Additionally, multiple rounds of internal training help the model better learn data features, allowing it to achieve lower loss values in a shorter time.</p>

<p id="S6.p15.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the results of baseline1 and baseline2, it is evident that although baseline1 does not achieve a stable convergence of loss function, compared to baseline2, its loss function reaches a smaller value. In other words, because baseline2 discards some models during aggregation, baseline2 uses the fewest number of models among these methods. This suggests that the number of models participating in aggregation is more critical than the quality of the models. Finally, our proposed aggregation method of DRL-BFSSL not only reduces the fluctuation of the loss function but also converge to a smaller value. Comparing with baseline3, it can be observed that an increasing number of blurry image data is unfavorable for the convergence of the loss function. However, compared to other aggregation methods, the convergence speed remains relatively stable.</p>

Although DDPG and TD3 exhibit some convergence trends, they are highly volatile and less stable. In contrast, the optimal solution obtained by the Random algorithm is significantly higher than that achieved by the SAC algorithm. Overall, the SAC algorithm can obtain better solutions more quickly and stably. This is mainly because SAC introduces entropy rewards to encourage policy exploration, maintaining a certain level of exploration during training.</p>

The SAC algorithm reaches a stable value in terms of computation times, while the calculation times of the DDPG algorithm fluctuate significantly. TD3 algorithm shows a similar trend to DDPG algorithm, but with smaller fluctuations. The calculation times for both DDPG algorithm and TD3 algorithm fluctuate around the stable value achieved by SAC. The Random algorithm consistently has higher calculation times than the SAC algorithm, indicating that it has not balanced the optimal problem with calculation times. We aim to have sufficient calculation times to facilitate the training of the global model while minimizing the value of optimization problem. The SAC algorithm excels in this aspect as it can utilize each update more efficiently, enhancing training efficiency.

The overall reward value of the SAC algorithm is higher than that of DDPG, TD3, and the Random algorithm. The DDPG algorithm might be affected by gradient instability when updating policies, leading to significant fluctuations during its convergence process. In contrast, TD3 algorithm exhibits less fluctuation but still has lower reward values than SAC algorithm. The Random algorithm, due to its inherent randomness, cannot effectively explore the solution space.</p>

Overall, the results of the three can converge to relatively stable values. Specifically, Fig. <a href="#S6.F9.sf1" title="In Figure 9 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Motion Blur Resistant Federated Self-Supervised Learning in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(a)</span></a> illustrates the optimal solutions under the SAC algorithm in the presence of varying numbers of interfering vehicles. When there are no interfering vehicles, the optimal solution converges to a minimum value and remains stable. However, with the introduction of interfering vehicles, the optimal solution noticeably increases. Despite this increase, as the number of interfering vehicles continues to grow, the optimal solution does not vary significantly, but ultimately converging to a relatively small and stable value. This behavior can be attributed to the SAC algorithm’s ability to adapt to increased complexity and interference, effectively maintaining a robust performance even under more challenging conditions.

As the number of interfering vehicles increases, the convergence value also rises. This is because when the number of interfering vehicles increases, the system needs to allocate more energy to the vehicles for training. Fig. <a href="#S6.F9.sf3" title="In Figure 9 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Motion Blur Resistant Federated Self-Supervised Learning in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(c)</span></a> shows a comparison of the reward function throughout the process. In general, when there are no interfering vehicles, the reward function can quickly converge to a higher value. However, as the number of interfering vehicles increases, the reward function decreases. At the same time, it can be seen that as long as interfering vehicles are introduced, the overall system reward will significantly decrease. This indicates that once interfering vehicles are added, the overall system reward will drop significantly. The increase in interfering vehicles makes management and energy allocation more complex, thereby reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of the SAC algorithm.</p>

<div id="S6.p19" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p19.1" class="ltx_p">With the absence of interfering vehicles, we train models using both the SAC, DDPG, TD3 and Random algorithms and saved their parameters for testing. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Motion Blur Resistant Federated Self-Supervised Learning in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, the overall results indicate that the optimization problem solutions produced by the SAC algorithm are smaller and more stable compared to those produced by the other algorithms. This suggests that the SAC algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of both stability and performance. This superiority is likely due to the entropy regularization strategy employed by the SAC algorithm, which allows for a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to more stable convergence to superior solutions. In contrast, the DDPG and TD3 algorithm may be more prone to getting stuck in local optima during policy optimization, resulting in lower quality and less stable solutions.</p>
