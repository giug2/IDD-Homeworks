<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is quickly becoming a goto distributed
training paradigm for users to jointly train a global model without physically
sharing their data. Users can indirectly contribute to, and
directly benefit from a much larger aggregate data corpus used to
train the global model. However, literature on successful
application of FL in real-world problem settings is somewhat
sparse. In this paper, we describe our experience applying a FL
based solution to the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task for an
adverse event detection application in the context of mass scale
vaccination programs. We present a comprehensive empirical analysis
of various dimensions of benefits gained with FL based training.
Furthermore, we investigate effects of tighter <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Differential
Privacy (DP)</em> constraints in highly sensitive settings where
federation users must enforce <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Local DP</em> to ensure strict
privacy guarantees. We show that local DP can severely cripple the
global model’s prediction accuracy, thus disincentivizing users from
participating in the federation. In response, we demonstrate how
recent innovation on <em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">personalization</em> methods can help
significantly recover the lost accuracy. We focus our analysis on
the Federated Fine-Tuning algorithm, <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">FedFT</span>, and prove that it is
<em id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">not</em> PAC Identifiable, thus making it even more attractive for
FL-based training.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed ML paradigm that enables
multiple users to jointly train a shared model without sharing their
data with any other users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">bonawitz19, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">konecny15, </a>)</cite>, offering
advantages in both scale and privacy. In FL, multiple users wish to
perform essentially the same task using ML, with a model architecture
that is agreed upon in advance. Each user wants the best possible
model for their individual use, but often has a limited budget for
labeling their own data. Pooling the data of multiple users could
improve model accuracy, because accuracy generally increases with
increased training data. However user data cannot be shipped to a
common model training facility due to bandwidth limitations or data
privacy concerns. As a result, users locally train the shared
(global) model on their local data, and thereafter send the updated
model to the <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federation server</em>. The federation server
aggregates updates received from its users to improve the global model
for all users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the initial focus of FL has been on targeting millions of
mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">bonawitz19, </a>)</cite>, also called <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cross-device FL</em>,
the benefits of its architecture are evident even for institutional
settings, also called <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cross-silo FL</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">kairouz19, </a>)</cite>. While
cross-device FL is concerned with both bandwidth consumption and data
privacy, cross-silo federations and their users are considered well
equipped with resources to handle bandwidth concerns, and data privacy
is the primary objective. Our work focuses on the cross-silo FL
setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Today our world grapples with safely rolling out massive scale
vaccination programs to end a pandemic. Understanding adverse events
related to these vaccines is critically important. These adverse
events are often expressed in free text form, such as social media
posts and reports provided to health care agencies and pharmaceutical
companies. Currently, mentions of specific adverse events are extracted and coded manually, which is a time consuming, expensive and non-scalable process. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) based methods to extract
named entities (adverse events) automatically from such unstructured
data are highly desirable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, more training data yield more
accurate models. Unfortunately, collecting human annotations for
building such Named Entity Recognition (NER) models is expensive, and
particularly challenging given the need to maintain privacy of health
records. One way to overcome this data scarcity issue would be for
various agencies to share their data to build a joint model with
combined data. However, privacy concerns, government regulation and
data use agreements might not allow the data to leave individual
organizational or geographical silos. Sharing user data with other
users is absolutely not an option in these settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Cross-silo FL makes perfect sense to address such problems. Each
vaccine provider’s data remains in its private <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">silo</em>. At the
same time, the provider can collaborate with other providers on a FL
framework to collectively improve the NER model used for adverse event
detection. Everyone benefits without violating data privacy.
More specifically, for institutions participating in a federation as
users, restricting data movement helps fulfill contractual obligations
with their customers and comply with legal regulatory constraints on
data movement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">ccpa, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">gdpr, </a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, restricting the provider’s training data to its private silo
does not guarantee complete privacy. Recent works have demonstrated
that the data can indirectly leak out through model updates shipped by
users to the federation server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">bagdasaryan20, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">melis18, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">nasr19, </a>)</cite>.
To combat this problem, researchers have proposed the addition of
Differential Privacy (DP)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">dwork06a, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">dwork14, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">dwork06, </a>)</cite> to
FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">abadi16, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">geyer17, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">konecny16, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan17, </a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Informally, DP aims to provide a bound on the variation in the model’s
output based on the inclusion or exclusion of a single data point used
in its training set. This is done by introducing precisely calibrated
noise in the training process. The method of noise calibration and
injection varys between implementations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">abadi16, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan17, </a>)</cite>, but
is always structured to enforce the precise formal DP guarantee, which
we define in <a href="#S2" title="2. Background ‣ Private Cross-Silo Federated Learning for Extracting Vaccine Adverse Event Mentions" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">section 2</span></a>. We will refer to this process
as “DP inducing noise injection” henceforth. This noise makes it
difficult, even impossible, to determine whether any particular data
point was used to train the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In settings where the federation server is trusted, DP enforcement is
delegated to the federation server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan17, </a>)</cite>. However, in
settings where users do not trust even the federation server, a
stricter form of DP, called <em id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Local DP</em>, is
enforced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">kasiviswanathan08, </a>)</cite>. While all this noise is structured
to enforce formally provable privacy guarantees for each training data
point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">dwork06, </a>)</cite>, it can significantly degrade accuracy of model
predictions. This degradation may happen to an extent that
disincentivizes users from participating in the federation – the
global (noisy) model performs worse than a user-resident local model
trained just on the user’s dataset, which we call the
<em id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">individual</em> model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Another instance where the global model may perform worse than the

</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">We are interested in applying this body of work to real-world problem
settings. The health care sector is one such application domain that
can leverage FL in significant ways. Indeed there is rapidly growing
awareness and investment at world-wide scale including
consortiums <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">melloddy, </a>)</cite> and public-private

applied research in this sector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">li20a, </a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we case study application of FL to the problem of
vaccine adverse event detection, the first of its kind to the best of
our knowledge. Importance of such a study cannot be understated in
today’s pandemic stricken world. The unprecedented speed at which new
vaccines have been rolled out, it is crucial to automatically extract
mentions of adverse events related to these vaccines from patient
reports. We study implications of applying FL to the Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System (<span id="S1.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">VAERS</span>) dataset that we have annotated and
partitioned by vaccine manufacturers. Each vaccine manufacturer acts
as a federation user whose dataset is siloed in its private sandbox;
all these sandboxes participate in our FL framework over multiple
training rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Our experiments reveal several interesting insights including general
effectiveness of FL on model performance, effects of local DP
enforcement on model performance, and the value of personalization
techniques to incentivize users to participate in FL. In particular,
we show that FL improves average F1 value by 37.43% over the
individual model, while enforcement of local DP (DP-FL) degrades the
FL model’s average F1 by 25.17%. For one of the users, this
degradation is so severe that the private FL model F1 is worse by
45.55% when compared with the individual model F1. This clearly
makes DP-FL a non-starter for some users to join the federation. We
study FL with <em id="S1.p12.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Fine-Tuning</em> (FT-FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">yu20, </a>)</cite>, a
personalization approach that fine-tunes the global model at each user
<em id="S1.p12.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">after</em> the entire FL training process completes. Interestingly,
contrary to prior work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">yu20, </a>)</cite>, simply augmenting fine-tuning to
FL does not result in prediction accuracy improvement for the
federation users. Instead, user accuracy degrades in most cases.
However, somewhat surprisingly, fine-tuning in the presence of DP
(FT-DP-FL) boosts user accuracy by 24.88%, compared to the individual
model, to strongly incentivize users to join and stay with the
federation. We also observe that vaccine reports related to different
manufacturers have slightly different vocabulary (e.g. mentions of
different vaccine names), and different distributions of adverse
events, which aid FT-DP-FL in effectively recovering lost accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p13" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p13.1" class="ltx_p">Even more interestingly, our findings indicate a unique
<em id="S1.p13.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">incentive structure</em> for users to join the federation. In
particular, we find that users with small amount of training data,
a.k.a. <em id="S1.p13.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">small</em> users, have a strong incentive to join and stay
with the federation even when local DP is enforced without
fine-tuning. This is because the user’s private dataset is so small
that any locally trained individual model performs poorly. In
contrast, even the global model that is degraded because of DP
inducing noise performs significantly better than the user’s
individual model. In short, small users have virtually no incentive
to leave the federation, and may not require additional layers of
personalization to improve the global model as long as there are
enough participants in the federation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p14" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p14.1" class="ltx_p">For users with larger amount of data, the narrative is quite
different. In particular, we observe that the global model’s
degradation due to DP inducing noise is significant enough to
disincentivize those users from participating in the federation. As a
result, if they opt for the additional layer of privacy through DP,
the importance of personalization based enhancements, which salvage
the accuracy lost due to DP inducing noise, cannot be understated.</p>

<div id="S1.p15" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p15.1" class="ltx_p">While personalization is gaining traction in the FL research

all participating users thereby initiating distributed training.
Training happens over multiple rounds. In each round, each user, on
receiving the the global model re-trains the model on its private data
and sends back the resulting parameter updates to the federation
server. The federation server aggregates updates from all users
applying them to the global model, and then ships the revised model
back to the users. The most widely used method of aggregation is

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Drug and vaccine safety surveillance relies predominantly on
spontaneous reporting systems. These systems are comprised of reports
of suspected drug/vaccine adverse events (potential side effects)
collected from healthcare professionals, consumers, and pharmaceutical
companies, and maintained largely by regulatory and health
agencies. Among other, these systems are used to detect possible
safety problems – called “signals” – that may be related to a
vaccination or the consumption of a drug. In the US, the prominent
surveillance system for vaccines is the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (<span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">VAERS</span>), created in

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The decision to train a ML model using the FL framework requires
careful analysis of privacy considerations for users’ data. More
specifically, the <em id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">meaning</em> of the term “data privacy” in a
given setting needs to be precisely understood since it has profound
implications on techniques required to enforce the desired data
privacy. For instance, in some settings, simply restricting user data
to its private silo is sufficient for the use case. On the other
hand, in settings involving highly sensitive private data (e.g. health
records of individuals), it may be desirable to ensure that even the
parameter updates shipped from the user silo to the federation server
cannot be reverse engineered by any means, external to the user, to
determine the user’s training data records. Ultimately, the level of
privacy protection must be agreed upon by all parties involved. While an exhaustive treatment of a
taxonomy of such <em id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">trust models</em> in FL is beyond the scope of this
paper, we assume that personal health records describing an adverse reaction to a vaccine are highly sensitive
private material. Consequently, they must be protected using
techniques guaranteeing the strictest data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL setting, these data records would be hosted in a participating
pharmaceutical company’s silo. The pharmaceutical company’s silo
performs the role of a user in the federation. We view Differential
Privacy (DP) as an appropriate tool to enforce privacy guarantees to
individuals’ health records. However, more careful analysis of how DP
is enforced in FL settings is required.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We have already discussed two choices available: (i) global DP, and
(ii) local DP. Other technologies such as secure multi-party
computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">yao86, </a>)</cite> and homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">gentry09, </a>)</cite>
may be worth considering, but are beyond the scope of this work.
Additional security technologies such as end-to-end encryption may be
necessary to augument to the DP solution, but is also outside the
scope of this work. The question with DP choices is: which approach
is applicable in our setting? In principle, global DP can be used in
such a setting, provided the FL service provider is under a legally
binding contract to preserve privacy of the parameter updates, thus
indirectly preserving privacy of the training data, received from the
user. However, such arrangements may not be applicable to contexts
where movement of such noise-free parameter updates is restricted by
government regulations or due to disparate privacy laws across
different jurisdictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">ccpa, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">gdpr, </a>)</cite>. As a result, local DP may
be far more attractive in such tightly constrained settings.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As stated earlier, adverse reactions to vaccines is highly sensitive
private data. Futhermore, the incentive to collaborate across
multiple jurisdictions, even continents, is extremely alluring due to
the ongoing pandemic at a global scale. As a result, local DP is the
privacy enforcement mechanism that is best suited to our setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To enforce local DP, we use the algorithm proposed by Abadi et
al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">abadi16, </a>)</cite> that injects gaussian noise (calculated using their
moments accountant algorithm) in parameter gradients during local
training at each user. Nosiy gradients lead to noisy parameter
updates, which are eventually shipped from the user to the federation
server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Interestingly, since users can possess datasets with different sizes,
the computed noise, which is a function of the dataset size, varys
considerably from user to user. For instance, the noise introduced
for a user with a handful of data points is much higher than the noise
introduced by a user with a much larger private dataset. However,
<span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">FedAvg</span> smoothes out the noisy updates through the parameter
aggregation process (averaging, in our case). The resulting model

significantly improve accuracy of the global model, introduction of
noise to enforce DP can severely compromise that improvement. The
degradation can be severe enough to make users reconsider their
decision to join the federation, and deter new users from joining the
federation. Furthermore, data distributions across users may have
significant side effects on the global model’s prediction accuracy: If
a user’s dataset has a significantly different distribution than most
of the federation users, the global model may perform worse than a
locally trained individual model. If users of a federation have
non-IID data, the resulting global model may be

can see, the FL model consistently outperforms <em id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Ind</em> models for each
of the users, including large manufacturers with a lot of training
data. As table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.3. Private Federated Learning with Personalization ‣ 5. Experiments ‣ Private Cross-Silo Federated Learning for Extracting Vaccine Adverse Event Mentions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows, the
amount of error reduction over the <em id="S5.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Ind</em> model for each user is substantial.
Contrary to findings by Yu et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">yu20, </a>)</cite>, in our case,
personalization based on fine tuning <em id="S5.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FT-FL</em> performs worse than
<em id="S5.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FL</em> in most cases. As we add noise related to differential privacy to
the federated learning model, F1 values drop significantly across the
board. This makes participation for larger manufacturers in the
federation unattractive, since the <em id="S5.SS3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DP-FL</em> model ends up performing
worse than their <em id="S5.SS3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Ind</em> models. However, applying fine tuning in this
case helps bring it back up to the point, where it is again
advantageous for each party to participate in the federation. This
shows that personalization based approach can help mitigate the loss
of accuracy from introducing differential privacy.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is interesting to note that for small manufacturers, with an

with or without personalization. For large manufacturers however, the
DP is only attractive in the presence of the mitigation offered by

<div id="S5.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Building a federation across organizations can be challenging in the
real world due to a variety of factors. For instance, users may
discontinue their participation in the federation.
We simulate this scenario and study the effect of
one of the manufacturers leaving the federation. As we can see from
Tables <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.5. Stability of Federation against Users Leaving ‣ 5. Experiments ‣ Private Cross-Silo Federated Learning for Extracting Vaccine Adverse Event Mentions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.5. Stability of Federation against Users Leaving ‣ 5. Experiments ‣ Private Cross-Silo Federated Learning for Extracting Vaccine Adverse Event Mentions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, both
federated learning and private federated learning with fine tuning are
fairly stable against such a change, with the exception of a few
manufacturers with very small amount of training and test data. In
other words, no single manufacturer has disproportionally large impact
on the overall accuracy gains from participating in the federation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another scenario that we simulate is the one where only participants
with small amount of training data agree to collaborate. In this case,
we do not have the advantage of the large amount of training data from
any of the larger manufacturers.
To better understand if such a
federation is still advantageous, we compare the F1 values for small
manufacturers in two different scenarios: one, in which they are a
part of a large federation with all manufacturers, and second, in
which they are a part of a federation with only the small
manufacturers. Figures <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.6. Federation of Small Manufacturers ‣ 5. Experiments ‣ Private Cross-Silo Federated Learning for Extracting Vaccine Adverse Event Mentions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>

and FT-DP-FL respectively. As is clear from the bar chart, even in the
case of a federation with just the small manufacturers, most of the
manufacturers benefit significantly from participating. In fact, the
performance of all manufacturers in the small federation closely
tracks their performance in the large federation, with one exception.</p>

<p id="S5.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">All experiments were run on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure cluster of
Tesla V100 GPUs running a job scheduling software. The GPUs were
either 1, 2 or 8 core, with 90G, 180G, 768G memory respectively. Here
we report the actual wall clock time for training different variants
of federated learning. Training the FL model took 7.95 minutes, while
training it and tuning it for each of the users in a serial fashion
took a total of 17.10 minutes. The DP-FL model took 505.84 minutes to
train by itself and 559.34 minutes with fine tuning. The DP models
took over an order of magnitude of training time because during
training the DP noise injection code path computes and clips gradients
of individual data points in a training mini-batch before applying

Informally, in a personalized FL setting, PAC identifiability
determines whether the private model used by a federation’s user can
be leaked out to an adversarial federation server. Learning a user’s
private model can fundamentally compromise the user’s privacy. London
presents the case study of recommender systems, where the federation
server may be able to determine ratings choices made by a targeted
user. It is critical for user privacy to determine if a given
personalization approach’s user-local (private) model is PAC
identifiable. To that end we now prove that FT-FL is not PAC
identifiable.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Extracting mentions of vaccine adverse events using machine learning methods is an extremely urgent task right now. Federated Learning is a promising approach for breaking down organizational and geographical barriers to collaboration on building very effective models to solve this problem. Our work demonstrates that the loss of accuracy incurred through adding additional layers of privacy can be mitigated by introducing personalization. We show that manufacturers with dataset of all different sizes can benefit from participating in such a federation and that it is stable to potential real world changes. We also prove that adding personalization actually further enhances privacy. In the future, we would like to investigate other approaches to personalization applied to this problem domain.</p>
