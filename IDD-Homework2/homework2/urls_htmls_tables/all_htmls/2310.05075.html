<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Decentralized federated learning (DFL), inherited from distributed optimization, is an emerging paradigm to leverage the explosively growing data from wireless devices in a fully distributed manner. With the cooperation of edge devices, DFL enables joint training of machine learning model under device to device (D2D) communication fashion without the coordination of a parameter server. However, the deployment of wireless DFL is facing some pivotal challenges. Communication is a critical bottleneck due to the required extensive message exchange between neighbor devices to share the learned model. Besides, consensus becomes increasingly difficult as the number of devices grows because there is no available central server to perform coordination. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes employing over-the-air computation (Aircomp) to improve communication efficiency by exploiting the superposition property of analog waveform in multi-access channels, and introduce the mixing matrix mechanism to promote consensus using the spectral property of symmetric doubly stochastic matrix. Specifically, we develop a novel multiple-input multiple-output over-the-air DFL (MIMO OA-DFL) framework to study over-the-air DFL problem over MIMO multiple access channels. We conduct a general convergence analysis to quantitatively capture the influence of aggregation weight and communication error on the MIMO OA-DFL performance in <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ad hoc</em> networks. The result shows that the communication error together with the spectral gap of mixing matrix has a significant impact on the learning performance. Based on this, a joint communication-learning optimization problem is formulated to optimize transceiver beamformers and mixing matrix. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to reveal the characteristics of different topologies and demonstrate the substantial learning performance enhancement of our proposed algorithm.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Empowered by an unprecedented increase in local data generated by mobile edge devices, there is a surging trend in developing deep learning applications at the edge of wireless networks. These applications encompass various domains, including image recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
However, primarily due to the requirement of collecting distributed data for centralized training, traditional machine learning (ML) approaches face limitations in terms of communication bandwidth and potential privacy concerns.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that has the ability to address these challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
FL enables participating mobile devices to train a global learning model with the coordination of a parameter server (PS). In this approach, each device computes local model updates, such as model parameters or gradients, by utilizing its local datasets. These updates are then uploaded to the PS, where the averaged model is computed and subsequently broadcasted to the devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One significant limitation of FL is its heavy reliance on the central PS. FL requires aggregating all device updates at the PS, resulting in communication congestion and reduced fault tolerance. This bottleneck makes it challenging for FL to handle a massive number of devices efficiently.
Moreover, in certain application scenarios like autonomous robotics and collaborative driving<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, centralized FL may not be reliable due to the absence of an available central PS.
To address these drawbacks, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has emerged as a promising alternative. DFL eliminates the need for coordination from a central PS by enabling each device to maintain and optimize its local model. Model exchange is achieved through device-to-device (D2D) communications.
The concept of decentralized learning/optimization traces back to the 1980s<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, with algorithms like the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, dual averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and gradient descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> being well-known in this field.
More recently, decentralized stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> has gained attention as a novel algorithm for large-scale deep learning problems. DSGD ensures convergence to optimality under the assumptions on convexity, gradient, and network connectivity. This framework has been extended to accommodate various network paradigms and enhance convergence rates. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a scheme involving joint quantization, aggressive sparsification, and local computations to alleviate communication overhead. Additionally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> presents a comprehensive convergence analysis that encompasses local SGD updates, synchronous updates, and pairwise gossip processes on changing topologies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the promising potential of DFL, most of the existing works suppose error free communication links between devices while the real-world communication systems are prone to distortions. Imperfect communication conditions, including limited wireless resources, channel fading, noise, and mutual interference, can result in inaccurate model exchanges, thus hindering training performance. Additionally, transmitting model parameters through D2D communications can introduce significant communication overhead, which limits the scalability of DFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
To tackle these challenges, several recent works have focused
on the communication aspect of DFL and proposed over-the-air computation (Aircomp) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to improve
the communication efficiency in the aggregation process.
Aircomp leverages the superposition property of electromagnetic waves, enabling edge devices to transmit their model parameters simultaneously using shared radio resources. The signal is then aggregated in the wireless channel, allowing the receiver to obtain an approximation of the desired aggregated value.
For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> uses a heuristic greedy coloring algorithm to arrange the communication order and enable devices to perform computational over-the-air sequentially in successive slots under D2D networks. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> separates the communication process into scheduling and transmission parts and schedules the selected device as the active central server to enable interference-free over-the-air transmission. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> propose a one-step over-the-air scheme where all devices exchange model parameters in a single phase via full-duplex (FD) communication to accelerate the training speed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, these recent works have their limitations. Particularly,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> determine the mixing matrix based on standard examples, which may not be suitable for specific DFL systems or changing wireless conditions.
Moreover, the heuristic protocols employed in their system designs do not guarantee the optimality of DFL performance.
Although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> has evidenced the effectiveness of the over-the-air technique in improving DFL model aggregation performance, their work only focuses on beamforming optimization in fully connected topology. Hence, the lack of consideration for learning aspects and various network topologies limits the full potential release of DFL systems. Therefore, there is a pressing need to conduct theoretical analysis and performance optimization to address general DFL scenarios from a joint communication-learning perspective.</p>

Furthermore, we conduct convergence analysis to characterize the impact of mixing matrix and communication error on the DFL learning accuracy under moderate assumptions.

We assume that the global channel state information (CSI) is available. In practice, CSI can be obtained by using conventional channel estimation techniques and exploiting channel reciprocity and/or effective feedback<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we study the performance of the proposed algorithm in different network topologies and communication configurations.
We utilize the sparsity level of the mixing matrix as a characterization metric for different network topologies. The sparsity level is determined by the proportion of absent communication links, expressed as the ratio of the number of zero elements to the total number of elements in the mixing matrix, i.e., <math id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\frac{\text{number of 0 elements}}{M^{2}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mfrac id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mtext id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2a.cmml">number of 0 elements</mtext><msup id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">M</mi><mn id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">2</mn></msup></mfrac><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><divide id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"></divide><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2a.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">number of 0 elements</mtext></ci><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑀</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">2</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\frac{\text{number of 0 elements}}{M^{2}}</annotation></semantics></math>. To create different network topologies, we randomly generate the corresponding number of zero elements in the mixing matrix.
By employing this approach, we obtain network topologies with different sparsity levels and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm under four specific sparsity levels: 0%, 30%, 60%, and 90%. A sparsity level of 0% corresponds to a fully connected topology, where all communication links are present. A sparsity level of 30% encompasses topologies with relatively dense communication links. A sparsity level of 60% covers relatively sparse topologies, and a sparsity level of 90% captures extremely sparse network topologies, such as a ring or line topology.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we conduct a comparison between the proposed algorithm and conventional centralized FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> in the decentralized network. In this scenario, a centrally located device coordinates the other devices, resulting in a communication structure resembling a star topology. It is important to note that centralized FL imposes strict chronological requirements, where the central device can only broadcast the model after aggregating the local models sequentially, i.e., in an uplink and downlink fashion. Consequently, the communication latency of centralized FL is twice that of MIMO OA-DFL, even for the same number of training rounds.

We see from Fig. <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VI-B Performance of Proposed Algorithm Under Various Settings ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ Decentralized Federated Learning via MIMO Over-the-Air Computation: Consensus Analysis and Performance Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that sparse topology can achieve the highest training accuracy compared to dense topology when the number of antennas is relatively low. However, when the system has sufficient antennas, the performance of sparse topology is inferior to that of dense topology, which is particularly pronounced in terms of the minimum test accuracy (left subgraph). For the communication NMSE, topologies with sparser structures exhibit less communication error, while denser topologies demonstrate higher error. Additionally, centralized FL suffers from significant errors due to its heavy reliance on the central device. A detailed analysis of the NMSE sheds light on the learning performance behaviors.</p>

Due to limited communication resources, we see that the communication NMSE increases as the number of devices grows. The non-sparse topologies generally experience higher NMSE compared to the sparse topologies. In terms of test accuracy, with the exception of the fully connected topology, both minimum and average accuracy improve as the number of devices increases, particularly for sparser topologies. This behavior is attributed to that the second-largest squared eigenvalue decreases as the number of devices increases for a fixed sparsity level, while the impact of communication error remains insignificant within this range of device numbers. These findings highlight that in scenarios with a large number of devices, sparser topologies offer advantages due to lower communication requirements and, consequently, a better trade-off between communication and learning.</p>

Both of these schemes exhibit near-optimal performance as the error free case.
Although DC w/o MMO scheme performs well in average accuracy, it lags in minimum accuracy due to the limited performance of the consensus, which is significantly impacted by the mixing matrix. Furthermore, the MB w/o MMO scheme suffers from both communication errors and significant discrepancies in model parameters, resulting in underperformance in both subgraphs. Moreover, ZFB w/o MMO scheme, without considering channel noise, does not perform well in this configuration.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the design of the MIMO-OA DFL system over decentralized <em id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ad hoc</em> networks. We utilized a mixing matrix mechanism to promote consensus and leveraged wireless beamforming technique to improve communication quality. We derived a rigorous convergence bound in the MIMO-OA DFL scheme by capturing the impact of communication error on the decentralized learning performance. This provided a systematic attempt to characterize DFL performance considering both the learning and communication aspects. Based on this, we formulated a joint optimization problem with respect to transceiver beamformers and mixing matrix. We proposed a novel low-complexity AO algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrated the communication and learning trade-off in different topologies and verified the superiority of our proposed algorithm.</p>
