<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) counting on the mobility of massive workers helps the requestor accomplish various sensing tasks with more flexibility and lower cost. However, for the conventional MCS, the large consumption of communication resources for raw data transmission and high requirements on data storage and computing capability hinder potential requestors with limited resources from using MCS. To facilitate the widespread application of MCS, we propose a novel <span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MCS learning framework</span> leveraging on blockchain technology and the new concept of edge intelligence based on federated learning (FL), which involves four major entities, including requestors, blockchain, edge servers and mobile devices as workers.
Even though there exist several studies on blockchain-based MCS and blockchain-based FL, they cannot solve the essential challenges of MCS with respect to accommodating resource-constrained requestors or deal with the privacy concerns brought by the involvement of requestors and workers in the learning process. To fill the gaps,
four main procedures, i.e., task publication, data sensing and submission, learning to return final results, and payment settlement and allocation, are designed to address major challenges brought by both internal and external threats, such as malicious edge servers and dishonest requestors. Specifically, a mechanism design based data submission rule is proposed to guarantee the data privacy of mobile devices being truthfully preserved at edge servers; consortium blockchain based FL is elaborated to secure the distributed learning process; and a cooperation-enforcing control strategy is devised to elicit full payment from the requestor.
Extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of our designed schemes.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Facilitated by a variety of embedded sensors on mobile devices and ubiquitous Internet access opportunities, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) evolves into a vigorous paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, benefiting the data collection of Internet of Things (IoT) and various practical applications, such as transportation monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, localization and navigation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. There are also an increasing number of mobile apps based on MCS, providing great convenience for our daily lives, such as Waze and Uber. In general, the success of MCS lies in the solicitation of distributed sensing capabilities of mobile devices across a large-scale area to serve for a major task in an environmentally friendly way, which can significantly reduce the cost of deploying traditional sensors in a large number of fixed locations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, mainstream research on MCS put efforts on incentive mechanisms design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, quality control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and privacy preservation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, lacking attention on huge communication resource consumption for raw data transmission. Moreover, the large chunk of data collected from mobile workers put certain requirements on the data storage, processing and analysis capabilities of MCS requestors, which can prevent resource-constrained users from exploring and experiencing this promising computing model, thus hindering the wider application of MCS.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MCS learning framework</span> for the first time, leveraging on blockchain technology and the new concept of edge intelligence based on federated learning (FL). Four parts are involved in this framework in a top-down order, namely requestors, blockchain system, edge servers and mobile devices as workers, where the blockchain is maintained by a group of consortium members specified at the initialization of the MCS learning system while all other entities access to the blockchain via a client application.

Each can be further classified into tightly-coupled and loosely-coupled frameworks, where the tightly-coupled one employs blockchain to replace the originally centralized MCS platform or parameter aggregator in FL so as to achieve full decentralization and avoid the single point of failure, while the loosely-coupled framework implements the blockchain as an independent module to serve for some specific functions, such as the reputation management of MCS workers and FL participants. Our proposed framework compactly integrates blockchain into both MCS and FL, so the aforementioned existing schemes are not applicable to MCS learning due to the following two reasons.
On the one hand, blockchain-based MCS still suffers from the huge cost of data transmission and storage, which becomes even worse by using the blockchain since every blockchain node is supposed to hold a copy of the complete data about the main chain; besides, the requirement on data processing capability of the requestor continues to be a difficulty for resource-limited users.
On the other hand, blockchain-based FL cannot be directly employed here, either, since the additionally involved requestors and mobile workers can bring new challenges to privacy protection in FL.

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To fill the gaps, we design main procedures for our proposed MCS learning system, including i) task publication, ii) data sensing and submission, iii) learning to return final results, and iv) payment settlement and allocation. The first procedure is initiated by the requestor sending an MCS learning request and then finished via a smart contract stored on the blockchain for worker recruitment.
The second step is executed by the mobile devices and edge servers where devices undertake the sensing jobs according to the requirement of the requestor published on the blockchain and upload sensing data to the nearest edge servers for rewards. Edge servers can thus collect sensing data and establish local datasets for the next learning stage. FL is implemented in the third procedure where edge servers utilize their local data to collaboratively train the assigned machine learning (ML) model without leaking the raw data of mobile devices. And the final step is executed between the requestor and the blockchain once the task requirement is satisfied, where the blockchain system aims to successfully charge the payment from the requestor so that the fair distribution of rewards to all participants can be achieved for motivating their continuous contribution in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, there exist several challenges in the above-mentioned procedures. First, mobile devices may seriously concern whether the submitted sensing data to the edge servers can be protected from leakage; second,
the conventional FL is vulnerable to malicious attacks on the centralized aggregator; third,
the requestor might be reluctant to compensate the cost of all participants throughout the whole MCS learning process. Via solving these challenges, we make the following contributions:

To coordinate learning procedures among all participated clients, blockchain stores all learning related information, such as initial model, local updates, and globally aggregated model.
As blockchain can be classified into two general types, i.e., public and permissioned, researchers considered utilizing both blockchains in FL. For public chain based FL, FLChain was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.

After the requester publishes the MCS task to the blockchain network, mobile devices will be recruited as workers to collect data and send them to the nearest edge servers, where the raw data stored at the edge servers will be proceeded via federated learning; appropriate rewards will be distributed to all participates once the learning process finishes.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the pervasive wireless network access opportunity, there is an increasing demand for mobile crowdsensing, where mobile devices (e.g., smart phones with embedded sensors) can collect sensing data from various locations all over the world as required by the requestor. On the one hand, the huge amount of sensing data can make the data processing and analysis a big challenge for potential MCS requestors with limited computation resource, hindering the large-scale application of MCS. On the other hand, nowadays, workers in MCS become increasingly concerned about the privacy leakage during the sensing data submission process, discouraging their active participation. To solve these challenges, we propose an MCS learning system with privacy preservation based on federated learning and blockchain, by which any requestor can easily obtain the MCS data analysis results online without worrying about the sequel data processing cost while mobile devices as workers can be assured to participate in data sensing with a certain degree of privacy protection.</p>

To accomplish an MCS learning request, we consider four general procedures as follows:</p>
<ol id="S3.I1" class="ltx_enumerate">
<li id="S3.I1.ix1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">

<p id="S3.I1.ix1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.I1.ix1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Task publication.</span> The requestor sends an MCS learning request to the blockchain network, which will be recorded on the main chain with necessary task information, such as the requestor’s identity, task description, and performance requirement. This on-chain record will trigger a smart contract to recruit appropriate workers.</p>

<p id="S3.I1.ix2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.I1.ix2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Data sensing and submission.</span> After workers receive the MCS task, they collect the required data in their convenience and submit sensing data to the nearest edge server so as to alleviate its own storage burden and accelerate the whole MCS process. All sensing data collected at the edge server constitutes a private dataset, which will be locally processed during the next stage. By this means, the private information of mobile devices (e.g., location) can be preserved to some extent as the raw data will only be visible to their local edge servers rather than the centralized platform in the conventional MCS.
Besides, workers can receive sensing reward from edge servers in a timely manner.</p>

To motivate continuous contribution from all participants during the whole MCS learning process, an appropriate payment will be charged from the requestor to cover sensing rewards for mobile devices, learning rewards for edge servers, and block rewards for blockchain nodes.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, within the above working process, there exist several problems threatening the implementation of the MCS learning system. First, whether the edge server can keep the promise of protecting the data privacy for mobile devices remains an uncertainty; second, the centralized parameter aggregator in FL is prone to be attacked by both inside computation clients and outsiders, leading to the risk of inefficient learning or model breaches; third, given potential malicious requestors, it is challenging to successfully elicit enough payment from the requestor so that all contributors can be rewarded properly. All these concerns need to be carefully considered and well addressed in the detailed design of the MCS learning system, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>

By doing so, devices can expect to achieve local privacy preservation at the level of edge servers as their submitted data will be processed and analyzed by the server locally, along with the collected sensing data from other connected mobile devices, instead of being directly submitted to a global platform. Nevertheless, even with this computation paradigm, devices may still have the concern about whether edge servers can really keep the local privacy protection expectation in practice without leaking the received sensing data to other parties, which is also a private behavior for the edge server and thus can never be explicitly known to devices. To solve this concern, we take advantage of the mechanism design theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> which empowers devices to utilize the market power to restrain potential data privacy leakage behavior of edge servers.</p>

Specifically, the device has a self-evaluation on the value of the sensing data, denoted by <math id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="v" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">v</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑣</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">v</annotation></semantics></math>, to cover at least the sensing cost; and the server will decide how much profit it likes to pay to the device, denoted by <math id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">s</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝑠</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p3.2.m2.1c">s</annotation></semantics></math>, which leads to a total payment of <math id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="v+s" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">v</mi><mo id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">s</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1"><plus id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1"></plus><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑣</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3">𝑠</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p3.3.m3.1c">v+s</annotation></semantics></math> for the sensing data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the received sensing data from mobile devices, edge servers can construct their local datasets so that they can further collaboratively conduct FL to derive the global learning results for requestors. However, there always exists an aggregator, such as a central server, to coordinate the FL process among all participated computing parties. Although some research suggest multiple servers to take the work of aggregation, the logical topology is still centralized, suffering from lots of weaknesses, such as single point of failure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To fundamentally address these problems, the concept of fully decentralized FL is proposed where FL participants communicate with each other via the peer-to-peer channels. As an exemplary implementation of this concept, blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> based FL is widely studied recently as discussed in Section <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:sec:related</span>. Thus, in our proposed MCS learning framework, we also consider to employ the decentralized ledger to replace the centralized aggregator in FL, where a set of blockchain nodes undertake the coordination jobs.
Specifically, the consortium blockchain is used here, which is maintained by a group of consortium members responsible for validating all content waiting to be included on the main chain as permanent records.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the reason of using a consortium blockchain instead of a public or private one to achieve distributed FL in our proposed MCS learning scenario, it is quite straightforward. On the one hand, either the FL model updates or MCS task related records on the blockchain are not supposed to be unlimitedly available to anyone from the public; on the other hand, blockchain nodes are not authorized by one centralized entity but several predefined members, such as trusted edge servers, and they need to be general and scalable enough to achieve a certain level of decentralization of the blockchain system.
It is worth mentioning that although the blockchain system is mainly introduced here for FL implementation, records on the blockchain are not limited to ML model parameters and updates but also including MCS task related information defined in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="IV-A Task Publication ‣ IV Design of Main Procedures ‣ Blockchain for Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-A</span></span></a>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p4.2" class="ltx_p">Further, with the consortium members maintaining the distributed ledger, there are a lot of consensus protocols applicable to the consortium blockchain, such as PBFT and HotStuff <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. In our proposed system, we adopt PBFT as the consensus protocol in the consortium blockchain since it can improve the efficiency of reaching consensus and reduce time consumption. PBFT is one of the classical consensus protocols in blockchain, and its working process in our proposed blockchain can be described as below: at the beginning, the leader creates a block containing transactions, e.g., the local model updates, and then the leader broadcasts the block to other nodes in the blockchain, i.e., followers; next, all followers conduct the requested service (i.e., verifying the received block) and send back replies to the leader; in the end, if the leader receives <math id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f+1" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">f</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">+</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1"><plus id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.1"></plus><ci id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑓</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p4.1.m1.1c">f+1</annotation></semantics></math> replies from followers with the same result, where <math id="S4.SS3.p4.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p4.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p4.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml">f</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p4.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p4.2.m2.1.1">𝑓</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p4.2.m2.1c">f</annotation></semantics></math> represents the maximum number of faulty nodes allowed, it means consensus has been reached in the blockchain system.
For stability and sustainability of the blockchain system, we consider that all blockchain nodes will receive incentives based on the information recorded on the main chain. In particular, any node generating a valid block will be finally rewarded by the payment from the requestor. This can be achieved due to the following three-aspect reasons: 1) the identity of blockchain node who generates a valid block is clearly indicated on the block; 2) the information records included in the block body can be indexed by the requestor identity or a unique task number assigned when the request is recorded on the blockchain; and 3) the payment settlement with the requestor and the specific reward allocation will be guaranteed by a well-designed scheme which will be introduced in the next section.</p>

This sequential interaction process makes room for malicious requestors rejecting to fully pay the total amount of incentive <math id="S4.SS4.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">W</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑊</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p3.1.m1.1c">W</annotation></semantics></math>. To alleviate this problem, we propose to take advantage of zero-determinant (ZD) game theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to safeguard the interests of all participants in the MCS learning system. Since the leader finalizing the global model works as the last step determining whether the requestor can successfully obtain the final MCS learning result, we consider to deploy the payment enforcement scheme there with a smart contract implementing the detailed strategy. Note that the smart contract is stored on the blockchain as a record so that any blockchian node being the leader can run this program if the finalized global model satisfies the requested model performance.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Considering that the consortium blockchain system for model parameter coordination has limited impact on the FL performance, we conduct the simulation of FL first and focus on investigating the influences of available data size and edge servers’ participation on learning results during the FL process.
To simulate the FL process conducted among edge servers, we utilize a benchmark named LEAF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> to execute federated learning using a 2-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for the FEMNIST dataset with 805,263 samples in total and 3,550 available participants for local computing.
In our experiments, we first change the total data size used for FL indicated by the varying dataset fraction as 0.001, 0.005, and 0.05, with the fixed ratio between training and test dataset sizes as 9:1 and 35 FL participants; and then the number of participates is changed when the total amount of data used for FL keeps constant, where the participant fraction is set as 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05 to approximately simulate the number of participated edge servers as 35, 105, and 175, respectively.

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The learning results under two parameter settings are reported in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-B Blockchain-based Federated Learning at Edge ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Blockchain for Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. It can be seen from the left figure that given the same number of FL participants, the higher the dataset fraction used for FL, the better the learning performance with respect to the testing accuracy.
With too few data samples (blue), the global model cannot even converge after 2,000 rounds of FL.
While from the right figure, one can see with the same amount of data used for FL, the more the participants, the slower to reach convergence. This is reasonable since more participants splitting the total dataset will result in fewer data samples available for each one, leading to the longer training time. Corresponding to the MCS learning scenario, given the fixed amount of mobile devices to collect sensing data, the more edge servers involved, the smaller the local dataset of each edge server, and thus the slower the learning process.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After the edge servers submit the local model updates to the blockchain, blockchain nodes generate a new block to include all updates and the aggregated model, which has to be supported by the predefined consensus protocol. To explore how the blockchain works in our framework, we design experiments to simulate the PBFT consensus process based on the framework in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> as an example. For convenience, we assume that each edge server submit the local model updates with a fixed data size of 300 KB. We implement this set of simulations using Python 3.8.5 in macOS 11.0.1 running on Intel i7 processor with 32 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">First, we explore the relationship between the consensus efficiency in the blockchain system and the number of edge servers as FL clients given 10 nodes in the consortium blockchain. From Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-B Blockchain-based Federated Learning at Edge ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Blockchain for Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we can see that the time cost to reach consensus is linearly correlated to the number of edge servers. This is because increasing the number of edge servers will lead a larger amount of data that need to be packed into blocks, resulting in more time to synchronizing the data on blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Then we examine how the number of blockchain nodes affects the consensus efficiency when the number of FL participants (i.e., edge servers) is 10. The experimental results are shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-B Blockchain-based Federated Learning at Edge ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Blockchain for Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
It is clear that the time consumption increases as the number of blockchain nodes grows. The underline reason is that in the blockchain system running on a peer-to-peer networking structure, more nodes will lead to a larger increase in the communication times among them, and thus making the time consumed for reaching consensus increase near-exponentially.

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.5" class="ltx_p">To figure out whether the proposed ZD-based payment settlement strategy can function effectively, we compare it with other two classical strategies, named tit-for-tat (TFT) and win-stay-lose-shift (WSLS). With the TFT strategy, the leader will choose the action that the requestor adopted in the last round; with the WSLS strategy, the leader keeps performing an action if it brings a high payoff while changes to the other one if it results in a low payoff in the last round.
Besides, we set the initial cooperation probability of the requestor as different values to further indicate the robustness of the proposed scheme. Specifically, we denote the requestor’s initial cooperation probability as <math id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q^{0}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">q</mi><mn id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">0</mn></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑞</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">0</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">q^{0}</annotation></semantics></math> and study the evolution of the requestor’s cooperation probability with respect to <math id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">q</mi><mn id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑞</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">q_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> or <math id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">q</mi><mn id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑞</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p1.3.m3.1c">q_{2}</annotation></semantics></math> according to the action of the leader in the current round.

While the other two classical strategies fail to achieve this job. Further, as presented in four subfigures, no matter how the initial cooperation probability of the requestor changes, the ZD-based scheme can always function successfully with respect to enforcing its full cooperation behavior, i.e., paying the full amount of incentive to the blockchain system. Thus, the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed scheme are validated.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we explore the utilities of both the leader and requestor under the function of the proposed ZD-based scheme. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-C ZD-based Payment Settlement ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Blockchain for Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, we present the utilities at the stable state in the left bar graph and the evolution of utilities in the right-side line graphs. Similar to the previous experiment, we examine the results with different initial cooperation probabilities of the requestor. As can been seen from the left subfigure of Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-C ZD-based Payment Settlement ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Blockchain for Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>,
at the final state with stable strategies of the requestor and the leader, both can obtain similar utility around 6 no matter how cooperative the requestor is at the beginning, which is exactly the utility at the mutual cooperation state. This implies that the proposed scheme is fair with respect to the final utility. From four line figures, one can observe that with different initial cooperation probabilities of the requestor, the dynamic evolution paths of both the leader and the requestor are generally similar with slight difference, where the higher the initial cooperation probability, the faster both sides to achieve the maximized utilities at the stable state. This is consistent with the fact that the more cooperative the requestor, the easier to drive its full cooperation at the stable state.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although MCS has been applied to various fields and brings significant benefits to the whole society, the current MCS paradigm has high requirements on the communication, storage and computing capabilities of requestors, limiting the widespread application of MCS to go a step further. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new MCS learning framework based on the consortium blockchain and the edge-participated FL, functioning among four major entities, i.e., requestors, blockchain, edge servers and mobile devices. Despite existing studies on blockchain for MCS and blockchain-based FL, they fail to lower the requirements on requestors’ capabilities or cannot be directly applied to MCS. Thus, our proposed MCS learning framework fills the gaps with four main procedures, i.e., task publication, data sensing and submission, learning to return final results, and payment settlement and allocation. We design specific schemes in main steps to address challenges resulted from malicious edge servers, dishonest requestors, and even outside attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our designed schemes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our future work, we will make efforts to extensively study the employed blockchain in our proposed MCS learning framework to further improve the efficiency, scalability and reliability; besides, we will also investigate security challenges in blockchain-based distributed learning during the model training process, which may benefit not only our proposed MCS learning system but also other applications involving extensive data collection and analysis.</p>
