<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for collaboratively training a shared machine learning model across distributed datasets/clients in a privacy-preserving manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Shared, global models learned through FL can (potentially) outperform standalone models (those trained individually by each client in the absence of collaboration), owing to their ability to effectively aggregate knowledge from diverse clients. Popular FL algorithms such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> have been found to perform well, particularly when clients have independent and identically distributed (iid) datasets. However, real-world applications often involve heterogeneous datasets across clients, a situation where the performance of FedAvg can considerably deteriorate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>)</cite>. Moreover, the standard FL approach yields a single global model, lacking customization for each client. Consequently, clients with heterogeneous datasets may experience low local accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Tan et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. To address these limitations, a spectrum of <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">personalized FL</em> techniques has been proposed, to enhance the local accuracy of the learned models, while keeping some of the benefits of collaborative learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to handling issues of data heterogeneity, training FL models that can uphold societal values, as formalized through notions of <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">algorithmic (group) fairness</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Barocas et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, is an important consideration.
Consider as an example the scenario where FL is used to train a foundation model/LLM on local datasets, contributed by diverse participants from different regions and communities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kuang et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. Without careful oversight, the resulting model will favor language and content preferred by the majority contributors, often disregarding the unique linguistic nuances and cultural contexts of minority groups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Durmus et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. As another example, existing research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kirdemir et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> finds structural and systemic bias in YouTube video recommendation systems. In this case, the collaboratively trained recommendation model begins to favor certain perspectives over others, inadvertently reinforcing biases present in the data. As a result, users are fed information that perpetuates stereotypes, causing harm to underrepresented communities. These examples motivate the development of FL algorithms that can meet certain fairness criteria.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we establish an alignment between these two considerations in the developing FL algorithms: <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">personalization can also improve fairness</em>. That is, we show that personalization techniques (which are designed to improve the local accuracy of the learned models) can also enhance algorithmic fairness (i.e., they can reduce the disparities in how the resulting model treats individuals from different protected groups, once the model is deployed by the client).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We begin by illustrating this alignment between personalization and fairness through numerical experiments comparing the average local fairness achieved by two personalized FL algorithms, <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Clustered-FL</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ghosh et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">MAML-FL</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fallah et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, against <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</em> and <em id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">standalone</em> learning (where each client learns by itself, and there is no collaboration), under three notions of fairness (Statistical Parity, Equality of Opportunity and Equalized Odds), and using both synthetic and real-world data (different prediction tasks in the “Retiring Adult” dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ding et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>). Based on these experiments, we highlight two potential factors driving the alignment:
<br class="ltx_break">      1. <em id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Statistical</em> advantages of diverse data. Collaborative learning algorithms in essence have access to more “information” (data) from diverse clients. They can therefore enhance both accuracy and fairness, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as in these scenarios issues of algorithmic unfairness can be attributed to the under-representation of samples from the disadvantaged group in the data. Further, personalized algorithms can outperform non-personalized collaborative learning (e.g. FedAvg), as (we posit) they are less prone to overfitting to the majority group’s data.
<br class="ltx_break">      2. <em id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Computational</em> advantages due to alignments in local accuracy and fairness. Moreover, we identify cases where the sample distribution within clients is such that improving accuracy also promotes fairness. More intuitively, consider the concept of clustered FL, a personalized FL technique, where clients are organized into groups based on similarities in model performance (a proxy for data similarities). We argue that this clustering can be seen as a means to foster a model that is both more precise and more equitable, as it effectively treats information originating from other clusters as noise, which, if left unaddressed, would have led to model divergence, potentially compromising both cluster-specific performance and fairness. Building on this intuition, we also provide analytical support of the alignment between personalization and fairness (Propositions <a href="#Thmprop1" title="Proposition 1 (Improved EqOp through clustering). ‣ 5 Personalization can also improve fairness: theoretical support ‣ Enhancing Group Fairness in Federated Learning through Personalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and <a href="#Thmprop2" title="Proposition 2 (Improved SP through clustering). ‣ 5 Personalization can also improve fairness: theoretical support ‣ Enhancing Group Fairness in Federated Learning through Personalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to identify the (unintended) fairness benefits of personalization techniques in FL. Most existing works primarily focus on refining algorithms to attain either improved local accuracy (the personalized FL literature), <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">or</em>, enhanced (global) fairness (the fair FL literature); we discuss related work from each direction in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Related works ‣ Enhancing Group Fairness in Federated Learning through Personalization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. In contrast, our work examines the influence of existing personalization techniques on (local) fairness, and points to inherent features of collaborative learning and personalization that can advance fairness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, prior work points to the challenge of balancing the trade-off between fairness and accuracy of an algorithm, as enhancing fairness often comes at the cost of accuracy degradation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gu et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Ezzeldin et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Chien &amp; Danks, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. In contrast, we identify instances that FL in general, and personalized FL in particular, can improve <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">both</em> accuracy and fairness compared to standalone learning. Furthermore, inspired by our findings, we propose a new, Fairness-aware Federated Clustering Algorithm, <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Fair-FCA</span>. Our algorithm is an extension of the Clustered-FL (<span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">IFCA</span>) algorithm of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ghosh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, by modifying the cluster identity assignment step to encompass a fairness criterion. Given our finding that personalization can offer dual benefits, we find that this modification can be used to strike a better balance between accuracy and fairness at the client level.</p>

The server then aggregates all the received local models (through a weighted sum) to create the new global model for the next round. While FedAvg can successfully learn a global model, if the clients are heterogeneous, the local loss of the shared global model may be high locally for each client. This has motivated the development of personalized FL algorithms, two types of which we consider in this work: clustering and local fine-tuning. The Clustered-FL algorithm of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ghosh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> alternates between two steps: clustering/grouping clients based on model performance, and optimizing model parameters via gradient descent in each cluster separately, leading to distinct, <em id="S3.p4.5.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cluster-specific models</em>. Similarly, the MAML-FL algorithm of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fallah et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> takes an extra step beyond the FedAvg approach. In it, clients <em id="S3.p4.5.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fine-tune</em> the received global model by running additional gradient steps on it locally, to specialize it to their local data and reduce their local loss.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have shown, both numerically and analytically, that there can be (unintended) fairness benefits to personalization in Federated Learning. We have identified potential statistical reasons (improved data diversity) and computational reasons (alignments between local accuracy and fairness while preventing overfitting) for this alignment. Motivated by these findings, we further proposed a Fairness-aware Federated Clustering Algorithm (<span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Fair-FCA</span>), which takes both the fairness and model performance into account when clustering clients. We find that this modification can lead to an improved fairness-accuracy tradeoff, (partly) as personalization technique offer dual benefits in terms of accuracy and fairness. Experiments under other types of personalized FL algorithms (beyond clustering and local fine-tuning), and extending our analytical findings (both for clustered FL algorithms, and to other classes of personalized FL methods) are main directions of future work.</p>

The idea is that the clients with higher loss will be assigned a higher weight so as to encourage more uniform accuracy across clients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> further extend this by considering robustness and poisoning attacks; here, performance fairness and robustness are achieved through a personalized FL method.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> aim to achieve small disparity in accuracy across the groups of client-wise, attribute-wise, and potential clients with agnostic distribution, simultaneously. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> discuss the (performance) unfairness caused by conflicting gradients. They detect this conflict through the notion of cosine similarity, and iteratively eliminate it before aggregation by modifying the direction and magnitude of the gradients.
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="A2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Good-Intent fairness:</span> The good-intent fairness aims to minimize the maximum loss for the protected group. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Mohri et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> propose a new framework of agnostic FL to mitigate the bias in the training procedure via minimax optimization. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Cui et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> consider a constrained multi-objective optimization problem to enforce the fairness constraint on all clients.

(<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> show that a model that is minimax fair w.r.t. clients is equivalent to a relaxed minimax fair model w.r.t. demographic group. They also show their proposed algorithm leads to the same minimax group fairness performance guarantee as the centralized approaches.
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="A2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Other types of fairness:</span> There are also other types of fairness considered in the FL literature. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Huang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> studied the unfairness caused by the heterogeneous nature of FL, which leads to the possibility of preference for certain clients in the training process. They propose an optimization algorithm combined with a double momentum gradient and weighting strategy to create a fairer and more accurate model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Chu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> measure fairness as the absolute loss difference between protected groups and labels, a variant of equality opportunity fairness constraint. They propose an estimation method to accurately measure fairness without violating data privacy and incorporate fairness as a constraint to achieve a fairer model with high accuracy performance. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> study a new notion of fairness, proportional fairness, in FL, which is based on the relative change of each client’s performance. They connect with the Nash bargaining solution in the cooperative gaming theory and maximize the product of client utilities, where the total relative utility cannot be improved. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Lyu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> study collaborative fairness, meaning that a client who has a higher contribution to learning should be rewarded with a better-performing local model. They introduce a collaborative fair FL framework that incorporates with reputation mechanism to enforce clients with different contributions converge to different models. Their approach could also be viewed as a variant of clustering that separates clients based on their contributions.</p>

In this package, there are three tasks: ACSEmployment, ACSIncome, and ACSHealth. For the ACSEmployemnt task, the goal is to predict whether the person is employed based on its multi-dimensional features; for the ACSIncome task, the goal is to predict whether the person earns more than $50,000 annually; and for the ACSHealth task, the goal is to predict whether the person is covered by insurance.</p>

For all tasks, we use the RELU activation function and a batch size of 32. Furthermore, we utilize the SGD optimizer for training, with a learning rate of 0.001 for both FedAvg and MAML algorithms and 0.05 for the clustered FL algorithm. In FL, each client updates the global model for 10 epochs in the FedAvg and MAML algorithms and sends it back to the server, while the clustered FL algorithm that has a larger learning rate updates the global model for 1 epoch. We also follow the encoding procedure for categorical features provided by the folktables Python package. The input feature size is 54, 109 and 154 for the ACSIncome, ACSEmployment and ACSHealth tasks, respectively. In the experiments, we consider either sex (e.g., male and female) or race (e.g., White and Non-White) as the protected attribute.</p>
