<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Face verification has come into increasing focus in various applications including the European Entry/Exit System, which integrates face recognition mechanisms. At the same time, the rapid advancement of biometric authentication requires extensive performance tests in order to inhibit the discriminatory treatment of travellers due to their demographic background. However, the use of face images collected as part of border controls is restricted by the European General Data Protection Law to be processed for no other reason than its original purpose. Therefore, this paper investigates the suitability of synthetic face images generated with StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 to compensate for the urgent lack of publicly available large-scale test data. Specifically, two deep learning-based (SER-FIQ, FaceQnet v1) and one standard-based (ISO/IEC TR 29794-5) face image quality assessment algorithm is utilized to compare the applicability of synthetic face images compared to real face images extracted from the FRGC dataset. Finally, based on the analysis of impostor score distributions and utility score distributions, our experiments reveal negligible differences between StyleGAN vs. StyleGAN2, and further also minor discrepancies compared to real face images.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Biometric verification refers to the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioural characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Among multiple biometric characteristics, face has gained popularity in various application scenarios, such as border control systems like the European Entry-Exit System (EES) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, passport issuance and civilian ID management. Human face as a biometric modality has proven to be sufficiently unique to allow individual recognition with reasonable inter-class distance. Driven by the factors such as user convenience and good biometric performance (i.e., both identification and verification), the Smart Borders program under EES initiative has identified face as a mandatory biometric data. The EES system will be deployed as a central system for collecting and querying traveller data including face data to the Schengen area at all border crossing points<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The deployment of biometric recognition at the European borders requires the biometric performance to comply with high standards defined in the best practices for automated border control of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. While the value of real and sufficiently representative biometric data for biometric performance tests is obvious, it is becoming more and more important that the business can reasonably consider also alternative options such as the
generation and use of synthetic biometric data samples, ensuring comparable characteristics and representativeness to real data. However, generating synthetic face images with similar properties to real face images captured
at border control scenarios (e.g. frontal head poses without
face occlusions) continues to be a technical challenge.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In an attempt to answer this question, this work analyses the differences between synthetically generated face images and real face images from the biometric perspective. Although biometric performance reporting can be a way to assess the applicability of the synthetically generated data, the random generation procedure often produces limited true-mated pairs. Reporting the verification performance on synthetically generated dataset is therefore not realistic. Among other approaches for conducting such an analysis, we choose to assess the quality of the face images reflecting regular biometric systems where quality is first determined before using it for any biometric purpose. Face Quality Assessment Algorithms (FQAA) quantify the biometric quality of a sample (for instance, face image) by translating it to a quality score between [0, 100] <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. A high quality score indicates that the corresponding biometric sample is well suited for biometric recognition and a low quality score leads to inaccurate results due to the low quality of the input image. This understanding of biometric quality complies with the terminology of ISO/IEC 29794-1 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which defines the utility of a biometric sample as the prediction of the biometric recognition accuracy. In general, FQAAs are either aiming to predict the utility of face images for a specific face recognition model or alternatively try to establish a general utility predictor that can be used for an arbitrary face recognition system. In this context, Terhörst et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduced a model-specific FQAA, based on the stochastic embedding robustness (”SER-FIQ”) of quality features extracted with ArcFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The comparison of the authors against previous state-of-the-art FQAA approaches showed that SER-FIQ significantly outperformed alternative methods. Recently, Hernandez-Ortega <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> presented FaceQnet v1, a general FQAA, the performance of which was benchmarked in the ongoing quality assessment evaluation of the National Institute of Standards and Quality (NIST) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, despite state-of-the-art performances of SER-FIQ and FaceQnet v1, the utility predictions of both algorithms are not explainable. For this reason, face image quality features based on a technical report of international standardisation bodies, such as ISO/IEC TR 29794-5 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, can be utilized to manually construct a more explainable FQAA, as proposed by Wasnik et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> (see FFigure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-B Comparison between Synthetic and Real Data ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ On the Applicability of Synthetic Data for Face Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">By measuring the face quality metrics of synthetically generated face samples, we can establish if they can be used for biometric algorithm training and testing purposes. In order to assert and evaluate our hypothesis, we conduct an extensive analysis of three different quality metrics such as ISO/IEC TR 29794-5 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and two deep learning based quality metrics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> on face images generated using StyleGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and StyleGAN2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> respectively. StyleGAN2 emphasizes the capability of the new architecture to generate higher quality face images by removing water droplet-like artefacts caused by StyleGAN. However, the question of whether StyleGAN2 images are more suitable for face recognition compared to StyleGAN images has not yet been addressed. Therefore, this paper also includes a comparison between StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 based on recent face image quality assessment algorithms (FQAAs). Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ On the Applicability of Synthetic Data for Face Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> illustrates the quality scores obtained on face images from different datasets. As noted from Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ On the Applicability of Synthetic Data for Face Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, various FQAAs indicate different face image quality score. Noting that they are inconsistent in providing similar scores, we evaluate the synthetically generated face images using all three FQAAs to assess the usability of such images in biometrics from different complementary perspectives.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The main contribution of this paper is in investigating and reporting to which extent the synthetic samples could replace the need for real images for conducting biometric performance tests of a pre-trained face recognition system. More specifically, the goal is to obtain synthetic face images that are similar to real face images not only from the human perception point, but also in the context of face recognition. In this paper, the differences between synthetic and real face images in terms of their utility are evaluated by measuring the quality with two deep learning based FQAAs: FaceQnet v1 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and SER-FIQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

StyleGAN applies latent space mapping and adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) to control the image synthesis process by styles, which finally leads to the unsupervised separation of high-level attributes. In addition to their proposed GAN architecture, the authors webcrawled high-quality human face images from a social media platform (Flickr) in order to create a new dataset (FFHQ), which covers a wide variation of soft biometrics (e.g. ethnicity, gender). Extending the work of StyleGAN, Karras et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> further published the state-of-the-art model StyleGAN2, where they improved the architectural design and fixed the characteristic artefacts occurring in the synthetic images generated by StyleGAN.</p>

To avoid such an adverse effect and mitigate images of unwanted visual appearance, we apply a truncation factor on the latent space of both StyleGAN and StyleGAN2.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Terhörst et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduced an estimation method for predicting the face image quality based on stochastic embedding robustness (SER-FIQ). SER-FIQ is an unsupervised technique that is not dependent on previously extracted ground truths in order to train the prediction model. Compared to FaceQnet v1, which outputs the general utility of a face image, SER-FIQ focuses on predicting the utility of a specific face recognition system. More precisely, the quality scores are based on the variations of face embeddings stemming from random subnetworks of a face recognition model. The authors argue that a high variation between the embeddings of the same sample functions as a robustness indication, which is assumed to be synonymous with image quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since the face embeddings extracted with face recognition systems are deterministic, the main idea of SER-FIQ is to add dropout layers as additional components to create random subnetworks for each prediction of the same sample. Once a fixed number of stochastic embeddings are extracted, the sigmoid of the negative mean euclidean distances between all embedding pairs is computed and outputs a quality score. However, the computational complexity of SER-FIQ increases quadratically with the number of random subnetworks, which leads to a trade-off between the efficiency of the algorithm and the expected accuracy of the quality predictions. Following the recommendation of the authors, all experiments in this report are conducted with a number of N=100 subnetworks.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to compare the utility of face images from different datasets, impostor distributions of comparison scores are created to evaluate differences in the similarity among non-mated face images. The impostor distribution can show the diversity of identity in each dataset and also can evaluate its verification performance on FRS, in the circumstance that our synthetic data is randomly generated without any mated samples. In the impostor distribution, 5,000 random pairs are randomly sampled from the dataset and the cosine similarities between their embeddings extracted with Arcface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> are calculated. Then, comparison scores of each dataset are converted to histograms and fitted to a Gaussian distribution using kernel density estimation. As a reference, the threshold=0.25 of the applied Arcface model is set at False Match Rate (FMR) = 0.1% on LFW dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> following the guidelines of Frontex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

This also fits our original understanding of the truncation that it shrinks the sampling region of the latent space so the generated facial images will have less variation of conditions.

The huge difference can be explained by the way the data samples were acquired: StyleGAN2 is trained on the FFHQ dataset, which has been webcrawled from a social media platform (Flickr). On the other hand, the images contained in FRGC were physically captured to use them for face recognition testing. Therefore, the variability of the StyleGAN2 images is much higher compared to those included in FRGC. In the same context, the number of filtered out images due to extreme pose rotations turns out to be much lower for FRGC in contrast to StyleGAN2 images.</p>

In other words, the similarity scores of non-mated comparisons are slightly higher compared to those of FRGC, which potentially causes higher False-Match-Rates. Nevertheless, the minor differences might also be due to random effects rooted in the data acquisition process.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To further evaluate the discrepancies between StyleGAN2 and FRGC, Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-B Comparison between Synthetic and Real Data ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ On the Applicability of Synthetic Data for Face Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> depicts the quality score distributions for different FQAAs. Looking at the FaceQnet v1 distributions, both areas are nearly identical with a very low Kullback Leibler Divergence of 0.111. However, steering the focus on the SER-FIQ distributions, a clear shift in the peaks is notable, which reveals that the estimated utility of the synthetic images is lower compared to FRGC images. This behavior corresponds to our expectations as the variety of pose rotations is much higher within the StyleGAN2 images and the authors highlight the sensitivity of their approach to this kind of deviation.</p>

At first glance, the blurriness score stands out, which indicates a significant difference between the real and synthetic datasets. A deeper look at the two distributions in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-B Comparison between Synthetic and Real Data ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ On the Applicability of Synthetic Data for Face Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(b) reveals that several FRGC images are annotated with high blurriness scores, which manifests itself in a bimodal distribution. The reason for this observation is due to the capturing process, where the images of multiple subjects were captured in motion.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To investigate the suitability of synthetically generated face images for biometric recognition, we evaluated the face quality of synthetic face images generated by StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 and also compared to real face images from the FRGC dataset which represents the quality of images in border control. The comparison of the utility between different datasets is based on histograms of non-mated comparison scores with Arcface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and histograms of quality scores with 3 different representative face quality algorithms, including the state-of-the-art SER-FIQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The first part of our experiments focuses on the comparison between different synthetic face datasets. The evaluation result of comparing synthetic face data generated by StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 shows that their utility for biometric recognition is similar. In this context, both the impostor comparison scores and the quality scores are consistent in their results and indicate that as the truncation factor increases, the differences vanish. By comparing various truncation factors, it is also demonstrated that while the image quality increases with smaller truncation values, the variety of the generated face images decreases at the same time. In other words, a low truncation factor leads to face images with similar identities and is therefore not suitable for biometric performance in border control scenarios, such as the EES.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second part of the experiments is focusing on the comparison between the synthetic and real face images. The impostor distribution of synthetic data is slightly offset to the right, which means that the similarity between non-mated samples is slightly higher compared to real face images. The analysis of the FaceQnet v1 quality scores has not revealed any major differences between images stemming from StyleGAN2 or FRGC. However, the comparison of the SER-FIQ quality scores revealed a minor drop in quality for synthetic face images, which can be explained by the wider range of pose rotations. Further, the assessment of the ISO/IEC TR 29794-5:2010 features has shown a high blurriness score for FRGC images, caused by capturing some face images in motion. Finally, we conclude that StyleGAN2 and FRGC images have shown the minor differences in face quality, which means the evaluated synthetic data can achieve a similar quality as biometric samples in EES cases and allows us to exploit both domains for realistic biometric performance tests.</p>
