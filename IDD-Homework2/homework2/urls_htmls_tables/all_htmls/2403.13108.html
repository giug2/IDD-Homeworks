<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">We scrutinize the resilience of the partial-sharing online federated learning (PSO-Fed) algorithm against model-poisoning attacks. PSO-Fed reduces the communication load by enabling clients to exchange only a fraction of their model estimates with the server at each update round. Partial sharing of model estimates also enhances the robustness of the algorithm against model-poisoning attacks. To gain better insights into this phenomenon, we analyze the performance of the PSO-Fed algorithm in the presence of Byzantine clients, malicious actors who may subtly tamper with their local models by adding noise before sharing them with the server. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that PSO-Fed maintains convergence in both mean and mean-square senses, even under the strain of model-poisoning attacks. We further derive the theoretical mean square error (MSE) of PSO-Fed, linking it to various parameters such as stepsize, attack probability, number of Byzantine clients, client participation rate, partial-sharing ratio, and noise variance. We also show that there is a non-trivial optimal stepsize for PSO-Fed when faced with model-poisoning attacks. The results of our extensive numerical experiments affirm our theoretical assertions and highlight the superior ability of PSO-Fed to counteract Byzantine attacks, outperforming other related leading algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a distributed learning paradigm that enables a network of devices, such as smartphones, internet of things (IoT) nodes, and media streamers, to jointly learn a global model without the need to directly disclose their local raw data to the server or other devices. FL is particularly beneficial when data is distributed across numerous devices, and conducting centralized training by transferring the data to the server is unfeasible or impractical <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
FL exhibits two key features: the ability to handle heterogeneous data, such as non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) or unbalanced data, and the ability to run on heterogeneous devices that may have limited resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The communication load in FL refers to the volume of data transmitted between the central server and participating devices during training. It can affect the efficiency and scalability of FL in real-world applications as excessive data transmission may escalate resource usage and the cost associated with training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Several algorithms have been proposed to alleviate the communication load in FL.
Among them, sign stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> utilizes sign-based gradient compressors to lower the communication and computational costs of FL. Compressive sensing FL (CS-Fed) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> reduces the communication load using <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">1</annotation></semantics></math>-bit compressive sensing in analog aggregation transmissions. Quantile sketch FL (QS-Fed) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> improves communication efficiency by compressing model updates using a count sketch. Online-Fed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> enhances communication efficiency by engaging only a randomly selected subset of clients to communicate with the server in each iteration. However, the aforementioned works do not consider the potential presence of adversaries within the network who may seek to undermine the learning process. This can be through tampering with message exchanges or intentionally providing corrupted or incorrect information. Factoring in the possibility of malicious clients in the network is an important aspect of developing reliable and robust FL algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In network environments, Byzantine clients are those that act unpredictably or with malicious intent. Such clients can disrupt normal operations by sending misleading information or not following established protocols. This behavior poses significant risks to the FL process, potentially leading to disruption or degraded performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Byzantine clients can jeopardize the integrity and reliability of the global model in FL. They may engage in deceptive practices, such as submitting false or inconsistent gradients or model weights during updates, or even initiating denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, all of which can compromise the integrity and effectiveness of the FL process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
To mitigate the impact of Byzantine clients in FL, various strategies have been proposed. These include the use of robust aggregate statistics, the assignment of trust scores to individual clients, and the utilization of historical information to recover from Byzantine attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Byzantine clients may launch a wide range of adversarial attacks such as data-poisoning, model-poisoning, and label-poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Data-poisoning attacks involve the injection of malicious data into the training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Evasion attacks involve manipulating input data to undermine the generalizability of the learned model while evading detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Backdoor attacks involve embedding hidden trigger mechanisms within the model that can induce targeted malicious behavior <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Inference-time attacks, such as membership inference, aim to uncover whether a specific data point has been used in training, raising privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Attacks can also target network infrastructure, such as distributed DoS attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks, disrupting services or intercepting communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Model-poisoning attacks, where Byzantine clients manipulate model updates during training, are prominent examples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Defense strategies against model-poisoning attacks in FL are reviewed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, categorized into evaluation methods for local model updates and aggregation methods for the global model. In evaluation methods, the server examines client submissions without having access to local client data, which poses challenges to their applicability. In aggregation methods, the server adjusts the local model updates based on certain criteria or utilizes relevant statistical methods. Robust aggregation techniques using median or trimmed mean can mitigate the impact of malicious clients on the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Blockchain-assisted aggregation schemes can also help cope with network attacks but often incur high communication load or computational complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">A SignSGD-based communication-efficient FL algorithm has recently been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> that exhibits resilience to Byzantine attacks. However, it assumes the consistent participation of all clients in every FL iteration, which may not align with the practical realities of FL, particularly in scenarios where clients (such as mobile or IoT devices) have limited resources in terms of energy or computational capacity. Therefore, there is a notable gap in the current FL research: the need for communication-efficient FL algorithms that are robust against model-poisoning attacks without imposing additional computational burden on clients. Addressing this gap can make FL more accessible and practical for a wider range of devices, especially those with constrained resources, and enhance the robustness and scalability of FL systems in real-world applications.</p>

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we analyze the performance of the partial-sharing online FL (PSO-Fed) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, particularly in the face of Byzantine attacks. Our analysis reveals that partial sharing in online FL, while primarily aimed at enhancing communication efficiency, also offers the added advantage of mitigating the adverse effects of model-poisoning attacks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that PSO-Fed can converge in both mean and mean-square senses, even when subjected to model-poisoning attacks. In addition, we derive the theoretical steady-state mean square error (MSE) of PSO-Fed. A key finding of our analysis is the identification of a non-trivial optimal stepsize for PSO-Fed under model-poisoning attacks. Contrary to the common behavior of stochastic gradient descent algorithms where a smaller stepsize often results in enhanced performance, in the case of PSO-Fed under model-poisoning attacks, a smaller stepsize does not automatically equate to better estimation accuracy. This is a departure from the norm observed in gradient-descent-based algorithms, where smaller stepsizes are commonly used to enhance performance, often at the cost of a slower convergence rate. We provide a theoretical calculation of the optimal stepsize. To validate our theoretical insights, we conduct extensive numerical experiments using synthetic non-IID data. The experimental outcomes confirm our theoretical predictions and show that PSO-Fed exhibits greater resilience to Byzantine attacks compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, including Online-FL, all while avoiding any additional computational overhead.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conducted a theoretical analysis of the recently proposed PSO-Fed algorithm to examine its resilience to model-poisoning (Byzantine) attacks imparted by partial sharing. In our analysis, we considered a linear regression task with the local objective function of each client defined as an empirical risk. We showed that, even under Byzantine attacks, PSO-Fed converges in both mean and mean-square senses, given an appropriate choice of stepsize. More importantly, we showed that, in the presence of Byzantine clients, the steady-state MSE of PSO-Fed is significantly smaller than that of the Online-Fed algorithm, which does not feature partial sharing. Our theoretical analysis also uncovered the existence of a non-trivial optimal stepsize for PSO-Fed in the presence of model-poisoning attacks
The simulation results corroborated our theoretical findings regarding PSO-Fed’s effectiveness against Byzantine attacks as well as the accuracy of the theoretically predicted values of its steady-state MSE and optimal stepsize.</p>
