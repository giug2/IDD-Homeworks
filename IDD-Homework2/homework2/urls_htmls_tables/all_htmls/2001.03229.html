<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Many IoT applications at the network edge demand intelligent decisions in a real-time manner.
The edge device alone, however, often cannot achieve real-time edge intelligence due to its constrained computing resources and limited local data.
To tackle these challenges, we propose a platform-aided collaborative learning framework where a model is first trained across a set of source edge nodes by a federated meta-learning approach, and then it is rapidly adapted to learn a new task at the target edge node, using a few samples only.
Further, we investigate the convergence of the proposed federated meta-learning algorithm under mild conditions on node similarity and the adaptation performance at the target edge.
To combat against the vulnerability of meta-learning algorithms to possible adversarial attacks, we further propose a robust version of the federated meta-learning algorithm based on distributionally robust optimization, and establish its convergence under mild conditions. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Federated Meta-Learning based framework.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since most of IoT devices reside at the network edge, pushing the AI frontier to achieve real-time edge intelligence is highly nontrivial, due to the requirements in performance, cost and privacy. Clearly, the conventional wisdom of transporting
the data bulks from the IoT devices to the cloud datacenters for analytics would not work well, simply because the requirements in terms of high bandwidth and low latency would be extremely demanding and stringent. As a result, it is anticipated that a high percentage of IoT data will be stored and processed locally. However,
running AI applications directly on edge devices to process the IoT data locally, if not designed intelligently, would suffer from
poor performance and energy inefficiency, simply because many AI applications typically require high computational power that greatly
outweighs the capacity of resource- and energy-constrained IoT devices.
To address the above challenges, edge computing has recently emerged, and the marriage of edge computing and AI has given rise to a new research area, namely ‘edge intelligence’ or ‘edge AI’ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is highly challenging for a single edge node alone to achieve real-time edge intelligence.
A key observation is that learning tasks across edge nodes often share some similarity, which can be leveraged to tackle these challenges. With this insight, we propose a platform-aided collaborative learning framework where the model knowledge is learnt collaboratively by a federation of edge nodes, in a distributed manner, and then is transferred via the platform to the target edge node for fine-tuning with its local dataset. Then, the next key question to ask is <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“What knowledge should the federation of edge nodes learn and be transferred to the target edge node for achieving real-time edge intelligence?”</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has recently been developed for model training across multiple edge nodes, where a single global model is trained across all edge nodes in a distributed manner. It has been shown that limited performance is achieved when fine-tuning the global model for adaptation to a new (target) edge node with a small dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Along a different line, federated multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has been proposed to train different but related models for different nodes, aiming to deal with the model heterogeneity among edge nodes. In particular, every source edge node, which is also a target edge node, is able to learn a unique model through capitalizing the computational resource and data belonging to other nodes. This, however, inevitably requires intensive computation and communications and is time-consuming, and hence could not meet the latency requirement for real-time edge intelligence.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Building on the recent exciting advances in meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, in this paper we propose a federated meta-learning approach to address the questions mentioned above.
The underlying rationale behind meta-learning is to train the model’s
initial parameters over many tasks, such that the pre-trained model can achieve maximal performance
on a new task after quick adaptation using only
a small amount of data corresponding to that new task.
Thus inspired, we advocate a federated meta-learning approach where all source edge nodes collaboratively learn a global model initialization such that maximal performance can be obtained with the model parameters updated with only a few data samples at the target edge node, thereby achieving real-time edge intelligence.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Different from meta-learning which requires the knowledge of the task distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, the federated meta-learning proposed in this work removes this assumption, by making use of the fact that different edge nodes often have distinct local models while sharing some similarity, and it can automate the process of task construction because each edge node is continuously making intelligent decisions.
Further, the federated meta-learning eliminates the need of centralized computation and thus offers the flexibility to strike a good balance between the communication cost and local computation cost (e.g., via controlling the number of local update steps).</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of meta-learning is not new, but the recent advances through gradient-based optimization bring it into the light again as a promising solution for fast learning.
In particular, Finn et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> propose one gradient-based algorithm called MAML, which directly optimizes the learning performance with respect to an initialization of the model such that even one-step gradient descent from that initialization can still produce good results on a new task.
To circumvent the need of the second derivatives in MAML, Nichol et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> propose a first-order method named Reptile, which is similar to joint training but surprisingly works well as a meta-learning algorithm.
A similar meta-learning framework is studied by Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> for recommendation systems through assigning one task to every user, which nevertheless does not consider any system modeling in federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to establish the convergence of (federated) meta-learning. During the preparation of this work, the preprint of one concurrent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> about convergence analysis of meta-learning algorithms became available online. It is worth noting that <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> studies the convergence of centralized MAML algorithms for non-convex functions, whereas this paper focuses on the convergence and adaptation performance of the federated meta-learning algorithm with node similarity to achieve real-time edge intelligence in a federated setting, where multiple local update steps are allowed to balance the trade-off between the communication cost and local computation cost.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The susceptibility of meta-learning algorithms such as MAML to adversarial attacks is first investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. And recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> also demonstrates the significant performance degradation of MAML with adversarial samples. To make meta-learning more robust, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposes a meta-learning algorithm called ADML which exploits both clean and adversarial samples to push the inner gradient update to arm-wrestle with the meta-update. Unfortunately, this type of approaches are generally intractable. The DRO-based robust federated meta-learning algorithm proposed in this work is not only computationally tractable, but also resistant to more general perturbations, e.g., out-of-distribution samples. In addition, the trade-off between robustness and accuracy can be fine-tuned by the size of the distributional uncertainty set.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is first proposed by Mcmahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> which performs a variable number of local updates on a subset of devices to enable flexible and efficient communication patterns but without any theoretical convergence guarantee. Based on this, Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> analyze the convergence with fixed number of local updates for non-independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) data distributions across devices, and introduce a control algorithm to dynamically adapt the frequency of global aggregation to minimize the loss under fixed resource constraints. Departing from the need of manually tuning the number of local updates, Sahu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> propose a more generalized algorithm, so called FedProx, to tackle the statistical heterogeneity inherent in federated learning and characterize the convergence behaviour for non-convex loss functions. Notwithstanding, federated learning is not designed for fast learning with small datasets. In particular, federated learning intends to find a global model that fits the data as accurately as possible for all participating nodes, wheras federated meta-learning learns a model initialization, from which fast adaptation from even small datasets can still reach good performance, and also keeps the node heterogeneity in the sense that different models would be learnt for different nodes after quick adaptation from the global model initialization.</p>

<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Both meta-learning and multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> aim to improve the learning performance by leveraging other related tasks. However, meta-learning focuses on the fast learning ability with small sample sizes and the performance improvement at the target (learning at the source is irrelevant), whereas multi-task learning aims to learn both the source and target tasks simultaneously and accurately. Besides, the model initialization learned by meta-learning can be fine-tuned with good performance on various target tasks using minimal data points, while multi-task learning may favor tasks with significantly larger amount of samples than others.</p>

Intuitively, by considering how the test error on local testing datasets changes with respect to the updated model parameters, we aim to obtain a model initialization such that small changes in the model parameters, i.e., altering in the direction of the loss gradient, would lead to substantial performance improvements for any task across the edge nodes.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Assumptions 1-2 are standard and hold in many machine learning applications, e.g., in logistic regression over a bounded domain and squared-SVM. Assumption 3 is concerned with the high-order smoothness of the local loss function at each edge node, which makes it possible to characterize the landscape of the local meta-learning objective function. Assumption 4 is imposed to capture the node similarity. Specifically, we impose the condition that the variations of the gradients and Hessians of local loss functions (with respect to the hyper-parameter) across edge nodes are upper bounded by some constant.
Intuitively, a small (large) constant indicates that the tasks are more (less) similar, and this constant can be tuned over a wide range to obtain a general understanding.
Further, for a task distribution with task gradients uniformly bounded above (as is standard), Assumption 4 follows directly because <math id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\|\nabla L_{i}(\boldsymbol{\theta})-\nabla L_{w}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\|" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.1.cmml">‖</mo><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mo rspace="0.167em" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.1.cmml">∇</mo><msub id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.2.cmml">L</mi><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub></mrow><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝜽</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.cmml"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.cmml"><mo rspace="0.167em" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.1.cmml">∇</mo><msub id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.2.cmml">L</mi><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.3.cmml">w</mi></msub></mrow><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml">𝜽</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.1.cmml">‖</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.2">norm</csymbol><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1"><minus id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1"></minus><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2"><times id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.1"></times><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2"><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.1">∇</ci><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.2">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.2.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝜽</ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3"><times id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.1"></times><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2"><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.1">∇</ci><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.2">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3.3.1.1.3.2.2.3">𝑤</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.2.2">𝜽</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p2.1.m1.3c">\|\nabla L_{i}(\boldsymbol{\theta})-\nabla L_{w}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\|</annotation></semantics></math> (also Hessian) can be viewed as the distance between a typical realization and the sample average.

Further, as outlined in Algorithm 2, through pre-training each edge node to learn to protect against adversarial perturbations on the testing dataset while securing the model accuracy on clean data with Algorithm 2, the learned model via meta-training automatically gains the ability to prevent future adversarial attacks without significantly sacrificing the learning accuracy with quick adaptation at the target edge node.</p>

We study a convex classification problem with MNIST using multinomial logistic regression. Next, we consider a more complicated classification problem on Sent140 by taking each twitter account as a node, where the model takes a sequence of 25 characters as input, embeds each of the character into a 300 dimensional space by looking up the pretrained 300D GloVe embedding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and outputs one character per training sample through a network with 3 hidden layers with sizes 256, 128, 64, each including batch normalization and ReLU nonlinearities, followed by a linear layer and softmax. The loss function is the cross-entropy error between the predicted and true class for all models.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fast adaptation performance.</span> As shown in Figure 3(b), FedML achieves the best adaptation performance on Synthetic(0,0) where the nodes are the most similar. We also compare the fast adaptation performance between FedML and Fedavg on three different datasets, Synthetic(0.5,0.5), MNIST and Sent140. As shown in Figure 3(c)-3(e), the model learnt from FedML can achieve significantly better adaptation performance at the target nodes compared with that in Fedavg, and this performance gap increases when the target node has small local datasets. It can be seen that the model learnt in Fedavg turns to have overfitting issues when fine-tuned with a few data samples, whereas the meta-model in FedML improves with additional gradient steps without overfitting.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a platform-aided collaborative learning framework, where a model is first trained across a set of source edge nodes by a federated meta-learning approach, and then it is rapidly adapted to achieve real-time edge intelligence at the target edge node, using a few samples only. We investigate the convergence of FedML under mild conditions on node similarity , and study the adaptation performance to achieve edge intelligence at the target node. To combat against the vulnerability of meta-learning algorithms, we further propose a robust FedML algorithm based on DRO with convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various datasets corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative learning framework.</p>
