<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">As digital transformation continues, enterprises are generating, managing, and storing vast amounts of data, while artificial intelligence technology is rapidly advancing. However, it brings challenges in information security and data security. Data security refers to the protection of digital information from unauthorized access, damage, theft, etc. throughout its entire life cycle. With the promulgation and implementation of data security laws and the emphasis on data security and data privacy by organizations and users, Privacy-preserving technology represented by federated learning has a wide range of application scenarios. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning computing framework that allows multiple subjects to train joint models without sharing data to protect data privacy and solve the problem of data islands. However, the data among multiple subjects are independent of each other, and the data differences in quality may cause fairness issues in federated learning modeling, such as data bias among multiple subjects, resulting in biased and discriminatory models. Therefore, we propose DBFed, a <span id="id13.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">d</span>e<span id="id13.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">b</span>iasing <span id="id13.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">fed</span>erated learning framework based on domain-independent, which mitigates model bias by explicitly encoding sensitive attributes during client-side training. This paper conducts experiments on three real datasets and uses five evaluation metrics of accuracy and fairness to quantify the effect of the model. Most metrics of DBFed exceed those of the other three comparative methods, fully demonstrating the debiasing effect of DBFed.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Artificial intelligence technology relies heavily on large amounts of data as input, which is used for learning and training to recognize patterns, discover rules, make decisions, and predict outcomes. This data can be structured, such as table data in a database, or unstructured, such as images, text, and speech. Due to the diversity and scale of data, AI technology requires powerful computing capabilities and algorithm support to realize its application value. Additionally, to protect personal privacy and data security, reasonable restrictions and protections need to be placed on the use of sensitive data. Therefore, as AI technology continues to evolve, ensuring the quality and security of data in terms of acquisition, storage, sharing, and utilization becomes an important issue. For enterprises, expanding data sources, establishing a complete data lifecycle management system, and adopting privacy-preserving computing technology can better utilize data resources, improve the efficiency of mining and utilizing data value, and better meet the needs of data security and privacy protection. Therefore, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, how to ensure the quality and security of data in terms of data acquisition, storage, sharing, and utilization through privacy computing technology has become an important frontier research topic. Many fields, such as finance, healthcare, and communication<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, have extremely high requirements for data security. As a result, data between different institutions often becomes a data island, making it difficult to share and use it safely, resulting in ineffective utilization of data value and hindering the development of artificial intelligence technology. In order to protect data security, Privacy-preserving computation technology represented by federated learning has been widely applied in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy-preserving computation refers to a computing mode for computing and data processing under the premise of protecting data privacy. It can encrypt, share, calculate, and analyze data without exposing the original data, thereby protecting personal privacy and business secrets. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning technology that allows multiple participants to jointly train a model, but each participant can only access local data, thereby protecting data privacy. Federated learning can avoid collecting and storing user data on a central server, which better protects user privacy. However, the issue of fairness also becomes more important when using federated learning. Fairness issues usually involve inequalities between different participants, including data imbalance, computing resource imbalance, capability differences, etc. Fairness issues in federated learning can be grouped into the following categories:</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a distributed machine learning framework proposed by McMahan et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which allows clients to collaborate with each other to train machine learning models without exposing their own data. Nowadays, federated learning has been applied to fields such as healthcare and finance. Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and others divided federal learning into horizontal federal learning, vertical federal learning, and federal transfer learning according to the distribution and alignment characteristics of data in the model training process. In the horizontal federated learning framework, datasets from different clients share the same sample space, but the samples are different; In the vertical federated learning framework, datasets from different clients have the same or partially identical sample IDs, but the feature spaces of the datasets are not the same; In the federated transfer learning framework, the sample ID and feature space of datasets on different clients are different, but different clients have similar business scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, the client protects local data privacy by passing model gradients or weights instead of data sharing. However, Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> showed that gradient leakage attacks could achieve recovery of client datasets, thereby compromising customer data privacy. After obtaining gradients, this method randomly generates a pair of pseudo features and pseudo labels to perform forward and backward propagation, After deriving the gradient, optimize the pseudo features and pseudo labels by minimizing the distance between the pseudo gradient and the real gradient, so that the pseudo data continuously approaches the original data. Hanchi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed an adversarial generation network for generating random data to minimize the distance between pseudo gradients and real gradients, thereby inferring the raw data of federated learning clients. Melis et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> have demonstrated that malicious clients can deceive the global model by using multitasking learning, allowing the model to learn more of its desired features and extract more data information from other clients. In order to protect the privacy of clients in the federated learning process, researchers applied homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> to federated learning. Homomorphic encryption applies the encryption algorithm to the process of gradient exchange. The value encrypted by the algorithm is decoded after addition and multiplication, and the result is the same as that of decoding before the operation. Therefore, it can effectively protect data privacy in the gradient exchange process between the client and the server. But homomorphic encryption reduces the computational efficiency of the federated learning framework. Differential privacy effectively protects data privacy by adding noise to the dataset or blurring certain features through generalization methods, making it difficult for attackers to distinguish between samples and recover data. However, due to modifications made to the dataset, differential privacy technology usually needs to balance accuracy and security.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Many researchers have made trade-offs between security, computational efficiency, and accuracy in federated learning, and have improved and optimized the federated learning framework. The FedCG proposed by Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. utilizes conditional adversarial generation networks to achieve a high level of privacy protection while maintaining the computational performance of the model. FedCG has a private extractor and a public classifier on each client, and in the process of weight aggregation, a client generator is used instead of a public extractor. The client knowledge is aggregated through knowledge distillation, protect and the privacy of extractor weights prevents user information leakage while aggregating client knowledge. In the training process of the client, the extractor and classifier are first trained to learn the features of the local dataset, and the output distribution of the extractor is closer to the generation distribution of the generator. Then, the local adversarial generation network, namely the generator, and the discriminator are trained separately from the local data to improve the accuracy of the model. Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed a method to aggregate client knowledge through knowledge distillation without using additional data. They set up a lightweight generator on the server and used the learned knowledge as induction bias to adjust local training. This method uses fewer communication times and has good generalization ability.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although machine learning models have been applied to a wide range of life scenarios such as face recognition and medical image analysis, some models make decisions based on information such as race, gender, and nationality, resulting in algorithmic bias. As Larson et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> once pointed out, the COMPAS system has a certain degree of racial biases. The research of Kohavi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> shows that under the same circumstances, the deep neural network usually predicts that male salaries are higher than females. Ashraf et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> pointed out that commercial gender classification systems developed by Microsoft, Face++, and IBM have a high recognition error rate for dark-skinned women. Some works have proposed solutions to algorithmic bias. Mehrabi et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>divided the solutions to algorithmic bias into three types: preprocessing, in-process, and post-processing. Preprocessing technology eliminates or alleviates algorithm bias by changing the training dataset; in-process technology modifies the machine learning algorithm itself to eliminate or reduce algorithm bias during training; postprocessing technology usually refers that by regarding the trained model as back-box, the label output by the black-box is recalculated according to a new function to eliminate or reduce algorithm bias. In the field of community detection, Mehrabi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a community detection method for nodes with low connection attributes, which can alleviate the bias of low-degree nodes. In the field of classifiers, Bilal et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>proposed a fair constraint to prevent classifiers from making predictions related to sensitive attributes in the data, and Kamishima et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> controlled classification accuracy and results by adjusting regularization parameters and the trade-off between fairness. This regularization method is applicable to any probabilistic discriminant model prediction algorithm. In the field of language models, Bordia et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a regularization loss term for language models, which minimizes the projection of the encoder-trained embeddings onto the gender-encoding embedding subspace, effectively alleviating gender bias in language models. In the field of causal inference, Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a framework for discovering and eliminating bias for causal networks, capturing direct and indirect discrimination through the causal effects of protected attributes on decisions passed along different causal paths.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The problems of algorithm bias and model fairness also exist in the field of federated learning. In recent years, some researchers have proposed some debiasing methods under the framework of federated learning. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>designed a reward mechanism to adjust the training model’s accuracy and fairness, which drives fairness across all demographic groups and addresses the challenges of limited information and limited coordination. The FairBatch framework proposed by Roh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, while retaining the standard training algorithm as an internal optimizer, incorporates an external optimizer to equip the internal problem with additional features, implementing adaptively choosing the mini-batch size, so that it will improve the fairness of the model. This framework can significantly improve the fairness of any pre-trained model through fine-tuning. Papadaki et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed an algorithm for maximum and minimum fairness in federated learning, where the server requires each client to explicitly share the performance of the model on each race separately.</p>

After a certain number of rounds, the clients send the local model weights to the server, and the server performs federated average aggregation on the model weights of the client to obtain global model weights and then distributes the global model weights to the client. The specific process of client training and server aggregation will be introduced in detail below.</p>

In each round, the server first sends the global model weights of this round to each client, and then each client receives the global model weights and performs local training in parallel. The client executes many iterations for each local training. In the iterations, the batch data sets are extracted in batches, and the local model weights are adjusted through gradient descent to optimize the local model loss function. After the client is trained locally, the client sends the local weights to the server. The server receives the weights of all clients in this round and starts to aggregate the weights of this round to obtain the global model weights of a new round, finally ending the communication training of this round.</p>

Resnet34 is a deep residual network with 34 convolutional layers, which is easy to optimize and widely used in computer vision tasks. In the experiment, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> optimizer was used to implement the gradient descent principle, which can achieve high computational efficiency in small memory.

Five clients are set up and randomly divided into equal datasets as their local training dataset. The batch size is 128, and the client performs communication aggregation after every three local training iterations. This paper mainly uses three image datasets, CelebA, FairFace, and UTKFace for experiments. Each image has three channels, R, G, and B, with values ranging from 0 to 255. All images are uniformly adjusted to pixel size.</p>

The experimental effect of DBFed on the CelebA data set is the best. It outperforms other methods in terms of Equality of Opportunity and Demographic Parity and ranks second in terms of Accuracy and Skewed Error Ratio. This shows that DBFed has a good effect on model fairness while having a high prediction accuracy, and effectively reduces the gender bias in smile classification prediction. In the experiments on the FairFace dataset, DBFed achieved the highest Accuracy, but the other four fairness metrics did not significantly surpass other methods. This may be due to the lack of significant unbiased effects caused by the large variety of sensitive attributes in the dataset. In the experiment of UTKFace, this framework outperformed other methods in terms of Skewed Error Ratio, Bias Amplification, and population equality while achieving high accuracy, indicating excellent results in model accuracy and fairness.
Overall, DBFed performs well in both model accuracy and fairness, effectively reducing population discrimination when performing classification tasks.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a debiasing federated learning framework
based on domain-independent that can predict classification without using sensitive attribute labels, mitigate model bias model biases during federated learning, and improve model fairness. This paper verifies the depolarization effect of DBFed through experiments on three datasets and five evaluation metrics. In addition, due to the need for sensitive attribute labels during the training process, there are certain requirements for dataset annotation. The research in this paper is a new attempt at model fairness under the federated learning computing architecture, which can be applied to many scenarios that require high data security, such as model fine-tuning and model unbinding in human recognition or fund trading intelligent dialogue models in the financial field. The next research direction will focus on exploring how to remove model biases in federated learning processes without using sensitive attribute labels and strive to perform better debiasing effects on more categories of the sensitive attribute.
