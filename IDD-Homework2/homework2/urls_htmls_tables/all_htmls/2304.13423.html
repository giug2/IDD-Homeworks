<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Clustered federated Multitask learning is introduced as an efficient technique when data is unbalanced and distributed amongst clients in a non-independent and identically distributed manner.
While a similarity metric can provide client groups with specialized models according to their data distribution, this process can be time-consuming because the server needs to capture all data distribution first from all clients to perform the correct clustering.
Due to resource and time constraints at the network edge, only a fraction of devices is selected every round, necessitating the need for an efficient scheduling technique to address these issues.
Thus, this paper introduces a two-phased client selection and scheduling approach to improve the convergence speed while capturing all data distributions. This approach ensures correct clustering and fairness between clients by leveraging bandwidth reuse for participants spent a longer time training their models and exploiting the heterogeneity in the devices to schedule the participants according to their delay.
The server then performs the clustering depending on predetermined thresholds and stopping criteria. When a specified cluster approximates a stopping point, the server employs a greedy selection for that cluster by picking the devices with lower delay and better resources.
The convergence analysis is provided, showing the relationship between the proposed scheduling approach and the convergence rate of the specialized models to obtain convergence bounds under non-i.i.d. data distribution. We carry out extensive simulations, and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms reduce training time and improve the convergence speed by up to 50% while equipping every user with a customized model tailored to its data distribution.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) takes advantage of having edge devices and access points equipped with unrivaled capabilities to conduct complicated tasks and support intelligent services closest to these devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
On MEC, <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Artificial Intelligence</em> (AI), and <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Machine Learning</em> (ML), in particular, have seen rapid advancements and have begun to deliver intelligent services that have the potential to revolutionize our lives.
Several recent studies have looked towards the use of ML techniques for IoT-edge applications, serving as an enabler for this vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Traditional ML techniques, on the other hand, require data to be outsourced and processed in a central spot, which poses a serious privacy threat, boosts the data size transferred by edge nodes, and exacerbates communication delays caused by limited resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a promising decentralized ML solution that copes with these issues while preserving the data in place.
Only model parameters (i.e., weights and biases) are shared with the server while the learning process takes place on edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The server handles the process of developing the global model by collecting and averaging all updates performed by different edge devices. In each global round, the server regularly publishes the most recent global model for further updates. The server repeats these procedures until convergence of the global model to the optimum solution is attained.

Our work focuses primarily on applying FL to edge networks, so we refer to FL as Federated Edge Learning (FEEL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The main difference is that in FL, the cloud server can engage many different clients from different locations, whereas in FEEL, the training is conducted near the clients over wireless links.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">When deploying FEEL, statistical and resource heterogeneity are considered the key challenges.
For the statistical heterogeneity, the data amongst edge devices is distributed in a non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) and unbalanced fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Regarding the resource heterogeneity challenge, the devices are heterogeneous, with different computation and communication capabilities. Also, bandwidth is restricted, limiting the number of devices willing to participate in a given FEEL round. This emphasizes the importance of practical and effective selection and scheduling algorithms that improve the convergence rate and produce an unbiased model that can optimally fit all incongruent data distributions, particularly in large-scale edge networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the statistical challenges, considerable research efforts have been devoted to studying and tackling this issue under different FEEL settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Among all these solutions, Clustered Multi-tasks Federated Learning (CFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> demonstrated exceptional performance by striking a balance between learning and cost. The geometry of the FEEL loss surface is utilized by CFL to cluster service users into groups using data distributions that can be trained at the federal level.
It is worth mentioning that conventional FL implies that just a single global model is always being trained for all clients regardless of the discrepancies in their data distribution.
On the other hand, Sattler <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proved that these assumptions are commonly violated in realistic applications.
In particular, it is demonstrated that at each stationary point of the FL main objective, the similarities between the local models of different participants could be measured using cosine similarity to deduce the groupings of participants with contradictory distributions (i.e., incongruent distributions).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The key advantage of CFL, in to multi-task FEEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> which learns several models for several related tasks and personalized FEEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> which provides each participant (i.e., participating client) with a customized model, is that CFL does not necessitate any change to the underlying FEEL communication protocol even though clustering occurs only after the conventional FL model reaches to a stationary point. CFL is interpreted as a post-processing scheme that can strengthen the FEEL performance by properly clustering all clients and effectively producing a customized model for each cluster. Recently, the investigations in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> followed up on the CFL-based methodology and verified that CFL is more reliable for attaining higher accuracy than the traditional FEEL when the data is heterogeneous and non-i.i.d.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Several studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> have sought to solve the challenge of participants’ scheduling and resource allocation (i.e., resource heterogeneity challenges) while taking non-i.i.d. data distribution (i.e., statistical challenges). For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed several techniques to select participants during each round of federated averaging, prioritizing those with lower training latency, better communication and computation resources, or lower energy consumption, under the assumption that each client holds the same amount of data (i.e., balanced). Yet, neither of these works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> consider the scheduling problem for the CFL technique, which requires capturing all data distributions from all clients to perform the correct clustering based on their data distributions. This means that the scheduling approaches in the literature for traditional FL are not applicable to CFL. If devices with better channels or lower latency are regularly selected to participate in the training, the resulting models will be biased since other devices not engaged in training may have different data distributions. The challenge of scheduling in CFL is a crucial issue that remains unresolved and requires further investigation.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In response to all these remarks, this work proposes a new client scheduling framework for CFL over wireless edge networks to minimize training time and expedite the rate of convergence while equipping every group of devices with the optimal model that closely fits their data distribution.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The study of FL deployment via edge networks from various perspectives has gained a lot of interest in the literature.
A decentralized stochastic gradient descent approach was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> considering the context of a bandwidth limit in several channel conditions, where every client is chosen opportunistically for transmission according to its channel state.
Earlier works considered perfect updates-upload tasks to address the delay aspects’ challenges in FEEL. Yet, the impacts of wireless channels are ignored, especially the ability to leverage the characteristics of the channels (e.g., fading, multi-access, and broadcasting) to reduce the latency. Therefore, the broadband analogue aggregation technique is fine-tuned for probabilistic channels due to restricted radio spectrum, particularly channel capacity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
To be more precise, prior to transmitting the models, the edge devices assess the sparsity of the gradients and then transfer them to a lower-dimensional realm constrained by the limited channel capacity. In addition, the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> investigated the convergence of the FL algorithm across wireless links, taking into account the effect of unstable connections on the global model convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> introduced a solution to optimize the accuracy and cost under unreliable wireless channels. However, all analytical expressions are accounted for in the convex ML setting (not addressing the non-convexity of the deep learning algorithm).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Focusing on scheduling policies and participants’ selection, to minimize the latency during the FL training process, several client scheduling techniques were proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. The aim is to improve the speed of the convergence rate as well as address the limitations of communication and communication resources. For example, Amiri <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> evaluated four alternative update quantization-based scheduling strategies. However, the authors first assumed a data symmetry among all the clients; second, they utilized stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which needs more rounds to converge on the small data. Third, data heterogeneity was not considered, so the clients with the best channels and significant L2-norm differences control the global model, resulting in a biased model. Moreover, the researchers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> developed a new client strategy depending on the direction of the updated gradient. This strategy, however, would almost certainly result in a skewed model, particularly for a high degree of non-i.i.d. The models with various gradient directions will not be reflected in the global model version. Lately, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, studied the client selection for hierarchical FL where the connections keep changing while the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed approaches either to minimize the energy or to apply semi-supervised learning. Huang <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> investigated the client selection problem, considering a volatile context scenario in such a way that some selected clients may not succeed in finishing their training and uploading tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude, although considerable works were devoted to optimally selecting and scheduling the participants over a wireless edge network, they only work for the traditional FL where all clients aim to train only a single model. However, CFL is entirely different from a theoretical point of view, where all incongruent data distributions must be captured in order to produce more reliable and efficient models that optimally fit the distributions of the data amongst clients. For that, a more reliable scheduling framework should be considered to enable efficient CFL systems at the network edge.</p>

As previously stated, the connections between the devices and the server are made via an unreliable wireless link. Also, the devices themselves are resource-constrained, posing the challenge of scheduling and selecting participants in order to improve the convergence speed and minimize training time, particularly for CFL, where the main objective is to train a set of models rather than a single model as in conventional training.

Due to limited resources, the former assumption is impracticable for deploying CFL at the network edge (i.e., the number of sub-channels with respect to the model size). On the other hand, the latter will not catch all incongruent data distributions amongst participants, posing the challenge of effectively developing a client selection and scheduling strategy while maintaining edge wireless network restrictions and attaining required performance (i.e., efficient specialized models for all clusters). To be more specific, to properly theorize the setting of conventional FL, it is essential to partition clients of incongruent data distributions as early as possible to expedite the convergence rate and minimize associated costs in light of bandwidth as well as data and device heterogeneity. Hence, improving the convergence speed and reducing the total training latency for all resulting specialized models (i.e., the <math id="S4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> group models and one conventional FL model) depends on how we optimally select and schedule the client to compute and upload their updates and how to allocate the resources for the uploading task.

In practice, the CFL mechanism is recursive, relying on the scheduled clients to assist in capturing all incongruent data distributions and provide all clients with the congruent data distribution with the optimal model parameters. Hence, the problem in <a href="#S4.Ex1" title="Equation P1 ‣ IV Problem Formulation ‣ Fair Selection of Edge Nodes to Participate in Clustered Federated Multitask Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">P1</span></a> is solved iteratively later on as follows.
First, to address the difficulties encountered by requiring to schedule all clients in each round to prevent biased models, we propose an efficient scheduling algorithm that accounts for the challenges mentioned above. Then, we extend the CFL algorithm, taking into account computing and communication resources and the deadline constraints. Last, we analytically find the relationship between the selected participants, the round deadline, and the convergence rate for the congruent and incongruent data distributions.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this algorithm, the scheduling and selection procedure includes two phases. In the first phase, the server copes equally with all available clients to perform the correct clustering at the early stages of the training. Thus, all existing clients are selected to carry out the global model updates until a specific cluster reaches the stopping point (i.e., all cluster members have the same data distribution). In the second phase, the server uses the greedy approach for each cluster, reaching the stopping point where the clients with less latency are only selected to carry out further model updates.

Algorithm 1 starts with an initialization step by clustering all clients in one group. Then, the server aggregates prior information such as the data size, channel state, and computational capabilities from all existing clients (line 2). In lines 3-4, the algorithm checks whether the clustering was performed before or not. If achieved, the server checks the stopping condition (<a href="#S5.E21" title="Equation 21 ‣ V Proposed Solution ‣ Fair Selection of Edge Nodes to Participate in Clustered Federated Multitask Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">21</span></a>), and selects the best clients having less latency to take part in the training from that group, while all clients are selected for others. Otherwise, the server determines all clients to participate in the FEEL round.  In Algorithm. <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ V Proposed Solution ‣ Fair Selection of Edge Nodes to Participate in Clustered Federated Multitask Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we observe that whenever a given cluster approaches the stationary point of its model (lines 2–7), the server shifts to employing a greedy selection algorithm in which the clients with less training time and better resources are selected to conduct subsequent updates. This is due to the fact that clients with similar data distribution (i.e., congruent data distribution) behave likewise. For each cluster not reaching a stationary point, the server estimates all clients’ latency (line 8) to schedule uploading the local models’ updates and find the aggregation set (line 9) due to the limited bandwidth. In line 10, the server broadcasts the latest updated models to the selected clients. In lines (11–14), all chosen clients perform conventional FEEL updates and return them to the coordinating, which collects (line 15) all updates based on the aggregation sets. In lines 16-29, the server runs the clustering algorithm to cluster the participants according to their local data distribution if the model of the last cluster reaches the stationary points. Otherwise, the server will keep using the traditional FEEL algorithm. All these steps are repeated until all models reach the stationary points and all incongruent data distributions are captured as in Algorithm. <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ V Proposed Solution ‣ Fair Selection of Edge Nodes to Participate in Clustered Federated Multitask Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. It is worth mentioning that since the server depends on the uploaded models, clustering the participants isn’t affected by the mobility of the devices as long as they are within the server’s coverage area.</p>

Now, we find the relationship between the participating clients, the number of epochs and data samples, and the convergence rate. We follow the steps similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. However, in our work, we consider the CFL as model training and the mini-batch SGD as a local solver where the number of updates performed locally is proportional to the number of data samples. It is worth noting that we consider unbalanced data distribution where the number of examples (i.e., data points) is randomly distributed following the power law. Consequently, the number of local iterations can be calculated as in (<a href="#S3.E1" title="Equation 1 ‣ III-A FEEL model ‣ III System Model ‣ Fair Selection of Edge Nodes to Participate in Clustered Federated Multitask Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

We use two federated datasets, FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, for handwriting classification and object recognition, respectively. Specifically, FEMNIST is utilized for handwriting classifications of both letters and digits (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9), and it has 305,654, 28 x 28, images while CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 colored images. We split both datasets for each device into 80% for training and 2% for testing. Further, we utilize both datasets in a non-i.i.d. manner, whereas we split each dataset into <math id="S7.SS1.p1.18.m18.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{I}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS1.p1.18.m18.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S7.SS1.p1.18.m18.1.1" xref="S7.SS1.p1.18.m18.1.1.cmml">ℐ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS1.p1.18.m18.1b"><ci id="S7.SS1.p1.18.m18.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS1.p1.18.m18.1.1">ℐ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS1.p1.18.m18.1c">\mathcal{I}</annotation></semantics></math> fragments, and then we assign each device only two random classes. For the model architecture, the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier is adopted for FEMNIST, and Alexnet—a deep neural network (DNN) is adopted for CIFAR-10. In our models, we employed 2 hidden layers in the FEMNIST model and 13 hidden layers in the CIFAR-10 model. For both learning tasks, we utilized the ReLU activation function for the hidden layers and the Softmax activation function for the output layer. To simplify the presentation, we list all simulation parameters in Table <a href="#S7.T2" title="Table II ‣ VII-A Experimental Setup ‣ VII Numerical Experiments ‣ Fair Selection of Edge Nodes to Participate in Clustered Federated Multitask Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.</p>

From both figures, it is clear to note that our proposed approach (fairness followed by greedy approach) gains a much faster convergence rate regarding the speed of clustering since the partitioning starts at the training round of index 37, whereas the partitioning using the random scheduling algorithm starts at the training round of index 83. This confirms that the acceleration rate of the proposed algorithm is 2x faster than the benchmarks. It is noted that in our approach, the partitioning actually takes place again for all participants with incongruent distributions at global training rounds of index 45 and 63, respectively until no further clustering is possible.
All trained models achieve the stopping criteria as in (21) at round 190, proving that clustering is correctly performed, according to <a href="#S7.F4.sf1" title="In Fig. 4 ‣ VII-C Numerical Results ‣ VII Numerical Experiments ‣ Fair Selection of Edge Nodes to Participate in Clustered Federated Multitask Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(a)</span></a> right.
On the other hand, the baseline algorithm, <a href="#S7.F4.sf2" title="In Fig. 4 ‣ VII-C Numerical Results ‣ VII Numerical Experiments ‣ Fair Selection of Edge Nodes to Participate in Clustered Federated Multitask Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(b)</span></a> right, shows that the CFL still requires many more rounds to reach the stopping point at round 200.
This is owing to the random client scheduling behavior, which may choose clients who have previously been grouped, bringing out the need for many more rounds to capture the data amongst clients to perform the correct clustering. For example, the clustering becomes slow if clients with different data distributions are randomly selected at the latter rounds.</p>

This stems from the fact that the server stays connected with the same clients during all global rounds in those approaches, particularly when the channel is not changing rapidly, leading to biased models that can only fit the participants’ clients. In addition, random scheduling provides less accuracy gaps due to the randomness of participant selection. Nevertheless, the proposed scheduling approach substantially outperforms all benchmarks and provides much more stable accuracy regardless of the distribution of the data and the number of clients in the network.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed novel client scheduling and selection algorithms for clustered federated multitask learning to reduce the training latency and speed up the convergence rate, which improves the resulting model for each cluster. The proposed algorithms are based on the fairness between the clients across the network, where all available clients have equal chances of being selected to take part in the training process regardless of the channel state or the size of their local data. This enables the edge system to imbue the clients with more specialized models rather than having biased models. Given non-i.i.d. and unbalanced data distribution, clients’ heterogeneity, and restricted bandwidth, we have first formulated an optimization problem to obtain the best client scheduling that minimizes the training cost and improves the convergence speed. We have analyzed the relationship between the proposed scheduling approach and the convergence rate of the specialized models. We have conducted extensive simulation experiments using realistic federated datasets, FEMNIST and CIFAR-10. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach efficiently reduces the training latency and accelerates convergence while attaining a satisfying performance. For future research, it will be interesting to adapt the age of the updates for the missing clients’ updates and find the optimal thresholds for the splitting conditions.</p>
