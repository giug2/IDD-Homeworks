<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the neural network backdoor hidden in the parameters of the federated learning model has been proved to have great security risks. Considering the characteristics of trigger generation, data poisoning and model training in backdoor attack, this paper designs a backdoor attack method based on federated learning. Firstly, aiming at the concealment of the backdoor trigger, a TrojanGan steganography model with encoder-decoder structure is designed. The model can encode specific attack information as invisible noise and attach it to the image as a backdoor trigger, which improves the concealment and data transformations of the backdoor trigger.Secondly, aiming at the problem of single backdoor trigger mode, an image poisoning attack method called combination trigger attack is proposed. This method realizes multi-backdoor triggering by multiplexing combined triggers and improves the robustness of backdoor attacks. Finally, aiming at the problem that the local training mechanism leads to the decrease of the success rate of backdoor attack, a dual model replacement backdoor attack algorithm based on federated learning is designed. This method can improve the success rate of backdoor attack while maintaining the performance of the federated learning aggregation model. Experiments show that the attack strategy in this paper can not only achieve high backdoor concealment and diversification of trigger forms under federated learning, but also achieve good attack success rate in multi-target attacks.door concealment and diversification of trigger forms but also achieve good results in multi-target attacks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has been greatly developed as an emerging deep learning framework. To solve the problem of data privacy, the participant’s local data and training process cannot be accessed by the server. Because of this feature, malicious attackers can inject the backdoor into the local model by tampering with the local dataset, and then affect the server-side aggregation model by uploading the poisoning model. For researchers, the black box and inexplicability of model parameters also pose great challenges. How to effectively prevent such backdoor attacks is still an urgent problem to be solved. At the same time, the development of attack methods has also attracted great interest from academia and industry.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The backdoor attack is mainly from the following three aspects, respectively, trigger generation, data poisoning, and model training. In the existing trigger generation methods, pixel blocks or translucent patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> are mainly added to the image as backdoor triggers. The single fixed feature of the trigger reduces the concealment of the backdoor. Data poisoning is a key step in backdoor attack, which achieves different attack effects by changing the number or style of triggers on the image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, the current backdoor attack schemes often ignore the research on multi-target attacks. With the continuous emergence of new model training methods, there have been studies on backdoor attacks in the model training phase. Federated learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, but these studies did not combine the latest backdoor triggers or data poisoning methods. The backdoor attack scheme for the neural network model under the federated learning training method still has optimization space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, such as the low concealment of the trigger and the single attack target. The goal of the current backdoor attack research is to pursue hidden backdoor triggers, diversified attack targets, and novel backdoor attack model training methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">At present, the trigger has the problem of single attack target. Although the data poisoning method can achieve multi-target attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, adding multiple visible triggers will greatly reduce the concealment of the backdoor. At the same time, backdoor attacks in federal learning are not efficient. Therefore, the multi-target backdoor attack method based on federated learning still has the following challenges :</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Trigger concealment. The amount of hidden data on the trigger has a great influence on the model recognition performance, but improving the concealment of the trigger will reduce the amount of hidden data. How to balance the concealment of triggers and the amount of hidden data is a difficult problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Single trigger mode. Under the condition that the total amount of poisoning data is constant, the poisoning data injected into the train set becomes various types, and the segmentation of the poisoning dataset is bound to affect the injection efficiency of the backdoor. How to improve the injection efficiency of the backdoor in the multi-trigger mode becomes a challenge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Federal learning backdoor attack. The federal learning training strategy is to achieve global model training by aggregating local model parameters. The local backdoor model training process and parameter upload weights determine the effect of backdoor attacks. How to implement the multi-target backdoor injection algorithm of federated learning locally is a problem worthy of study.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above problems, this paper comprehensively considers three aspects: trigger generation, data poisoning, and model training, and proposes an invisible multi-target backdoor attack method based on federated learning. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, the TrojanGan steganography model of encoder-decoder structure is designed. The model combines the image attention mechanism with the DenseNet network structure, hides the attack information coding into the image, and improves the concealment of the backdoor trigger.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, an image poisoning attack method CTA(Combination Trigger Attack) that can combine triggers is proposed. With the help of the TrojanGan encoder, the attack information is hidden into different half-zones of the image as a single trigger, and the half-zone triggers are combined to form a combined trigger, and a poisoning dataset is formed to create a pre-trained backdoor model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, the attack algorithm DMR-FLBA(Dual Model Replacement Federal Learning Backdoor Attack) is introduced to ensure that the local backdoor model plays a leading role in the aggregation process. The pre-trained backdoor model is used to replace the federated learning local model, and the backdoor model is modified to upload weights to replace the aggregation model, to maximize the impact of the backdoor model and effectively improve the efficiency of the multi-target backdoor attack of the aggregation model.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Backdoor attack have been an emerging research field in recent years, and DNN is also promoting the development of backdoor attack research. The following article will focus on the three aspects of trigger generation, data poisoning, and federated learning model training, focusing on and analyzing the achievements of researchers in recent years.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First of all, around the steganography of the trigger, to make the backdoor trigger more concealed, the research on the trigger has changed from the visible trigger to the invisible trigger. As a pioneering work of DNN backdoor attack, Gu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> first used visible pixel blocks as backdoor triggers to prove the threat of backdoors to DNN models. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> randomly transformed the poisoned image before training and confirmed that the enhanced attack is still available in the physical world. In the subsequent research, Barni et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> tried to embed the trigger into the image in a translucent watermark way, but these triggers are still visible. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> realized the steganography of trigger by using an image steganography algorithm and regularization method. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> realized the steganography of trigger by using an encoder-decoder structure network. The above article improves the concealment of the trigger through continuous improvement of the trigger generation method. However, there is still room for further optimization between the steganography performance and the steganography capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, around the data poisoning method, adding triggers to the image through a reasonable method can achieve a more powerful backdoor attack effect. Nguyen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> achieved n-to-one attack effect by generating dynamic pixel triggers based on different images. Xue et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> achieved the effect of one-to-n target attack by controlling the pixel value intensity of triggers and achieved the effect of n-to-one attack by combining multiple triggers. Gong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> put the triggers in different positions of the image during model training to eliminate the location restrictions on the triggers during the attack phase. Xiao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> used combined pixels to propose a dynamic trigger using random locations to achieve multi-target attacks. Xue et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> achieved the multi-target attack effect by adding a steganography trigger to different channels of the image. The above research has achieved the purpose of multi-target attack by changing the location of triggers or using multiple triggers, but there is still great research value in the way of adding triggers on images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, focusing on the training method of federated learning model, Bagdasaryan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and Bhagoji et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> first carried out the backdoor attack research under federated learning, confirming that the model after federated learning can be injected into the backdoor, and then Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed a marginal backdoor under federal learning. Gong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a distributed backdoor attack scheme based on the training characteristics of federated learning, which further improved the success rate of backdoor attack. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed the use of generative adversarial networks to generate poisoning data to achieve the purpose of attack by the characteristics of federal learning global shared parameters. Gu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> used the potential representation output of the federated learning participant model to complete the backdoor attack with the help of a small number of labeled samples. The above articles have studied the backdoor attack under federal learning in the poisoning method. At present, the backdoor attack method under federal learning is in the exploratory stage, and the poisoning algorithm still needs to be further explored by researchers.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper comprehensively considers the attack characteristics of the three stages of trigger generation, data poisoning, and model training in backdoor attacks, and proposes a multi-target backdoor attack method based on federated learning. The overall architecture of the proposed method is shown in Fig.<a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ IV MODEL ‣ Dual Model Replacement: invisible Multi-target Backdoor Attack based on Federal Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The method is mainly divided into three stages : First, the TrojanGan network is designed to steal the encoded information into the image, generate a steganography trigger, and improve the concealment of the trigger. Then, an image poisoning attack method CTA that can combine triggers is proposed to generate different types of poisoning datasets and create a pre-trained backdoor model. Finally, this paper proposes a dual model replacement backdoor attack algorithm based on federated learning. The dual model replacement method is used to effectively improve the success rate of multi-target backdoor attack.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To further enhance the harmfulness of backdoor attack and improve the anti-detection of poisoning dataset. In this paper, an image poisoning attack method CTA ( Combination Trigger Attack ) is proposed. By constructing a multi-type poisoning dataset containing combined triggers, different backdoors hidden in the dataset are implanted into the pre-training model, and a multi-target backdoor attack is realized through the reuse of triggers. At the same time, the coincidence characteristics of the combined trigger and the single trigger in different regions alleviate the problem of low backdoor injection efficiency caused by the dispersion of the poisoning dataset.</p>

This paper proposes a Dual Model Replacement Federal Learning Backdoor Attack (DMR-FLBA) algorithm. The algorithm uses a dual model replacement method, that is, replacing the local model and modifying the weight of the upload model, to increase the influence of the poisoning parameters in all upload parameters, so that each backdoor still exists in the aggregation model after the average algorithm is diluted.</p>

Finally, a DMR-FLBA federated learning backdoor training algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of backdoor attacks under multiple triggers.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To implant multiple backdoors into the aggregation model, this paper designs a dual model replacement backdoor attack algorithm DMR-FLBA based on federated learning. The basic idea of the algorithm is as follows: Firstly, the backdoor pre-training model generated according to the CTA method is loaded. Secondly, the first model replacement is performed. According to Formula (<a href="#S4.E14" title="In IV-C Backdoor Federal Learning ‣ IV MODEL ‣ Dual Model Replacement: invisible Multi-target Backdoor Attack based on Federal Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a>), the backdoor pre-training model is combined with the global aggregation model to form a backdoor fusion model. Finally, the second model replacement is carried out, and the upload weight of the local backdoor fusion model parameters is adjusted according to Formula (<a href="#S4.E18" title="In IV-C Backdoor Federal Learning ‣ IV MODEL ‣ Dual Model Replacement: invisible Multi-target Backdoor Attack based on Federal Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>), to enhance the influence of the poisoning parameters in the aggregation model and improve the success rate of multi-target backdoor attack.</p>

By analyzing the residual image, in addition to using the visible pixel trigger of BadNet, WaNet creates a steganography trigger by distorting the edge of the object through random noise, Poison Ink creates a steganography trigger by focusing on the contour edge of the object, and TrojanGan creates a steganography backdoor trigger by focusing on the object itself.

According to Fig.<a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-B3 Federated Learning Backdoor Performance Analysis ‣ V-B Experimental Analysis ‣ V EXPERIMENT ‣ Dual Model Replacement: invisible Multi-target Backdoor Attack based on Federal Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> , the training of DMR-FLBA aggregation model is divided into three stages. The first stage is the latent stage (1-10 rounds). At this stage, each local model performs preliminary iterative learning. The model replacement method fails, the global aggregation parameters are chaotic, and the aggregation model cannot perform image classification. The second stage is the oscillation stage (11-21 rounds). At this stage, each local model is still not fully fitted, but the model replacement gradually takes effect, and the classification performance of the aggregation model begins to improve. The third stage is the fitting stage (21-35 rounds). The model replacement is completed, and the performance of the aggregated model is fully fitted to the pre-trained model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">CBA uses distributed triggers as DBA but improves the performance of triggers. Its advantage is that the ASR of the aggregation model can reach 100% in the CIFAR-10, but BA still has a large room for improvement. Its shortcomings are the same as DBA, that is, the number of poisoned terminals is at least 4 to achieve the expected attack performance, and the backdoor trigger is visible.</p>

Like DMR, the backdoor can be implanted in the aggregation model by modifying the model parameters, and the use of a 9-pixel pattern backdoor trigger has an excellent steganography effect. The disadvantage is that BA and ASR still have room for improvement.</p>

The dual model replacement method makes the aggregation model retain the ASR and BA of the pre-trained model to the greatest extent, and its performance is almost unchanged compared with the pre-trained model. The average ASR of the DMR aggregation model on the CIFAR10 is 99.46%, and the BA is 84.65%, which is better than other baseline models, and its performance on the GTSRB and MS-Celeb-1M is also excellent.

After 20 rounds, the backdoor begins to be successfully implanted into the aggregation model, and the ASR of the aggregation model rises rapidly.

In general, the BA of the aggregation model decreases by about 1% -5%, the ASR decreases to varying degrees and the training process shows a trend of oscillation. For the CIFAR-10, its ASR decreases by about 60%, and for the GTSRB and MS-Celeb-1M, its ASR decreases by about 1%. The reason for this situation is that local training cannot learn the expected parameters because of the fixed learning rate, which leads to the failure of the aggregated model after the pre-training model replacement to fit and ultimately leads to the failure of backdoor injection. This situation is particularly serious for CIFAR10 which requires lower learning rate training. Here, a disadvantage of the dual model replacement method is missed, that is, if the federated learning local model fails to reach the minimum learning rate during the pre-trained model training, the model replacement may fail in the backdoor injection.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper comprehensively considers the three stages of trigger generation, data poisoning, and model training in backdoor attack. Starting from the three aspects of trigger steganography, multi-target attack, and model poisoning, according to the characteristics of federated learning training, an invisible multi-target backdoor attack method under federated learning is designed. Firstly, this paper designs a TrojanGan model to generate a steganography trigger, which balances the steganography performance and recognition performance of the trigger. Secondly, a multi-type poisoning dataset is created for multi-target attacks and a pre-training model is trained. Finally, a dual model replacement method is designed to improve the attack and recognition performance of the federated learning aggregation model. The experimental results show that the DMR-FLBA algorithm can improve the accuracy of identifying normal data while ensuring the high backdoor attack success rate of the aggregation model. In future work, we will explore backdoor defense methods for dual model replacement method in federated learning.</p>
