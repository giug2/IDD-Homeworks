<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Large scale contextual representation models have significantly advanced NLP in recent years, understanding the semantics of text to a degree never seen before. However, they need to process large amounts of data to achieve high-quality results. Joining and accessing all these data from multiple sources can be extremely challenging due to privacy and regulatory reasons. Federated Learning can solve these limitations by training models in a distributed fashion, taking advantage of the hardware of the devices that generate the data. We show the viability of training NLP models, specifically Word2Vec, with the Federated Learning protocol. In particular, we focus on a scenario in which a small number of organizations each hold a relatively large corpus. The results show that neither the quality of the results nor the convergence time in Federated Word2Vec deteriorates as compared to centralised Word2Vec.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A central task in NLP is the generation of word embeddings to encode the meaning of words and their relationships in a vector space. This task is usually performed by a self-supervised Machine Learning (ML) model such as Word2Vec <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mikolov et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, ELMo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Peters et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> or BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Devlin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, with access to a large corpus of documents as input. These representations can then be used to perform advanced analytics on textual data. The larger and more complete the corpus is, the more accurate the representations will be.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As such, it can be useful for multiple organizations to collaborate with each other, each providing access to their corpora, in order to obtain the best results. However, different organizations typically cannot easily share their data, as they have to protect the privacy of their users and the details of their internal operations, or might be bound by external laws preventing the sharing of the data. One way organizations could overcome these issues is by employing Federated Learning protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> to generate a global model without sharing any data. It is therefore fundamental to assess the performance, quality and privacy preservation characteristics of such approach.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.1 </span>Distributed vs data-private massively-distributed approaches</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Datacenter-scale ML algorithms work with vast amounts of data allowing the training of large models, exploiting multiple machines and multiple GPUs per machine. Currently, GPUs offer enough power to satisfy the needs of state of the art models. However, this exposes another important aspect for consideration - Data Privacy. In recent years, users and governments have started to be aware of this issue, publishing new and stricter regulations, such as the GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">European Commission (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Companies started making efforts to shield themselves from any security leak that could happen in a centralised system. This created a need to move the research towards distributed architectures where the data is not gathered by a central entity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The fast development of smart devices, the growth of their computational power and of fast Internet connections, like 4G and 5G, enable new approaches that exploit them to train distributed models. This solution is currently not at the same scale of resources that a datacenter can offer yet, but the research and development of edge devices is making it feasible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For these reasons, researchers are exploring the possibilities of different massively-distributed training designs. These new designs should offer scalability, ensure data privacy and reduce large traffic of data over the network. The main massively-distributed approach to large-scale training that fulfills all these requirements is Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al.

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is frequently applied in a commercial, global-scale setting as an on-device learning framework. In this common scenario, many small devices, like smartphones, collaborate and grant access to their data, typically small due to storage limitations, to train a higher-quality model. These models are usually NLP applications to make suggestions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> or predict a user behaviour <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hard et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, Federated Learning could be applied in different contexts. This paper shifts the focus to address a new scenario where the users are a small number of large organizations with access to large corpora, which cannot be shared or centralised. These organizations are willing to cooperate in order to have access to a larger corpus with diverse topics and to overcome the very strict data privacy policies. A practical example could be a group of government agencies, each of which has only access to sensitive documents in a specific domain (e.g. taxes), which alone would not be sufficient for high-quality training.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning addresses the privacy concerns as the data is not shared between the organizations. It stays in the node of the owner and the information transferred through the network is only the gradient of the model. It also avoids the expensive transfer of the training data, replacing it with the repeated transfer of gradients, the total size of which is, generally, less than that of the dataset. And even if repeated gradient exchanges were to surpass the size of the dataset, their transfer would be spread on a long time and divided in smaller batches, so it would not delay the training as much as having to send a huge dataset before starting. The only common point that all the nodes share in this architecture is the existence of a central node which oversees the training process, directing the data transfers and merging the contributions of each node. Having the central node can facilitate the inclusion of additional safety measures to shield the training process from malicious attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bhagoji et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.5" class="ltx_p">In Federated Word2Vec, each organization owns a private dataset, which means that words that appear in the corpus of one organization may not be present in the one of another. This an issue as the input vocabulary must be common to all local models, so that the gradients can be aggregated. Preserving the privacy of the content of the text is very important, so this paper will overcome the aforementioned issue through a strategy that consists of a common agreement of all the participants in a global vocabulary. All must agree on a fixed vocabulary size <math id="S2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">N</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1c">N</annotation></semantics></math> and a minimum threshold of occurrences <math id="S2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.2.m2.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math>.

The privacy is preserved as the organizations only share a set of isolated, unsorted words. However, the question arises of how to merge these sets. There are two operations that can be applied to produce the final vocabulary: intersection and union. We use, and recommend to use, the union operation. The final vocabulary is larger than the initial size <math id="S2.p2.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S2.p2.5.m5.1.1" xref="S2.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml">N</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S2.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.5.m5.1.1">𝑁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.5.m5.1c">N</annotation></semantics></math>, but all organizations keep their relevant words. Although this approach requires more time to converge due to many words appearing only in certain datasets, the words meaning and knowledge return to the participants is enriched.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Once the participants receive the common agreed vocabulary, the training process can start following the FederatedSGD algorithm from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. The gradient is transferred from all the external nodes to the main node in each iteration.

Two Wikipedia dumps were downloaded to satisfy the aforementioned datasets characteristics: a partial dump with a compressed size of 180 MB to simulate small organizations with short corpora; and a 16 GB compressed file with all the text content published in Wikipedia. From the whole Wikipedia dump, the Wikipedia Extractor script <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Baugh and Flor (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> is used with a tag to filter categories and prepare 5 different datasets divided by topic. The chosen topics are: biology, history, finance, geography, and sports. Although the themes are quite specific, some articles can appear in more than one dataset because of the distribution of the Wikipedia tree of categories. So, if an article is tagged with the biology category, it is included in the dataset of biological content. In order to simulate a larger number of organizations, every topic is split between two organizations.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of this paper was to implement and test the viability of a distributed, efficient, data-private approach that allows a small number of organizations, each owning a large private text corpus, to train global word representations. The results indicate the potential for applicability to real scenarios of collaborative training. The main contributions of this work are
