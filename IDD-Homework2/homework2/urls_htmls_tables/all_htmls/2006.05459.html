<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated Learning (FL) refers to distributed protocols that avoid direct raw data exchange among the participating devices while training for a common learning task. This way, FL can potentially reduce the information on the local data sets that is leaked via communications. In order to provide formal privacy guarantees, however, it is generally necessary to put in place additional masking mechanisms. When FL is implemented in wireless systems via uncoded transmission, the channel noise can directly act as a privacy-inducing mechanism. This paper demonstrates that, as long as the privacy constraint level, measured via differential privacy (DP), is below a threshold
that decreases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), uncoded transmission achieves privacy “for free”, i.e., without affecting the learning performance. More generally, this work studies adaptive power allocation (PA) for distributed gradient descent in wireless FL with the aim of minimizing the learning optimality gap under privacy and power constraints. Both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission with “over-the-air-computing” are studied, and solutions are obtained in closed form for an offline optimization setting. Furthermore, heuristic online methods are proposed that leverage iterative one-step-ahead optimization. The importance of dynamic PA and the potential benefits of NOMA versus OMA are demonstrated through extensive simulations.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In modern wireless systems, mobile devices generate and store data that can be utilized to train machine learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. While data at one device may be insufficient to obtain effective trained solutions, networked devices can benefit from data stored at other devices via communications.
Federated learning (FL) refers to decentralized training protocols that avoid direct data sharing among devices, while exchanging information about the local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This has the potential benefits of reducing the communication load and of leaking less information about the local data sets at the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. A well-established measure the privacy of local data sets with respect to disclosed aggregate statistics is differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Typical DP mechanisms randomize the disclosed statistics by adding random noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This creates a trade-off between accuracy and privacy, as determined by the amount of added noise.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">This paper investigates the idea of letting the channel noise serve as privacy mechanism. To this end, we focus on uncoded transmission of the gradients using either orthogonal or non-orthogonal protocols, and we analytically demonstrate that for these transmission schemes, privacy may be obtained “for free”. This is in the sense that enforcing a DP constraint causes no performance loss with respect to a non-private design as long as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently low. More generally, we introduce a novel optimal closed-form adaptive transmit power control strategy that optimizes the learning performance while ensuring DP requirements. <span id="S1.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

typical wireless FL protocols iterate between local adaptation and centralized combining. Adaptation involves local optimization steps based on a device’s data, while central aggregation amounts to averaging operations on the devices’ updates. To reduce the time to convergence, recent work has proposed to leverage computations over multiple access channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> as a primitive for the global combining step <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Accordingly, all devices simultaneously transmit their updates to edge server using uncoded transmission, which are aggregated “over-the-air” by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to its original motivation, FL may have desirable privacy properties since training is conducted in a distributed manner without sharing the raw data. Nevertheless, the model updates shared by the devices may reveal information about local data. For example, a malicious server could potentially infer the presence of an individual data sample from a learnt model by membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> or model inversion attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. DP quantifies information leaked about individual data points by measuring the sensitivity of the disclosed statistics to changes in the input data set at a single data point. DP can be guaranteed by introducing a level of uncertainty into the released model that is sufficient to mask the contribution of any individual data point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The most typical approach is to add random perturbations, e.g., Gaussian <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, Laplacian <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, or Binomial noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, to the released statistics.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">DP mechanisms have been investigated for FL under the assumption that the edge server is “honest-but-curious” and that communication is noiseless and unconstrained.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, Gaussian noise is added to the local model updates, and the power of the Gaussian noise is adapted to ensure a target privacy level. Analysis indicates that there is a tradeoff between convergence rate and privacy protection levels.
Furthermore, a higher privacy guarantee is achievable if the DP algorithm uses random mini-batches — the so-called “privacy amplification
by subsampling” principle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

The superposition property of NOMA is shown not only to provide benefits in terms of efficient gradient aggregation, but also to offer better privacy guarantees. Instead of injecting noise before transmission, an energy efficient approach is to scale down the transmit power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. A digital counterpart of these ideas is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> which uses quantized gradient descent with privacy-inducing binomial noise.

As our analysis demonstrates, channel noise added in the first iterations tends to impact convergence less significantly than the noise added in later iterations, whereas the privacy level depends on a weighted sum of the inverse noise power across the iteration. These properties, captured by compact analytical expressions derived in this paper, are leveraged to define optimization problems that are solved in closed form, yielding significant performance gains over standard static power allocation.<span id="S1.SS2.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

Considering OMA and NOMA separately, we first analyze the convergence rate and privacy requirements for a given number of iterations under uncoded transmission. The resulting offline optimization problems are shown to be convex programs, and the optimal dynamic power allocation (PA) is obtained in closed form. The optimal PA is shown to be adaptive across the iterations, outperforming static PA assumed in prior works. The analytical results prove that privacy can be obtained “for free” as long as the privacy constraint level is below a threshold that decreases with the signal-to-noise (SNR). We also demonstrate that it is generally suboptimal to devote part of the transmitted power to actively add noise to the local updates. This is unlike the standard scenario with ideal communication, in which adding noise is essential to ensure DP constraints.</p>

As we will detail, privacy is defined here from the point of view of any device with respect to the edge server, which is assumed to be “honest-but-curious”. Accordingly, the edge server follows the protocol described below, but may attempt to infer information about data at the edge devices. We do not directly enforce privacy constraints on the other devices, which are implicitly trusted. More discussion on this point can be found in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Conclusions ‣ Privacy For Free: Wireless Federated Learning Via Uncoded Transmission With Adaptive Power Control" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.</p>

While NOMA is confirmed to be generally advantageous over OMA, OMA with optimal PA can perform better than NOMA with static PA, which emphasizes the importance of PA optimization, particularly in the high-SNR regime.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have considered differentially private wireless federated learning via the direct, uncoded, transmission of gradient from devices to edge server. The proposed approach is based on adaptive PA schemes that are optimized to minimize the learning optimality gap under privacy and power constraints. First, offline optimization problems are separately formulated for OMA and NOMA, which are converted to convex programs. The optimal PA, obtained in closed form, adapts the power along the iterations, outperforming static PA assumed in prior works. Furthermore, a heuristic online approach is proposed that leverages iterative one-step-ahead optimization based on the offline result and predicted CSI.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The analysis in this paper proved that privacy can be obtained “for free”, that is without affecting the learning performance, as long as the privacy constraint level is below a threshold that decreases with the SNR. Our analytical results also demonstrate that it is generally suboptimal to devote part of the transmitted power to actively add noise to the local updates. This is unlike the standard scenario with ideal communication, in which adding noise is essential to ensure DP constraints. Via numerical results, we have finally shown that techniques that leverage over-the-air computing provide significant benefits over conventional OMA protocols under DP constraints. This is not a prior evident, since, with NOMA, devices transmit more frequently, and hence may leak more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text">We note that the power control policy based on channel inversion for all the devices was proven to be suboptimal in the scenario of over-the-air computing without DP constraint. In fact, channel inversion can incur noise amplification by adapting the power to the device with worst channel condition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. However, this may not be the case under DP constraints since noise amplification benefits privacy. As a possible extension of the current work, it would be interesting to study the optimization of the threshold for channel inversion so as to maximize the learning performance under privacy and power constraints.<span id="S6.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
As directions for future work, the threat model could also include “honest-but-curious” edge devices, which would generally incur larger DP loss. The study could be further generalized to other network topologies including multi-hop device-to-device (D2D) networks. Another interesting direction is to consider the implementation of digital transmission where quantization introduces additional privacy preserving mechanism on top of the channel noise. <span id="S6.p3.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
It would also be interesting to investigate the effect of clipping in terms of convergence as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, and to address the convergence properties of the proposed online scheme.
