<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents an improved scheme for the generation and adaption of synthetic images for the training of deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) to perform the object detection task in smart vending machines. While generating synthetic data has proved to be effective for complementing the training data in supervised learning methods, challenges still exist for generating virtual images which are similar to those of the complex real scenes and minimizing redundant training data. To solve these problems, we consider the simulation of cluttered objects placed in a virtual scene and the wide-angle camera with distortions used to capture the whole scene in the data generation process, and post-processed the generated images with a elaborately-designed generative network to make them more similar to the real images. Various experiments have been conducted to prove the efficiency of using the generated virtual images to enhance the detection precision on existing datasets with limited real training data and the generalization ability of applying the trained network to datasets collected in new environment.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Smart vending machines are emerging recently due to its convenience and low maintenance cost. Vision-based object detection is usually used in those machines for monitoring the changes of products and is thus one of the most important supporting functions. While deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has already shown its advantages in object detection tasks, manual collection and annotation of the large amount of training data are still notably resource and time consuming.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>The overall workflow of the proposed data generation and adaption method. The 3D objects and interior of the vending machine are first reconstructed. The objects are then arranged in complex layout in the environment. Virtual lights and cameras are next set up and may vary during the generation process. The virtual images are rendered with these settings and their styles are then transferred to better approximate the real data. Bounding boxes for the objects in the generated images are automatically labeled after the image adaption.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, there have been some works trying to solve this problem by generating synthetic training data through virtual environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. They render 3D digital models reconstructed or taken from existing dataset using modern computer graphics techniques and create a huge amount of synthetic images by varing the key components in the virtual scene including background texture, lighting, camera parameters, etc. Various training strategies are then adopted to make use of both the synthetic images and the real ones taken in the test environment to enhance the performance of detection. The goal of these approaches is to first make the generated data cover as much sample space as possible and then utilize the real data to compensate for the missing part during training. Although they have proved to be effective on alleviating the insufficient data problem for supervised learning, there still exist some problems:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">First, although a variety of factors have been considered to make the rendered images similar to the real image sets in specific scenarios (eg. the interior of a refrigerator), some challenging factors which usually occur in practical systems were not considered. For example, there are only a limited number of objects overlayed onto a background texture, and the generated images may not be realistic when more objects get involved or pose of the camera changes. Meanwhile, a wide-angle camera with distortions is often employed in practice to make sure all the objects in the scene be captured, while few works have addressed this issue for the generation of such images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, while existing works focus on creating a huge amount of synthetic data and adapt it to the test data set by fusing with the real images during the training process, little efforts have been made to further improve the virtual data itself to make its distribution closer to that of the real data before training. As a result, some synthetic data will be redundant and the performance of the trained network with this data will be limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To solve these problem, we proposed an automatic data generation and adaption method for creating and improving the synthetic data used in the training of object detection in smart vending machines. Different from existing works, we considered more realistic scenes with complex object layout and camera models, and improved the virtually rendered images in the data generation process instead of leaving the data adaption task to the training process. Specifically, we first reconstruct the interior of the vending machine as well as the 3D high-quality models of the real products. Then we put the reconstructed models into the virtual scene with complicated layout and various lighting conditions in order to simulate the real case. We also calibrated the wide-angle camera with distortions and simulate it in the virtual scene. Next we rendered the virtual scenes by permuting the parameters around the true values and varying the objects and environment conditions. After getting the rendered images, we further adapt them to the real images through a generative network. To prove the efficiency of our approach, we conducted a series of experiments on various datasets, and showed that the generated and adapted synthetic data can effectively help to improve the detection precision on existing test sets and also generalize well on new datasets.</p>

These works can be classified into two categories according to the correspondence between the virtual data generation environment and the real test environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For many applications and tasks like robotic control and autonomous driving, it is not quite necessary to require the synthetic training data and test data to have the same distributions. Therefore, the synthetic data can be produced in a virtual environment which is different from the real one. For example, the works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> tried to put the CAD models obtained from public datasets onto complex background textures and render them with arbitrary camera and lighting parameters to create the virtual dataset for the training of object detection. Similar works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> created synthetic images containing cars by rendering existing car models onto natural scene images to help enriching the dataset for the detection and segmentation of cars. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> used digital human models to create synthetic images for pedestrian detection tasks. The CAD models are also used in robotic controls to help training the robot to get the pose of the target to grasp <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. There are also some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed to create a totally virtual 3D environment, from which various data can be generated for different tasks including object detection, semantic segmentation, disparity estimation, etc. The other reason why the simulated data generated has less overlap with the real data in these works is that they targeted on tasks in more general scenes which may differ a lot among one another.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The other type of works try to recover the real scene’s information and then generate the virtual data from the reconstructed virtual scene. For example, there have been some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed to reconstruct the 3D indoor environment and create various types of training data for different tasks. The test of the trained network can be performed on the data collected in the real environment whose amounts are limited though. The works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> used synthetic data for the training of the product recognition tasks in some specific environment like the refrigerator or shelf. The former one used the CAD models which are similar to the real products while the latter used the reconstructed models which have higher precisions. Both of them tried to recover the information of the real environment (such as the camera parameters) and added some perturbations to generate a wider range of synthetic data. However, the layout of their environment is relatively simple and more challenging factors like complicated camera model and object poses were not addressed. Meanwhile, they chose to handle fix the gap between the virtual and real data in the training process, leading to the generation of huge number of redundant data.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The detection of the objects in a complex environment involves the simulation of both the objects and the background.

First, each type of object is reconstructed to recover the geometry and texture information. Next, the 3D models of the objects are placed randomly in a reconstructed virtual scene. After setting the virtual lightings, the whole virtual environment can then be rendered with a virtual camera whose intrinsic parameters are obtained by calibrating the real camera in the machine. Virtual-to-real image transfer is further implemented to make the synthetic images approximate the real ones better, and labeling is finally done automatically. More synthetic images of the training set can be obtained by varying the parameters of the 3D virtual scene(number and types of objects, lighting types and parameters, background textures, etc.).</p>

The scanner adopts the RGB and structural light cameras for the acquisition of the color and depth information respectively, and it is not able to accurately reconstruct objects with specular or transparent materials. To solve this problem, we used the method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to first transform the specular material into a diffuse with a deep neural network to proceed the reconstruction, and restore the specular material afterwards. As there is still a lack of stable method for the automatic reconstruction of transparent objects, we did not include that type of objects during the experiments. Although this could be alleviated by introducing some manual works, it is beyond the scope of this paper and therefore not discussed here. The reconstructed model is represented as a dense triangular mesh. whose bounding box is calculated for the use of arranging the layout of the objects on the virtual holding plane later.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After the objects have been reconstructed, they will be placed into a virtual environment which simulates that interior of a real vending machine. Here we used the BundleFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to reconstruct the interior structure and textures of the vending machine and further refined it with the method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. The virtual scene together with the reconstructed objects will then be rendered with a virtual camera to generate the synthetic images. We use the Unity3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> engine to build up the whole virtual environment and render the images. There are some key factors involved in this process: the layout of the environment and objects, the camera parameters, and the lightings.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to the real environment, the layout of the virtual one generally has a cuboid shape consisting of a flat holding plane for placing the objects.

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">An important task here is to place the objects on the holding plane in an efficient manner. For the ease of implementing the detection and classification, we allow two general poses of the objects: the standing pose and the lying pose. For the former pose, all objects are made to stand on the holding plane with tops facing the camera, and for the latter one, they are placed to lie on the plane with side views facing the camera. To place the objects with either standing pose or lying pose onto the holding plane, we simplify the problem into placing the excircles of the top or side views of the objects into a rectangle area. The excircles can be easily computed from the bounding boxes of the models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To solve this problem, we adopted a brute force method by setting the textures of the object whose bounds are to be computed to white and the textures of the other objects to black. The background texture is also set to black and all lightings are disabled. The scene will then be rendered and a distorted image with only the visible part of the target object can be obtained. The bounding rectangle can then be calculated with the contour of the white area. As the rendering will become much easier after setting the textures to simple colors and disabling the lights, this computation is quite fast and can be completed in real time.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It can be seen that the utilization of the synthetic images during the training improved the performance on the training set remarkably. Among the three algorithms, PVANET achieves the best performance, and the mAP increases nearly 2 percentages with the use of the same number of generated data. This proves that our data generation and adaption method effectively simulated the data distribution in the real environment. It is also worth noting that the precision does not improve much when the number of synthetic images reaches that of the real ones, as the data distribution has been well simulated with that quantity of synthetic data, and more data will not help to enrich that distribution obviously.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the effectiveness of the data adaption step in our algorithm, we also trained the PVANET algorithm on datasets containing images generated with and without the style transfer step. Similarly, we combined the real images with 500 bounding boxes per object with synthetic images containing 50, 100, 200, 500, 700 bounding boxes (with and without the style transfer) respectively for the training set. The trained models are also evaluated on the same test set in previous experiment. The mAP results are shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-B Evaluations ‣ IV Experimental evaluation ‣ Synthetic Data Generation and Adaption for Object Detection in Smart Vending Machines" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. It can be seen that the precision of models trained on images with data adaption obviously outperforms those trained on rendered images without further adaption. It is also noted that the result of the data adaption method is able to approach optimal with a quantity of only 200 bounding boxes of each object, while it requires 500 for the generated data without adaption. This proves that our data adaption method can effectively transfer the data distribution of the synthetic images to that of that of the images captured in real environment, and less generated data is thus required, which makes the data generation more effective and less time-consuming.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We also conducted another experiment on a new test set to test the generalization capability of the models trained on the generated images. Specifically, we collected 220 images on the fourth layer of the cabinet, on which the same 10 types of objects are placed and there are also about 500 bounding boxes for each type. PVANET which achieves the best performance is also adopted here. We compared the test results of models trained with the real images of 500 bounding boxes for each object type and the mixed image sets containing 200 synthetic images with and without data adaption. The result is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IV-B Evaluations ‣ IV Experimental evaluation ‣ Synthetic Data Generation and Adaption for Object Detection in Smart Vending Machines" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. It can be seen that the mAP of models trained on mixed data with initially rendered images has shifted to 85, thanks to the wider range of sampling space covered by the generated images than that of the images taken in the first three layers. The style transfer step further helped to improved the precision to nearly 89. This proves the generalization ability of the models trained with our data generation and adaption method.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">From the above evaluation results, it can be seen that by mixing the data generated with our method with a limited number of the real images as the training data, the precision of object detection can be remarkably enhanced in not only the current environment, but also a new environment which has distinct background, lighting and layout conditions. This proves that our data generation and adaption method is able to compensate for the shortage of training data in image object detection tasks, and effectively avoids the resources spent on redundant data generation.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented an automatic data synthesis scheme which is able to produce photo-realistic virtual images of the interior of vending machines for the sake of complementing the training data for object detection within it. Our method is able to simulate the real environment with complex object layout and wide-angle camera with distortions. A novel generative network is further adopted to transfer the intrinsic features of the real images to the synthetic data before the training process such that they will share more common space in terms of data distribution. Experimental results proved that our method is effective on enhancing the object detection precision with the enriched training data and generalizes well into the datasets of new environment.</p>
