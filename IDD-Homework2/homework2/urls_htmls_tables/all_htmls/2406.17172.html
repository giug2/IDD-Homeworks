<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces a robust zero-trust architecture (ZTA) tailored for the decentralized system that empowers efficient remote work and collaboration within IoT networks. Using blockchain-based federated learning principles, our proposed framework includes a robust aggregation mechanism designed to counteract malicious updates from compromised clients, enhancing the security of the global learning process. Moreover, secure and reliable trust computation is essential for remote work and collaboration. The robust ZTA framework integrates anomaly detection and trust computation, ensuring secure and reliable device collaboration in a decentralized fashion. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts to varying user contexts, using unsupervised clustering to detect novel anomalies, like zero-day attacks. To ensure a reliable and scalable trust computation, we develop an algorithm that dynamically adapts to varying user contexts by employing incremental anomaly detection and clustering techniques to identify and share local and global anomalies between nodes. Future directions include scalability improvements, Dirichlet process for advanced anomaly detection, privacy-preserving techniques, and the integration of post-quantum cryptographic methods to safeguard against emerging quantum threats.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the post-quantum era, the landscape of remote computation, online collaboration, and work-from-home (WFH) has transformed dramatically. Leading cloud service providers, such as Amazon S3 and Azure Blobs, have made these capabilities standard, reflecting their importance. Astonishingly, 89% of corporate data uploaded to the cloud is now associated with remote collaboration and file sharing. This shift requires a reevaluation of traditional network security concepts, especially perimeter-based security. The widespread adoption of cloud services and remote work has effectively dissolved physical network boundaries, calling for innovative security strategies to protect our increasingly virtualized work environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional perimeter-based security approaches, such as enterprise firewalls, are increasingly inadequate. They struggle to: (i) effectively counteract malicious actors within the network perimeter, and (ii) provide sufficient protection for remote users, devices, and services outside the network perimeter. This shift underscores the urgent need for security architectures that are independent of both the perimeter and location.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The Zero Trust Access Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rose
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. ZTA fundamentally rethinks network security by assuming that the infrastructure is compromised and focuses on minimizing uncertainty in enforcing precise, least-privilege, per-request access decisions. It emphasizes situational awareness, dynamic authentication and authorization, fine-grained access control, small trust zones, and continuous trust evaluation. The literature on federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pokhrel and Choi, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> is quite rich, including that to enable security; however, its utilization to operationalize ZTA is poorly studied in the literature. Pokhrel et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pokhrel
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> proposed a decentralized ZTA (dZTA); however, implementing these principles effectively and securely in large-scale enterprises or cyberphysical infrastructures, without compromising resource availability or dynamic control over network assets, remains a significant challenge that demands innovative and collaborative intelligence-driven solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pokhrel, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>.</p>

This approach presents a promising vision for network security, focusing on users, assets, and resources rather than solely on network access. In Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1.

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, researchers have focused on two key ideas in the past decade: anonymity (masking user identities from the server) and verifiable consistency (allowing users to detect forks and rollbacks). However, current ZTA deployment strategies, including the NIST framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rose
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, also rely heavily on centralized servers, presenting similar security challenges such as active attacks and single point of failure. Some approaches assume that adversaries are curious but not malicious <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Maffei et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Buccafurri et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, or they rely on a trusted party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Maffei et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and split the server into components assuming one is honest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karapanos

Yet, a persistent attacker can often compromise even these divided central servers, as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kim and Lie, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Mazieres and
Shasha, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>)</cite>, because devices cannot detect fork attacks without trusting the server to some extent if they are not reliable online.</p>

</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A critical question that arises in this context is: Can strong security be achieved without depending on centralized trust in remote collaborative WFH systems? To address this, we designed a robust decentralized deployment framework for ZTA, focusing on distributed policy monitoring, trust computation, and continuous authentication. The primary objectives, as outlined in the NIST special publication on ZTA (August 2020), are to prevent data breaches and limit internal lateral movement. This paper aims to develop a fully decentralized and robust deployment of ZTA for trusted remote working and collaboration. Our framework is scalable, efficient, and provably secure, minimizing opportunities for lateral movement by both malicious and nonmalicious actors. This novel approach involves developing new algorithms for distributed trust computation and anomaly detection.</p>

A predefined interval is set for periodic updates. Each node clusters its flow data using a clustering algorithm. This process involves running the clustering algorithm on each node’s data (flow records) to identify patterns and group similar data points. Each node identifies local anomalies based on distance metrics and computes local anomaly scores. This helps in detecting deviations from normal behavior at the individual node level.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Local cluster information is shared between nodes using the blockchain protocol. If the blockchain protocol is not feasible, point-to-point communication between neighboring nodes is used to ensure that local clustering information is distributed throughout the network. Global clusters are calculated from the local cluster information for each node, and global anomalies are identified from these global clusters. This step aggregates data from all nodes to provide a comprehensive view of the network’s behavior.</p>

Global clusters are computed from this shared information, allowing the identification of global anomalies and the calculation of trust values for each node. This entire process is repeated at regular intervals or on demand, ensuring that trust values are continually updated and stored in the blockchain.

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We first consider scenarios where devices might fail, such as during a power outage, with and without blockchain support. Without blockchain, the failure of a central server significantly impacts the accuracy of learning. Our proposed Robust Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) based on the BFL algorithm, which incorporates blockchain support, outperforms the baseline FL algorithms that lack blockchain support. In the Google FL approach, an unexpected central server failure severely degrades the accuracy of the learning. In contrast, our framework leverages blockchain to enable devices to act as global aggregators, maintaining global aggregation even if some devices fail.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, the complexity and diversity of network architectures can lead to malicious updates from participating devices. The decoupling of the local training process from the server opens the possibility of poisoning attacks. In our second experiment, we assume the presence of malicious devices within the network attempting to degrade the performance of the local model and contaminate the global model. We simulated 10 malicious devices and evaluated the performance of our proposed aggregation mechanism. The results, shown in Figures <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.3.

With 10 indexed devices, in each communication round, we randomly designate 1 to 3 clients as malicious nodes, executing a total of 20 rounds, as detailed in Table 1. We can see that even with the vast majority of nodes remaining honest, the impact of poisoning attacks is evident. The modified local gradients stand out as anomalies compared to the normal ones. However, as the number of malicious nodes increases, some forged gradients manage to bypass the detection mechanism, leading to a decrease in the detection rate.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have presented a robust decentralized Zero Trust Architecture framework underpinned by a blockchain-enabled federated learning (BFL) approach. Our framework addresses critical challenges in secure remote work and collaboration by ensuring reliable trust computation, dynamic context adaptation, and robust anomaly detection. By leveraging blockchain technology, our proposed method mitigates the risks associated with central server failures and malicious model updates, providing a resilient and secure learning environment. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our BFL algorithm compared to traditional federated learning approaches, particularly in scenarios involving device failures and poisoning attacks.</p>
