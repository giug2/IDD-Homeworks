<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning involves training statistical models over edge devices such as mobile phones such that the training data is kept local. Federated Learning (FL) can serve as an ideal candidate for training spatial temporal models that rely on heterogeneous and potentially massive numbers of participants while preserving the privacy of highly sensitive location data. However, there are unique challenges involved with transitioning existing spatial temporal models to decentralized learning. In this survey paper, we review the existing literature that has proposed FL-based models for predicting human mobility, traffic prediction, community detection, location-based recommendation systems, and other spatial-temporal tasks. We describe the metrics and datasets these works have been using and create a baseline of these approaches in comparison to the centralized settings. Finally, we discuss the challenges of applying spatial-temporal models in a decentralized setting and by highlighting the gaps in the literature we provide a road map and opportunities for the research community.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Spatio-temporal mobility data collected by location-based services (LBS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> and other means such as Call Data Records (CDR), WiFi hotspots, smart watches, cars, etc. is very useful from a socio-economical perspective as it is at the heart of many useful applications (e.g., navigation, geo-located search, geo-located games) and it allows answering numerous societal research questions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>. For example, CDR has been successfully used to provide real-time traffic anomaly as well as event detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>, <a href="#bib.bib134" title="" class="ltx_ref">134</a>]</cite>, and a variety of mobility datasets have been used in shaping policies for urban communities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> or epidemic management in the public health domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>]</cite>. From an individual-level perspective, users can benefit from personalized recommendations when they are encouraged to share their location data with third parties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While there is no doubt about the usefulness of location-based applications, privacy concerns regarding the collection and sharing of individuals’ mobility traces or aggregated flow of movements have prevented the data from being utilized to their full potential <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>. A mobility privacy study conducted by De Montjoye et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> illustrates that four spatio-temporal points are enough to identify 95% of the individuals, which exacerbates the user re-identification risk and could be the origin of many unexpected privacy leakages. Indeed, various studies have shown that numerous threats arise if location data falls into the hands of inappropriate parties. These threats include re-identification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite>, the inference of sensitive information about users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>, <a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>]</cite>(e.g., their home and work locations, religious beliefs, political interests or sexual orientation). In some extreme cases, sharing geo-located data may even endanger users’ physical integrity (e.g., the identification of protesters in dictatorial regimes or during wars<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ukraine-ap-russia-gps-kyiv-b2093310.html</span></span></span>) or their belongings (e.g., robbery<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>https://pleaserobme.com</span></span></span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One way to consider addressing privacy challenges is to break from centralized data collection and maintain the location data on user devices. In this decentralized paradigm, a variety of solutions are plausible. A possible approach is to create accurate enough synthetic location data to train spatial-temporal models and then fine-tune them on users’ devices to perform best for the individuals’ location data. Although this is a promising approach, the research has shown that mobility trajectory generation is an extremely difficult task that may not portray data heterogeneity accurately <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>, <a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite>. Moreover, trajectories from different locations, periods, or user groups may have distinct characteristics that the pre-trained model does not handle effectively. Although this is an ongoing field of research, to date there exists little evidence as to whether models can transfer mobility knowledge across cities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>, as with a significant distribution shift between the data used for pre-training and the data for the target task, transfer learning may not generalize well.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In parallel, an alternative approach that is increasingly considered a promising approach is Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">102</a>]</cite>. FL relies on clients (be it users’ smartphones or edge devices) to train a machine learning model on their local training data and share the model weights with a central server (called the FL server) that aggregates the received clients’ contributions. As such, FL empowers clients by allowing them to benefit from a globally trained model while keeping their private data on their premises. Compared with other applications of FL, spatial-temporal data and models possess certain characteristics and properties that introduce challenges. For instance, in domains involving ST data, the observations made at nearby times and locations cannot hold the independent property due to the auto-correlation (e.g., changes in traffic activity occur smoothly over time and space). As a result, classical FL algorithms that assume independence among observations are not suited for ST applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, ST data is not identically distributed, that is it does not meet the assumption that every instance belongs to the same population and is thus identically distributed. These two properties are referred to as <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">iid</span> (independent and identically distributed). Additionally, ST data is often both spatially and or temporally sparse and often created at high frequencies, especially in real-time applications, resulting in a high velocity and volume of data generation.</p>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since FL emerged half a decade ago, many survey papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>, <a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>, <a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>]</cite> have reviewed relevant literature from various perspectives. In 2023 alone, 91 surveys on federated learning were published with the majority being on applications-specific topics, predominantly focused on health, finance, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> presents the growing number of application-specific FL surveys and in parallel the emergence of papers on FL-ST topics<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>Our methodology in harvesting data about all survey papers on FL is outlined in the Appendix.</span></span></span>.
In motivating the need for this survey, we discuss the perspectives that IoT-related and generic FL surveys have covered and highlight their shortcomings when applied to ST models. More specifically, FL Surveys on smart cities including those of IoT applications are closest to our work. Zheng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib166" title="" class="ltx_ref">166</a>]</cite> reviewed applications of FL in smart cities. They provided a broad overview of various applications of smart cities including IoT, transportation, communication, medical care, and finance. They created a glossary of the papers in these domains without discussing the diversity of existing approaches or drawing comparisons between these works. Their work mainly focused on security and privacy challenges and outlined algorithmic efficiency as a future direction but did not consider the heterogeneity and sparsity often associated with the location data. The closest survey to ours is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>]</cite> which has a subsection discussing the FL transportation application in smart cities. However, they focus on car navigation, number plate recognition, railway, and infrastructure systems and reviewed 6 papers in this domain out of which only one falls in the focus of our survey.</p>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Other FL surveys that are <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">not</span> application-specific and review methodological approaches of FL regarding heterogeneity, model convergence, and personalization fall short in drawing a comparison between these different techniques when applied to ST data. Although some of the challenges such as non-iid are well covered in those surveys, the other characteristics of the ST data are not covered. Finally, we note that despite its unique properties and the increasing number of spatial-temporal research papers emerging in FL (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), no survey paper has attempted to categorize, review, and compare this emergent of ST FL methodological approaches.</p>

In FL, a global (joint) model is trained in a decentralized fashion without the need to collect and process user data centrally. The central service provider, often called aggregator, distributes a shared ML model to multiple users for training on local data, and then aggregates the resulting models into a single, more powerful model, using an aggregation method (<span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>, Federated Averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite>).

Based on the order of magnitude of the number of participants and the assumptions regarding their computational capabilities, two FL settings are distinguished in this paper: cross-device FL (CD FL) and cross-silo FL (CS FL).</p>

<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">CD FL typically refers to scenarios where the number of users is in the order of millions of individuals, each possessing limited and heterogeneous computational resources (<span id="S2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>, personal laptops, cell phones). In contrast, cross-silo FL operates at a (much) smaller scale of the number of users, representing each a large entity (<span id="S2.p7.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>, hospitals, cellular operators, and data centers), with substantial computational capabilities.

<p id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Model Personalization on the other hand refers to the process of assigning different model parameters (weights) to different clients. The objective behind this is twofold: i) improve the global model’s individual performance and ii) mitigate the impact of non-iid property. To this end, various methodologies have emerged. One approach involves incorporating context features into the model during training, known as personalization through featurization. Another technique, meta-learning, focuses on adapting the global model to the local learning task. In its simplest form, it boils down to fine-tuning the global model or a subset of layers of it. Understanding what level of generalization can be learned globally and what layers of the models need to be personalized locally is an active area of research.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to these challenges, there are specific considerations within the realm of spatio-temporal mobility applications. These include: 1) the constraints on client resources, 2) the online learning setting - specifically, whether clients train while simultaneously collecting/creating data, and 3) the comparison of solutions with at least one federated competitor, aside from standalone FL. This comprehensive evaluation framework has allowed us to conduct a meta-comparison, analyzing the strengths and limitations of the main works within each approach (Refer to <a href="#S4.T4" title="In 4.1.1 Federated Trajectory Predictive Approaches ‣ 4.1 Trajectory Predictive Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Tables</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.2.1 Grid based Approaches ‣ 4.2 Traffic Flow Prediction Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, <a href="#S4.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 4.2.2 GNN Based Approaches ‣ 4.2 Traffic Flow Prediction Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> and <a href="#S4.T10" title="Table 10 ‣ 4.3 Top-N Location-Based Recommendation Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>).

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As Federated Learning (FL) establishes itself as the standard machine learning paradigm, numerous frameworks have emerged to offer scalable and flexible solutions for privacy-preserving machine learning in distributed settings. Selecting an appropriate FL framework for designing new algorithms is a non-trivial task. Therefore, in this section, we define specific criteria to facilitate the selection process of an FL framework. The following criteria will be considered:</p>

As privacy stands as a central motivation for FL, it is imperative to recognize that standalone FL lacks privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite>. Within this context, various privacy technologies are under design, including cryptographic tools like Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), secret sharing, formal models such as Differential Privacy (DP), and hardware-based techniques like Trusted-Execution Environments (TEEs). Evaluating which of these tools an FL framework supports is crucial due to the complexity of integrating them.</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Mobility prediction can be defined as algorithms and techniques to estimate the future locations of users. Predicting the next location of users can help with a range of applications including networking (e.g., handover management), pandemic management (e.g., contact tracing), etc. This type of prediction is performed on individual users’ traces where the historical trend of the user’s visited locations can help in predicting the likelihood of their next location.</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rising availability of transportation data collected from various sensors like road cameras, GPS probes, and IoT devices, there is an enormous opportunity for city planners to leverage these types of data to facilitate various tasks such as traffic flow prediction. Different from <span id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">trajectory</span> data that records a sequence of locations and time in each trip, crowd flow data only have the start and end locations of a trip, and how many people flow in and out of a particular region can be counted. Indeed, traffic flow prediction using spatial-temporal data has been one of the main focuses of the research community (See comprehensive survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>). In the context of transportation, this problem is often considered as forecasting which is to predict traffic speed or traffic flow of regions or road segments based on historical aggregated mobility data.</p>

<div id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Community detection is an important aspect of urban planning as it allows researchers and planners to identify patterns and trends in human movement. By identifying groups of individuals or locations that are highly connected, researchers and planners can gain insight into how people move through a city, which can inform the design of transportation systems and urban spaces. Additionally, community detection can help identify areas of a city that are at risk of overcrowding or under-utilization, allowing for proactive measures to be taken to address these issues. The underlying enabler of identifying urban communities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> is spatial temporal data that presents the amount of time spent in different parts of the city. Researchers have shown that human mobility exhibits a strong degree of non-linearity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and models that rely on non-linear clustering algorithms, such as the one proposed by Ferreira et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, to detect urban communities have been shown to outperform traditional approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Model-Based Clustering (MBC) and DB-SCAN techniques on a variety of centralized geospatial traces.</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">LBSNs such as Foursquare and Flickr are social networks that use GPS features to locate the users and let the users broadcast their locations and other content from their mobile devices. LBSNs do not merely mean that the locations are added to the user-generated content (UGC) in social networks so that people can share their location information but also reshape the social structure among individual users that are connected by both their locations in the physical world and their location-tagged social media content in the virtual world. LBSNs contain a large number of user check-in data which consists of the instant locations of each user. Such social networks could also be thought of as the underlying application of Location-based recommendation systems.</p>

In a centralized setting where the training data containing all users’ trajectories are available, RNN-based approaches including LSTM and GRU can be broadly applied in dealing with trajectories and predictive tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>]</cite>.
As this type of data (i.e., trajectory) is highly privacy sensitive, one of the challenges that the research community has been focusing on creating models that can be tuned for privacy and utility, namely, PUTs (Privacy-Utility Tradeoff). Models such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib150" title="" class="ltx_ref">150</a>, <a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> leverage the centralized training data to enhance the privacy level of the traces by reducing user’s re-identification and at the same time optimizing for the utility of the predictions (i.e., higher accuracy of next point predictions).</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The challenges of trajectory predictive approaches in decentralized learning are different. Firstly, the unique properties of people’s mobility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> lead to a non-iid distribution of the data amongst clients. Second and as a result of the first challenge, creating a global model for predicting the next location of users that works equally well for all the users becomes an extremely challenging task. That is one must decide to what extent should clients adopt the global model and when to opt-in for a purely personalized model. In this section we review the existing works in this domain, review how they account for the mentioned challenge, and compare their performances in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.1 Trajectory Predictive Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> against centralized predictive approaches namely ST-RNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>]</cite>, MCARNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>]</cite>, DeepMove <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, and VANext <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.</p>

In this application domain, the non-iid nature stemming from a substantial number of users, each with unique characteristics, as well as privacy considerations, takes precedence over other challenges. Notably, while the former challenge appears to have been adequately addressed by the majority of the reviewed works, the latter has only been specifically tackled by<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. In addition, it is noteworthy that most works have not taken into account federated competitors, preventing a comprehensive evaluation of their impact. This concern is pivotal not only for the current task but for all spatio-temporal mobility FL, as elaborated in  <a href="#S5.SS5" title="5.5 Standardisation and Reproducibility ‣ 5 Discussion and open research challenges ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.5</span></a>. Similar apprehensions extend to the robustness against Byzantine behaviors. However, this criterion holds less significance in the context of CD FL compared to the CS FL setting, as is the case for the next discussed approach. In the following, we delve into a more comprehensive discussion of these works.</p>

In the group optimization procedure, the whole model is divided into the risky group trained with protected data and the secure group trained with normal data.

In this realm, the focus shifts towards understanding and dissecting individuals’ personal transportation modes, a facet that holds paramount importance in the efficient management of public transportation systems. Particularly in bustling metropolis cities marked by substantial populations and heavy traffic volumes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite>.

We use Shannon’s Entropy <math id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="H(x)" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml">H</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">x</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2"><times id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.2.2">𝐻</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑥</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.2.m2.1c">H(x)</annotation></semantics></math> to get a sense of both the sparsity and non-iidness of several check-in datasets. In this process, we adjust the metric proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite> to extend the individual entropy of users (i.e., horizontal) with an individual entropy of point-of-interests (i.e., vertical). We argue that having these two dimensions for the entropy is necessary to draw conclusions w.r.t to sparsity and heterogeneity. To quantify this relationship, we first measure the horizontal entropy in the following manner:</p>

In fact, Subfigure <a href="#S4.F3.sf1" title="Figure 3(a) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 4.1.3 Datasets ‣ 4.1 Trajectory Predictive Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a> even shows that a significant proportion of Brightkite users have zero entropy, indicating that some users have only one check-in. This correlates with the high sparsity levels of the dataset (refer to Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.1.3 Datasets ‣ 4.1 Trajectory Predictive Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). This downward trend is also evident when viewed through the lens of vertical entropy, although it may be less pronounced. Considering these observations, we see this dataset as an appropriate option to tackle the sparsity problem in distributed learning on mobility data.
Conversely, Weeplaces exhibits two important trends: Firstly, there is a considerably higher level of horizontal entropy compared to what is seen on Brightkite, without a corresponding increase in vertical entropy. This suggests that in general users are more active and less predictable, but have not explored a much wider spectrum of points-of-interest. Secondly, Figure <a href="#S4.F3.sf1" title="Figure 3(a) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 4.1.3 Datasets ‣ 4.1 Trajectory Predictive Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a> exhibits a significant number of user outliers, particularly those with low entropy, indicating the presence of a short tail.

Oppositely, Gowalla exhibits more horizontal entropy, which indicates that users are more active globally while also having a higher vertical entropy, indicating that users have substantially less in common than in WeePlaces. These two observations suggest a more heterogeneous, yet less sparse dataset. This makes Gowalla a perfect candidate for works tackling heterogeneity. However, the presence of a significant proportion of highly mobile outlier users should also be noted. Finally, Foursquare datasets show good entropy levels on both axes, making them an excellent choice for sanity tests.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP) is a problem with multifarious applications. For instance, it allows to mitigate traffic, evaluate air pollution, estimate travel time, and improve driving experience. Approaches in predicting the traffic patterns range from parametric approaches, which are based on statistical metrics (<span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>, ARIMA ), to more advanced ML models such as those based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). For a comprehensive survey of deep learning models for traffic predictions in centralized settings refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. Flow prediction approaches require slightly different settings in FL than trajectory prediction. Unlike individual predictive approaches where each client is assumed to correspond to an individual with their mobility traces, in flow predictive approaches, the clients are often considered to be entities or organizations that are maintaining their flow data private to comply with privacy regulations. Considering this, Cross Silo FL appears as a promising paradigm for ensuring that records are not shared outside of each organization/sensor. Moreover, as the number of clients is smaller, and the datasets sizes per client is greater, this configuration alleviates some of the non-iidness concerns. However, this paradigm shift also ushers in two pivotal challenges: First, The nature of traffic flow prediction demands real-time adaptation due to the highly dynamic nature of the data. Consequently, the FL process cannot afford to wait until a significant data pool accumulates. Implementing online learning strategies becomes imperative to continuously update the model with incoming data streams. Second, the units responsible of collecting the data (<span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>, sensors) often grapple with limited computational and spatial resources. Crafting efficient solutions becomes crucial to ensure the practicality of these solutions and their adaptability to real world applications. In the following, we categorize TFP works into two groups, depending on the types of models employed : grid-based approaches relying temporal models (<span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>, RNNs, LSTM, etc.) and graph-based approaches employing GCNs. We first compare the literature on a high level before diving deeper into each work. We then introduce the metrics and datasets used for this task.</p>

Moreover, with the exception of two notable works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib104" title="" class="ltx_ref">104</a>, <a href="#bib.bib148" title="" class="ltx_ref">148</a>]</cite>, the overhead imposed by the proposed solutions remains largely unquantified. Furthermore, the current array of works largely overlooks the critical aspect of robustness—neglecting to account for potential vulnerabilities wherein sensors may transmit compromised model updates due to malicious interference or system faults.</p>

They design a long short-term memory (LSTM) model as the local training model for joint prediction of vehicular speed and traffic flow. A unique characteristic of FedTSE is that it relies on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to adjust model parameter uploading/downloading decisions such that it improves the estimation accuracy of local models and balances the tradeoff between computation and communication cost. They evaluate their approach on the England Freeway Dataset which includes flow and speed for the entire year of 2014. They also consider three different aggregation strategies corresponding to a synchronous aggregation with the same number of epochs per client, namely, <span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedTSE-Syn</span>; an asynchronous aggregation with different numbers of epochs, namely, <span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedTSE-Asyn</span> and a weighted vrsion of FedTSE-Asyn where clients that have trained more are given more weight.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To our knowledge, this work stands as the sole work introducing a multi-task learning method for the TFP challenge within the FL framework. The motivation behind this approach is to craft personalized models capable of adjusting to the diverse forms of heterogeneity previously outlined (See Section<a href="#S2" title="2 Federated Learning ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). The authors’ methodology begins with a hierarchical clustering of clients’ (<span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ie</span>, sensors) local data based on various criteria such as weather conditions, time, and special events. This clustering ensures the presence of consistent clusters across clients. Subsequently, an LSTM model is trained in a federated manner for each cluster to capture temporal features and address time travel prediction. This process yields a dynamic graph delineating sub-segments connecting different stations, along with their respective travel times—this graph evolves over time. Interestingly, the authors propose a modification of the <math id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A^{*}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">A</mi><mo id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">∗</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐴</ci><times id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"></times></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.Px7.p1.1.m1.1c">A^{*}</annotation></semantics></math> algorithm to determine the optimal route utilizing this time-dependent graph.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, the authors propose a comprehensive solution to address the efficiency of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in handling spatial correlations, a critical aspect of traffic flow data. Previous methods, particularly those not based on graph models, rely on individual clients learning on their local view of the system, leading to a neglect of spatial associations of the traffic network’s topology. To overcome this limitation, the authors introduce GraphFed, a carefully devised algorithm aimed at enhancing communication efficiency while preserving the ability to capture spatial correlations. The key innovation lies in the division of the graph network into sub-graphs, with representative clients randomly selected for each sub-graph. These representatives aggregate data from all clients within their respective sub-graphs, facilitating the classification of the model’s parameters into global and local categories, the latter being tailored specifically to spatial relationships.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Importantly, the practicality of GraphFed is evident as it mitigates the need to store the entire traffic network at the client level, a cumbersome requirement for large traffic networks. By operating on disjoint regions of the traffic network, representative clients efficiently avoid the necessity of sharing local parameters with the Federated Learning (FL) server, ensuring that only global parameters are learned in a federated manner, thereby minimizing communication overhead. The authors also adopt the ADGCN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite>, enhancing its efficiency by refining the convolution operation.

To accomplish this task, authors proposed a Graph-based Representation Learning for CS FL using three main modules: a Recurrent Long-term capture Network (RLCN) module, an Attentive Mechanism Federated Network (AMFN) Module, and a Semantic Capture Network module (SCN). The RLCN module is responsible for learning long-term traffic behaviors as geometric time series data of fixed long-term interval <math id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">p</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑝</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px4.p1.1.m1.1c">p</annotation></semantics></math>.

Lastly, there is the SCN module, which takes into account Point of Interest Feature Components (POI) and non-euclidean connection relationships. Points of interest and their interactions have significant effects on TFP but are not incorporated into the raw time series prediction data. Furthermore, transportation networks also have methods of connection outside adjacent-grid connections, such as trains, highways, etc. These flows also have an important effect on TFP that is not incorporated elsewhere, so this module is to address this issue. The output of all these modules is then connected via an FC layer followed by a Tanh activation function for the final output.</p>

On each training step, the server processes a temporal encoding update, a partial gradient update, and an on-node graph embedding update. Each iteration updates the client side weights and then ships the model, hidden layer, and gradients back to the server.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.Px5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One large issue of the proposed approach is the communication overhead in the training stage, with split learning requiring the global model to fetch all hidden states from each node, and ship gradients of node embeddings to each node. Then, it must receive gradients of node embedding and send gradients of hidden states in the back-propagation step. To mitigate this, they propose an alternative training approach in which the temporal encoder-decoder and the node embeddings are trained separately. First, the node embeddings are fixed and optimization is performed on the encoder-decoder. Then, after a fixed interval, the global model is updated fixing the node-level models. This drastically reduces communication overhead.
The FL local models and the GNN model with only a local objective function. They perform alternating optimization to update clients’ model weights with GNN model weights fixed and then update GNN model weights with the FL local model weights fixed, over multiple rounds.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Location-based recommendation task, while resembling trajectory prediction, often entail lower demands. This task involve identifying a top-K set of relevant Points of Interest (POIs) for a user based on their historical POIs. In Table <a href="#S4.T10" title="Table 10 ‣ 4.3 Top-N Location-Based Recommendation Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, we summarize the challenges addressed by the community for this use case. Notably, none of the reviewed works have considered an online learning setting. One might argue that this task may not necessarily require online learning because users’ preferences might not significantly change over time, unlike the trajectory prediction task, which inherently encompasses a natural time dimension. However, we argue that exploring online learning could still be valuable. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated that users’ preferences tend to evolve over time. While other challenges have been reasonably explored, it’s noteworthy that several works have based their privacy solutions on not sharing all model parameters, but recent studies on similar models have shown this approach not to be entirely private <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib159" title="" class="ltx_ref">159</a>, <a href="#bib.bib146" title="" class="ltx_ref">146</a>]</cite>. This is indicated in the table using the "<math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\approx" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">≈</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><approx id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"></approx></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\approx</annotation></semantics></math>" symbol. Finally, similar to previous approaches/tasks, the exploration of robustness has been lacking. This is unfortunate, given that issues like shilling attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> are significant concerns for recommendation systems and represent just one type of robustness concern not explored in this federated setting. Other types include malicious users fabricating fake profiles to manipulate recommendations, promote specific POIs, and introduce unfairness.</p>

To address this issue, researchers have proposed mainly three approaches: i) "a share less" policy, ii) injecting noise using techniques like Differential Privacy (DP), and iii) using cryptographic methods like Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). Various studies have proposed solutions using each of these approaches, but each approach has its limitations.
For instance,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed sharing only user-independent embeddings to be learned in a federated manner while training user embeddings locally. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> first proposed a practical attack, demonstrating that user check-ins can be easily inferred by a curious FL server based on POIs embeddings. Later on, they proposed to alleviate this attack by training these embeddings on noisy data generated using DP. They show that if the rest of the network (i.e., non-sensitive layers) is frozen during this noisy training, and is pre-trained on real data, then the performance remains reasonable. Nevertheless, they did not quantify the impact of their attack nor the degree of protection provided by their solution. Another line of work,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite>, opts for the third approach and uses SMPC to hide the individual contributions of the users from a curious FL server. Unfortunately, this approach opens the door to malicious users, whose goal would be to corrupt the learning, and who would be difficult to detect due to SMPC.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A more privacy-oriented solution was proposed by  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. They aggregated less sensitive embeddings using SMPC and categorized sensitive embeddings into two parts: those related to POIs and those related to users. They used Local DP to add noise at the user level to the POI-related embeddings before sharing them with the server. They also proposed to share the user-dependent embeddings in a peer-to-peer fashion using secret sharing. To reduce overhead and the attack surface, they considered geographic information to build the peer neighborhood. Thus, a user shares its sensitive embeddings only with geographically close neighbors. This solution has competitive prediction performances with non-private solutions and undeniably provides more privacy guarantees. However, the impact of the assumption that sensitive embeddings can be safely shared with nearby users is still unclear.

<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another type of attack that has received significant attention in recent mobility research is re-identification attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. The fundamental concept behind such attacks is that a malicious service provider could exploit background knowledge to associate anonymized user traces with their respective owners, thereby compromising users’ anonymity. To address this issue, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citeauthor"><a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">Khalfoun et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span></a></cite> proposed a federated protocol for assessing the risk of re-identification on mobility data. This protocol involves training a re-identification model in a federated manner using users’ traces and subsequently utilizing this model to select the optimal combination and hyperparameters of location privacy protection mechanisms (LPPMs) that can protect a user’s privacy whenever they transmit their data to an untrusted Mobile Crowd Sensing Server (MCS). Notably, this solution appears to be the only privacy risk assessment mechanism for mobility data that does not necessitate the presence of a trusted curator, to the best of our knowledge.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the biggest opportunities that we see in continuing research on location and point trajectory predicting, is in regards to integrating more semantic and contextual information about types of places instead of focusing primarily on coordinates.
For example, this contextual information can include information on whether a point in trajectory represents someone’s workplace, their frequently visited locations, or a potential point of interest in a new town.
While this is not limited to FL applications and previous works have often used open source maps to infer information about the type of places (e.g., popularity, socio-economic level), FL can bring a new level of anonymity and personalization to this integration. The semantic representation of the locations can then be learned over time on users’ devices, maintaining users’ privacy while allowing for better-personalized models.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Within the realm of ML, Byzantine Resilience commonly denotes the ability to train an accurate statistical model amid the presence of arbitrary behaviors, commonly referred to as Byzantine users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. These behaviors manifest either due to faults or malicious users, encompassing scenarios like a compromised sensor in the TFP problem or a user aiming to promote specific items in a Top-N POI recommendation use case. In the best-case scenario, the trained model proves unusable, resulting in a cost loss incurred during its training. However, in the worst-case scenario, if the attack goes undetected (e.g., backdoors on GNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib160" title="" class="ltx_ref">160</a>]</cite>), the model might exhibit concealed yet malicious behaviors. This predicament poses a significant challenge owing to the difficulty of interpreting model parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Distinguishing between a Byzantine model update transmitted by a client or sensor and an honest but out-of-distribution client often presents a non-trivial task. This complexity amplifies in highly heterogeneous configurations typical of ST mobility FL applications. Its pertinence highlights this challenge as a substantial research track for Distributed ML and FL. Surprisingly, this aspect remains relatively unexplored in the context of ST mobility FL. Among the multitude of reviewed papers, only <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Meese et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib104" title="" class="ltx_ref">104</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>]</cite> have delved into such adversarial settings. However, neither of these works has considered the novel solutions proposed in this field, such as bucketing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite> and variance reduction techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.

</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, there is an urgent imperative to delve into this challenge and contemplate environments accommodating Byzantine behaviors within FL clients. This pursuit should be seen as a fundamental step to bridge the gap between research efforts and real world implementations. Specifically, it necessitates a comprehensive study and evaluation of existing Byzantine-resilient distributed learning algorithms, a deep understanding of their limitations, and subsequently adapting them to suit the inherent heterogeneity and dynamic evolution within the spatio-temporal context.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The race to enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) models is driving exponential growth in their number of parameters across various fields. In the realm of ST mobility models, where the necessity to capture diverse dimensions (spatial, temporal, preferential, and characteristic) is paramount, this growth becomes even more pronounced. A striking illustration of this trend is the substantial increase of over 4000% observed between ARIMA, a parametric model, and recent GNNs, which now number in the hundreds of thousands (see <a href="#S4.T7" title="In 4.2.2 GNN Based Approaches ‣ 4.2 Traffic Flow Prediction Approaches ‣ 4 Approaches ‣ Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, in classical ML, concerns centered around the costs associated with training these models and the extensive data required for such endeavors. However, the emergence of FL has shifted the focus towards apprehensions about the expenses related to communicating and transmitting these increasingly expansive models. Surprisingly, a notable observation is that the majority of existing works do not adequately consider these challenges within their frameworks. That is, they do not consider both the cost of training as well as the cost of collecting these models by the central server.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recognizing the significance of this issue, particularly in light of its comprehensive exploration in other fields, we advocate for heightened attention from the research community.

<div id="S5.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to trust and accountability, another challenge that we see spatial temporal mobility models will face under a federated setting is fairness. <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">That is to what extent the models that are trained on location traces are equitable?</span> Especially models that are designed for the purpose of mobility flow prediction and allocation of transport options. For instance, mobility demand prediction algorithms have been shown to offer higher service quality to neighbourhoods with more white people <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Indeed, as recent evidence from the broader machine learning domain has shown, the systematic discrimination in making decisions against different groups has been shifted from people to autonomous algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>. In many applications, discrimination may be defined by different protected attributes, such as race, gender, ethnicity, and religion, that directly prevent favourable outcomes for a minority group in societal resource allocation, education equality, employment opportunity, etc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>]</cite>. Measuring fairness of mobility models is a dimension that has been vastly overlooked in applications of spatial-temporal mobility models, with exception of a few works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib140" title="" class="ltx_ref">140</a>, <a href="#bib.bib141" title="" class="ltx_ref">141</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> and with little consensuses on how fairness should be defined and measured for spatial-temporal applications. One way of controlling for fairness of mobility models under the FL setting is to create auditing systems that can infer information about the training without having access to location data of the devices or the global model at the FL server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>, <a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">98</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S5.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As the landscape of spatio-temporal mobility research continuously evolves, it is increasingly crucial to establish a common ground for assessing its advancements. This involves not only pinpointing the most effective proposed solutions but also identifying the persistent challenges and shortcomings. Achieving this necessitates standardized datasets, uniform methods for data preprocessing and splitting, and ideally, a code base or metadata ensuring the reproducibility of each solution. Regrettably, similarly to other domains like recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, this practice is seldom followed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, in studies related to the TFP task, there is a prevalent use of diverse datasets, sometimes from the same source but across disparate timeframes, different space and time discretizing methods as well as unclear distinct splitting methods. These splits often rely on various sampling techniques. Yet, as underlined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">107</a>]</cite>, the process of partitioning data into training, testing, and potentially validation sets significantly influences the measured performance. Another example, specifically in Top-N POI recommendation, involves the utilization of metrics based on parameters (<span id="S5.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>, varying K values for accuracy at rank K). In FL, this challenge exacerbates due to the proliferation of parameters impacting the results (<span id="S5.SS5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\eg</span>, the number of clients, sampling strategies, aggregation techniques).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, robustly comparing different works, even those evaluated on identical datasets, becomes impossible. This is likely why most reviewed works unfortunately lack substantial comparisons with their federated counterparts. Moreover, considering that the distinct experimental procedures often stem from stochastic processes (client and data point sampling, stochastic learning), we stress the necessity for statistical tests to gauge the statistical significance of observed results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We acknowledge that research contexts rarely align perfectly. Nevertheless,
the need for standardizing datasets and preprocessing methodologies in the field is still undeniable. Existing surveys <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">163</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> have proposed solutions in a centralized context. While the direct applicability of these solutions to federated learning may require adaptation, they provide valuable insights and methodologies that can serve as foundational building blocks for the FL paradigm. Moreover, there have been several software efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib145" title="" class="ltx_ref">145</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>, <a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">111</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> that furnish a set of libraries for standardized spatio-temporal data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization.

Nevertheless, the long-term development of this field still requires realistic and large-scale federated datasets to be made available to support experimental evaluations under settings close to practical applications.
For instance, in the reviewed literature, there is a lack of research on how the geographic distribution of silos can lead to a geographically distinct flow of information.
Establishing policy-based scenarios in order to guide how the data should be partitioned across silos to reflect real-world data ownership challenges is a direction that we believe the research community will be working closely with other stakeholders in the future.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">5.7 </span>Transition to Real-world Deployment Through Dedicated Frameworks</h3>

<div id="S5.SS7.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we believe that just as crowd-sensing research was successful a decade ago through frameworks such as AWARE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, which reduced the burden of app development for data collection, frameworks specifically designed for federated mobility models will facilitate the transition from limited research to in-wild deployments. To achieve this transition, it is crucial to i) provide benchmarks for mobility applications and ii) develop mobility-centered federated learning frameworks, as was the case for graph applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> and IoT applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>]</cite>. This will allow the research community to effectively evaluate and compare the performance of federated learning models on mobility data.
We foresee that the transition between the current research efforts to real deployment will happen over stages where first multi-disciplinary research will focus on understanding users’ attitudes towards using their location data for training models. After all, similar research on crowd-sensing applications has shown that location information is a top concern of users’ involvement in these applications  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, currently, there are no existing works in understanding users’ privacy concerns when their data is not shared externally but is still used in creating predictive models. As a next step, we envision a slow transition between fully centralized models to decentralized models. Rather than training models focused on end-user prediction tasks, generative models that allow synthetic trace generation by learning from user mobility traces will be used to update and de-bias centralized datasets.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To create the summary of the surveys and their topics, we crawled the citation (bib file) of all the published articles with the keywords ‘Federated Learning’ and ‘Survey’ or ‘Review’ in the title for each year. We used the publish or perish tool for this crawling and used Google Scholar as the platform. We downloaded the abstracts of all these surveys from those papers and fed them to a Large Language Model (GPT 3.5) for thematic categorization of the topics. We followed a similar process for counting the number of papers per year that were published on ST FL topics (non-surveys).</p>
