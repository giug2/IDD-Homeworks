<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the field of machine learning (ML) to address resource management, interference management, autonomy, and decision-making in wireless networks. Traditional ML approaches rely on centralized methods, where data is collected at a central server for training. However, this approach poses a challenge in terms of preserving the data privacy of devices. To address this issue, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective solution that allows edge devices to collaboratively train ML models without compromising data privacy. In FL, local datasets are not shared, and the focus is on learning a global model for a specific task involving all devices. However, FL has limitations when it comes to adapting the model to devices with different data distributions. In such cases, meta learning is considered, as it enables the adaptation of learning models to different data distributions using only a few data samples. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive review of FL, meta learning, and federated meta learning (FedMeta). Unlike other tutorial papers, our objective is to explore how FL, meta learning, and FedMeta methodologies can be designed, optimized, and evolved, and their applications over wireless networks. We also analyze the relationships among these learning algorithms and examine their advantages and disadvantages in real-world applications.</p>

As shown in Fig. 1, in centralized learning, the devices communicate with a central server to upload their data by wired/wireless connections. In particular, the devices transmit their local data to a central server, and the central server performs all the computational tasks to train the data. Then, the output of the centralized learning model is delivered to devices. Centralized learning is computationally-efficient for devices as they are not required to be equipped with high computation capability. However, the traditional centralized training method may not be suitable for the ever-growing complexity and heterogeneity of wireless networks, such as device to device (D2D) and vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications, as shown in Fig. 1 (b) and (c), respectively, due to the following reasons:</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In order to overcome the aforementioned challenges, distributed learning has emerged as a solution to effectively and efficiently learn models from distributed data. Distributed learning refers to the use of multi-node machine learning algorithms and systems that are specifically designed to address the computational challenges associated with complex centralized algorithms operating on large-scale datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. By employing distributed learning algorithms, multiple learning models can be trained based on distributed datasets. This approach offers several advantages over centralized approaches, particularly when the number of datasets is large. One notable advantage is the potential for reducing biases, as the distributed learning enables the utilization of diverse datasets and mitigates the impact of individual dataset characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

In order to ensure the privacy of data and facilitate collaborative machine learning (ML) involving complex models distributed across IoT or mobile devices, a method called federated learning (FL) was initially introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> by McMahan et al. The standard steps of FL include: 1) each device trains a local model using its own dataset; 2) the devices send their local models to a central server for model aggregation; 3) the server updates the global model and transmits it back to the devices. These steps are repeated iteratively until convergence. In addition, FL offers several advantages over traditional centralized learning and distributed learning approaches that rely on the exchange of raw data. Some of these advantages include:</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the aforementioned advantages, FL has demonstrated its effectiveness in various applications, including training predictive models for human trajectory/behavior by mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, automatically learning users’ behavior patterns through smart home IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, and enabling collaborative diagnosis in health artificial intelligence (AI) among multiple hospitals and government agencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. However, these applications usually suffer from data heterogeneity (i.e., data with different statistical characteristics) and system heterogeneity (i.e., systems with different types of computation units), which severely affect the convergence and accuracy of FL algorithms. It is worth noting that FL primarily focuses on learning a single ML task across multiple devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and only develops a common output for all devices. Therefore, it does not adapt the model to each device. This is an important missing feature, especially given the heterogeneity of the underlying data distribution for various devices.
To address these limitations, integrating meta learning, also known as learning to learn, with FL becomes crucial, resulting in what is known as federated meta learning (FedMeta). FedMeta aims to solve multi-task learning problems. Meta learning aims to create AI models that are able to adapt to new tasks and improve their learning performance over time, without the need for extensive retraining. In other words, meta learning typically involves training a learning model on a variety of different tasks, with the goal of learning generalizable knowledge that can be transferred to new tasks. This is different from traditional ML, where a learning model is typically trained on a single task and then used for that task alone. In general, a meta learning algorithm is trained using the outputs, e.g., model predictions, and metadata of ML algorithms. After finishing training, its learning models are delivered for testing and used to make final predictions. In addition, meta learning includes tasks such as observing the learning performance of different ML models on learning tasks, learning from metadata, and faster learning process for new tasks.
While both federated learning (FL) and meta learning can be used in distributed learning systems and involve sharing a global model among multiple devices, they differ in three key aspects: (1) <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Data Distribution:</span> In FL, devices have their own datasets but perform the same task. On the other hand, meta learning involves multiple tasks, each with its corresponding dataset. (2) <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Update Mechanism:</span> FL utilizes local updates deployed by devices to enhance learning performance, whereas meta learning employs inner-loop updates for each task to improve learning performance. (3) <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Aggregation and Parameter Updates:</span> FL applies model aggregation to improve the global performance of all devices. In contrast, meta learning employs an outer-loop to update global parameters for all tasks. Initialization-based meta-learning algorithms, in particular, are known for fast adaptation and good generalization to new tasks. These distinctions highlight the different approaches and objectives of FL and meta learning. While FL focuses on collaborative learning with devices having different data distributions but performing the same task, meta learning guarantees the adaptation of models to multiple tasks with their corresponding datasets, often emphasizing fast adaptation and generalization capabilities, especially by initialization-based algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. The goal of FedMeta is to collaboratively meta-train a learning model using data from different tasks distributed among devices. The server maintains the initialized model and updates it by collecting testing loss from a mini batch of devices. The transmitted information in learning process consists of the model parameter initialization (from a server to devices) and testing loss (from devices to the server), and no data is required to be delivered to the server. Compared to FL, FedMeta has the following advantages:</p>

Table I highlights that surveys and tutorials for FL methodologies primarily focus on either fundamental definitions, architectures, challenges, future directions, and applications of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, or a specific subfield of FL, such as emerging trends of FL (FL in the intersection with other learning paradigms) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, communication efficiency of FL (challenges and constraints caused by limited bandwidth and computation ability) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, fairness-aware FL (client selection, optimization, contribution evaluation, incentive distribution, and performance metrics) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, federated reinforcement learning (FRL) (definitions, evolution, and advantages of horizontal FRL and vertical FRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, FL for natural language processing (NLP) (algorithm challenges, system challenges as well as privacy issues) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, incentive schemes for FL (stackelberg game, auction, contract theory, Shapley value, reinforcement learning, and blockchain) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, unlabeled data mining in FL (potential research directions, application scenarios, and challenges) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, and FL over next-generation Ethernet Passive Optical Networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, FL surveys and tutorials for wireless networks mainly focus on either fundamental theories, key techniques, challenges, future directions, and applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, or a specific subfield of FL applied in wireless networks, including FL in IoT (data sharing, offloading and caching, attack detection, localization, mobile crowdsensing, and privacy) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, communication-efficient FL under various challenges incurred by communication, computing, energy, and data privacy issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, FL for mobile edge computing (MEC) (communication cost, resource allocation, data privacy, data security, and implementation) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>, collaborative FL (definitions, advantages, drawbacks, usage conditions, and performance metrics) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>, and asynchronous FL (device heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, privacy and security, and applications) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper considering FL methodologies in different research areas, including model aggregation, gradient descent, communication efficiency, fairness, Bayesian learning, and clustering, and how FL algorithms evolve from the canonical one, namely, federated averaging (FedAvg), in detail. Also, we present a qualitative comparison considering advantages and disadvantages among different FL algorithms in the same research area.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There have been several surveys and tutorials focusing on meta learning methodologies over the past 20 years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>, <a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>, <a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>, <a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no existing surveys and tutorials in meta learning over wireless networks. To distinguish the scope of our tutorial from existing literature, we classify the available meta learning surveys and tutorials into different categories based on their focus, as presented in Table I. Furthermore, we compare and summarize the content of these existing surveys and tutorials in Table IV, aligning them with the structure and content of our own tutorial. Table I illutrates that the existing meta learning surveys and tutorials focused either on the general advancement, including definitions, models, challenges, research directions, and applications, of meta learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>, <a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite>, or exploring the detailed applications of meta learning in a specific meta learning field, including algorithm selection (transfer learning, few-shot learning, and beyond supervised learning) for data mining <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite>, NLP (especially few-shot applications, including definitions, research directions, and some common datasets) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>, and multi-modal meta learning in terms of the methodologies (few-shot learning and zero-shot learning) and applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no existing surveys or tutorials have covered the application of FedMeta in wireless networks, making our tutorial a unique contribution to this area of research.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In distributed learning, two main approaches are commonly used for learning across servers or devices: data parallelizing and model parallelizing. In the data parallelizing approach, the data is divided into multiple datasets, and each server or device applies the same machine learning (ML) algorithm to a different dataset. This approach allows for parallel processing of data, enabling faster training and improved scalability. On the other hand, the model parallelizing approach involves segmenting the ML model into different sub-models. Each sub-model is updated on different servers or devices, and therefore global model is therefore the aggregation of all sub-models. However, it is important to note that not all ML algorithms are compatible with the model parallel approach due to the specific requirements and dependencies of the model. It is also worth mentioning that data parallelizing and model parallelizing can be employed simultaneously, where both the data and the model are distributed across multiple servers or devices. This hybrid approach leverages the advantages of both techniques to achieve improved performance and efficiency in distributed learning scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite>. In this section, we will provide a comprehensive description of the background and fundamentals of distributed learning, including offline and online learning, learning topologies, challenges of distributed learning in wired/wireless networks, and application of FL in ML paradigms.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on whether the learning model is updated with newly arriving data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite>, distributed learning algorithms can be categorized into offline learning and online learning.
Offline learning refers to the process of updating the learning model using the knowledge derived from previous observations. The objective of offline learning is to maximize accuracy or long-term reward for prediction or decision-making tasks, leveraging the information gathered from historical data. On the other hand, online learning involves continuously updating the learning model in response to newly arriving data and observations from the environment. The primary goal of online learning is to optimize prediction or decision-making performance in real-time, adapting the model to changing circumstances. Both offline and online learning methods are designed to improve the learning accuracy and long-term reward of prediction or decision-making tasks. While offline learning focuses on leveraging historical observations, online learning emphasizes adaptability to real-time data streams and the ability to quickly update the model to capture changing patterns and dynamics in the environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Offline learning consists of two phases, namely, the training phase and the testing phase. In the training phase, the learning model is first trained with the training dataset until an optimal set of hyperparameters achieving the highest accuracy or reward for the given task. In the testing phase, the trained learning model is employed for prediction or decision-making without any further updates. The model utilizes its learned knowledge to make predictions or decisions on new data. The offline training method suffers from high re-training costs when dealing with new training data/environments, and thus, has poor scalability for real-world applications, especially when the amount of data grows and the environment evolves rapidly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Online learning can be applied to a wide range of ML algorithms, where the learning models are trained to handle prediction or decision-making tasks by continuously learning from a sequence of data samples in a sequence manner, one by one, in each time slot. Online learning addresses the limitations of offline learning by enabling the learning models to be updated constantly and efficiently as new training data becomes available. This constant updating of the learning models in online learning makes them highly efficient and scalable for large-scale ML tasks in real-world applications. By incorporating new training data in a timely manner, online learning models can adapt to evolving environments and changing data distributions, enhancing their ability to handle real-time and dynamic scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The selection of topology plays an important role in designing distributed ML systems. The topology determines how servers and devices are organized and connected within the system. Various factors, including the degree of distribution in transmitting learning models, influence the selection of a suitable topology. In this subsection, four general learning topologies in distributed ML are introduced and shown in Fig. 3, as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The centralized topology is characterized by a central server that is connected to multiple edge servers to obtain learning models, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The central server first obtains learning models from all edge servers, and the the model aggregation is executed at the central server. Next, the central server transmits the aggregated learning model to all edge servers. Each edge server then broadcasts the learning model to the devices it is connected to, and each device updates the transmitted learning model based on its local dataset.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The tree-like distributed topology is characterized by a hierarchical arrangement of connected nodes, resembling the branches of a tree, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). There is only one connection between any two connected nodes, establishing a natural parent and child hierarchy. Therefore, parameters are shared between parent and child nodes. The tree-like distributed topology offers advantages in scalability and manageability. Communication is simplified since each edge server or device only needs to interact with its parent and child servers, reducing the overall complexity of information exchange and coordination <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>. In this topology, the edge servers within the tree structure accumulate the local gradients computed by their child servers. These accumulated gradients are then passed up to their parent servers to calculate a global gradient. This process enables collaborative gradient computation across the tree-like structure, allowing the learning models to collectively update and optimize based on the information exchanged between parent and child nodes.</p>

All learning models are stored in the parameter servers using a global shared memory. Edge servers have direct access to the models stored at the parameter servers and can obtain and update the models as needed in any time slot. Meanwhile, edge devices communicate and share parameters with edge servers. The advantage of this topology lies in the direct accessibility of models for all edge servers. However, one drawback of this topology is the communication overhead. As the parameter servers handle all communication, there will be a large amount of communication overhead between the edge servers and the parameter servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>]</cite>.</p>

Instead, it consists of a set of independent edge servers, each responsible for updating its own learning model and directly exchanging its model with other edge servers. One of the key advantages of the fully distributed topology is its high scalability. Additionally, the fully distributed topology exhibits robustness against failures of individual servers, such as power outages or malfunctions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite>.

In GADMM, at most half of the edge servers are competing for the limited communication resources in each time slot.

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to address the challenges related to communication, computation, and data privacy, FL has emerged as an effective approach to exploit the distributed devices to collaboratively train ML models. FL was first introduced by Google in 2016, where multiple devices jointly train an ML model without sharing their private data, under the supervision of a central server. This ensures the privacy of the training data of all devices. FL has two entities: a centralized server that owns the global model and a set of devices that store the local models and training datasets. Meanwhile, FL consists of four procedures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>]</cite>: 1) training the local model based on the local dataset at the local device; 2) transmitting the local models from the devices to the central server; 3) aggregating the local models to a global model at the central server; and 4) updating the received global model from the central server at devices. The original data of each device is kept locally and does not need to be exchanged or migrated between devices, which ensures the privacy of each device. As a result, devices can benefit from the advantages of shared models trained by other devices without data sharing.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unsupervised learning is an ML approach that involves learning from unlabeled data samples. It utilizes ML algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets, which can discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. One prominent example of an unsupervised learning technique is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>]</cite>. PCA transforms high-dimensions data into lower-dimensions and it combines the original features into a new feature space by a projection direction that most information in the new feature space is retained from the original data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite>. A common application of unsupervised learning is clustering. In clustering, the learning model automatically groups the training data into groups with similar features. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite>, a federation of unsupervised learning (FedUL) was proposed to verify the possibility of unsupervised FL, where the unlabeled data were transformed into surrogate labeled data for each device, a modified model was trained by supervised FL, and the desired model was recovered from the modified model. FedUL is a very general solution to unsupervised FL. It is compatible with many supervised FL methods, and the recovery of the wanted model can be theoretically guaranteed as if the data have been labeled. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite>, federated PCA in a memory-limited setting was proposed, which provided robustness against stragglers. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite>, federated PCA for vertically partitioned dataset method was considered, which reduced the dimensionality across the joint datasets over all devices and extracted the principal component feature information for downstream data analysis.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Semi-supervised learning is a learning approach that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to perform learning tasks, and is conceptually sitting between supervised and unsupervised learning. By utilizing a large amount of unlabeled data in combination with smaller sets of labeled data, semi-supervised learning enables the learning model to accurately classify unlabeled data, leading to a significant improvement in learning accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">98</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>]</cite>, semi-supervised FL (SemiFed) was proposed to unify two dominant approaches for semi-supervised learning, which are consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. SemiFed first performs consistency
regularization, which encourages the network to produce similar output distributions when its inputs are perturbed. This regularization can be applied to all samples without labels. Following several rounds of training, the concept of pseudo-labeling is employed. Pseudo-labeling involves assigning artificial labels to unlabeled images and then training the model to predict these artificial labels when fed with unlabeled samples as input in the following training stages.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.SSS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning (RL) is an ML approach in which agents make decisions based on the observations obtained from the environment, aiming to maximize the long-term reward <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>]</cite>. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled input and output data. Instead, it focuses on striking a balance between exploration (of unknown territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge), and training ML models to make a sequence of decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite>. However, implementing RL in practical scenarios has several challenges. For example, it is impossible to explore the entire state-action spaces comprehensively. Although distributed RL algorithms can help solve the problem, they usually require data collection from each agent, which may compromise agent privacy and lead to information leakage. To address these privacy concerns, federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. FRL not only enables agents to learn optimal decisions in unknown environments but also ensures that the privately collected data during an agent’s exploration does not need to be shared with others.</p>

In this way, each device can iterate the local update in (6) multiple times before uploading local models, which can accelerate the convergence speed.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although FedAvg has achieved great success and is one of the most well-known algorithms in FL, the statistical heterogeneity challenges in the data are still difficult to overcome. That is to say, the training data follow a non-independent and non-identical distribution (non-IID), which negatively affects the convergence behavior. To address this issue, adaptive aggregation is introduced.</p>

This is mainly caused by two factors: 1) client drift, where the local models move away from the optimal global model, which can lead to unstable and slow convergence; and 2) lack of adaptivity, where the FedAvg may be unsuitable for datasets with heavy-tailed stochastic gradient noise distributions, this often happens in NLP research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>]</cite>. Heavy-tailed distributions are probability distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded, that is to say, they have heavier tails than the exponential distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite>. Several novel gradient descent methods have been proposed to solve the client drift and lack of adaptivity problems, which are introduced in the following:</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.Px1.p1.12" class="ltx_p">FedAdam was proposed to address the problem of the rapid decay of the learning rate of the FedAdagrad optimization algorithm. However, FedAdam leads to a situation where the past gradients are forgotten in a fairly fast manner, which can be especially problematic in sparse settings, where gradients are rarely non-zero <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite>. To solve the problem caused by FedAdam, a simple adaptive method called FedYogi was proposed.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.Px1.p2.4" class="ltx_p">These three adaptive optimizers have the same learning steps, including initialization, sampling subsets, and computing estimates, and they have been proved to achieve higher accuracy than FedAvg. However, these three adaptive optimizers have some differences. Unlike the FedAdagrad optimizer mainly well-suited for dealing with sparse data, both the FedAdam and FedYogi optimizers are suitable for sparse and non-sparse data. In addition, the FedAdam optimizer can rapidly increase the learning rate, while the FedYogi optimizer increases it in a controlled fashion, for which detailed proof is provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite>.</p>

For example, the storage, computation, and communication capabilities of each device in federated networks may be different due to variability in hardware (CPU, memory), network connectivity (3G, 4G, 5G, THz, WiFi), and power (battery level) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>, <a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>]</cite>. 2) Non-identically distributed data across networks, which is referred to as statistical heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite>. Fortunately, to address these issues, FedProx has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite> based on a federated optimization algorithm that can deal with heterogeneity both theoretically and empirically.

There are two advantages of the proximal term purpose: 1) it addresses the issue of statistical heterogeneity by restricting the local model updating to be closer to the global model without any need to set the number of local epochs manually, and 2) it allows for the aggregation of a large number of local models resulting from system heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p6.5" class="ltx_p">In sign-FL, the size of the quantized gradient for model aggregation is just 1 bit, which significantly increases communication efficiency. However, it may lead to low learning accuracy and convergence rate. This is because fewer model weights are delivered to the central server for model aggregation, compared with the compression methods proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>]</cite>.</p>

FD leverages ensemble distillation techniques and exchanges model outputs between the central server and participating devices. Therefore, in FD, each device only exchanges the output of the local model, and the communication payload size is not determined by the model size but by the output dimension, resulting in advantageous communication properties and achieving orders of magnitude reduction of the communication overhead compared with FedAvg, especially when large models are trained <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite>. In FD, each device only exchanges the output of the model, the dimension of which is much smaller than that of the local model. In FD, each device treats itself as a student, and treats the averaged model output from all other devices as its teacher’s output. The model output of each device is a set of logit values normalized through a softmax function, and is denoted as a logit vector whose size is determined by the number of labels of all data samples. The teacher-student output difference is measured periodically by cross entropy and becomes the loss regularizer of the student, namely, the distillation regularizer.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To guarantee communication efficiency, each device stores mean logit vectors, and periodically uploads these local-average logit vectors to a server. For each label, the uploaded local-average logit vectors from all devices are averaged, resulting in a global-average logit vector per label, which will be further downloaded to each device. When each device computes the distillation regularizer, its teacher’s output is selected as the global-average logit vector associated with the same label as the current training sample’s label.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the current FL works assume all devices contribute equally to the global model in each communication round, rather than prioritizing them based on their contributions. However, in practice, not all devices contribute equally due to various reasons, such as the different quality and quantity of the data owned by each device. Therefore, the local model from some devices may result in better global model updates, whereas those of others may impair the performance of the global model. To address this issue, fairness needs to be considered in the FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib132" title="" class="ltx_ref">132</a>]</cite>.</p>

To address this issue, agnostic FL (AFL) was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite>, where the global model was optimized for any target distribution formed by a mixture of device distributions, with the aim to minimize the loss function of all devices and guarantee fairness among devices.

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedAvg requires access to locally stored data for learning. However, it is possible that the local model cannot be trained by the local data. Such situations may be caused by catastrophic data loss or by regulations such as the general data protection regulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>]</cite>, which places severe restrictions on the storage and access of personal data. Thus, the transmitted local model cannot be updated by the local data in the current time slot. To solve this problem, Bayesian machinery can be deployed to estimate the local model weights via probabilistic neural matching based on the pre-trained local models. Then, the local models estimated by the Bayesian machinery and the updated local models trained by local data are delivered to the server for model aggregation.</p>

Through the permutation invariance of a fully-connected neural network, the proposed PFNM algorithm first matches the weights of the transmitted local model from each device to the weights of the global model. Then, it aggregates these local models by maximizing the posterior estimation of the global weights. As a result, the PFNM algorithm can achieve higher accuracy and communication efficiency than FedAvg. However, the PFNM algorithm can only be effective for simple architectures of the neural network, such as fully-connected feedforward neural networks.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p4.3" class="ltx_p">In the FedMA algorithm, first, the server gathers only the weights of the first layers from devices and performs one-layer matching to obtain the weights of the first layer of the global model. Then, the server broadcasts these weights to the devices, and each device updates the first layer of its local model to train all consecutive layers with its own dataset, keeping the matched layer frozen. The procedure continues until all layers have finished matching. Thus, FedMA requires the number of communication rounds to be equal to the number of layers in the neural network.

This procedure continues until all clusters with similarity are merged into a single cluster. Then, these merged clusters select a portion of their devices to aggregate the local models in the server via (7), and the local models in the devices are still updated using (6). By selecting a portion of the devices in the merged clusters to aggregate the local models, the communication overhead is reduced.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib143" title="" class="ltx_ref">143</a>]</cite>, a multi-center aggregation mechanism for multiple global models in clustered FL was proposed, where devices belong to a specific cluster, and the cluster updates its own global model with its corresponding updated local models, as shown in Fig. 8. Each device calculates the distance between its local model and the
global model of the server in each cluster. The device selects the cluster with the minimum
distance. The learning objective of multi-center clustered FL is to minimize the total weighted distance between the global model and the local models, and the multi-center weight distance-based loss (MD-Loss) is represented as</p>

Although FL by itself has a certain level of resilience against attacks, the frequent communications between server and devices may spread the risk over the
networks and thus breaks down the overall learning systems. Therefore, how to design a FL algorithm that is robust to poisoned data and design resilient networks for FL to avoid spreading attacks needs to be investigated.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, there is a growing interest in optimizing wireless networks with data-driven ML-based methods. In this section, based on the fundamental FL algorithms in Section III, we present the research areas of designing FL for wireless networks. Considering FL in wireless networks, all weights of local or global models are delivered via wireless links instead of wired ones. Thus, the model aggregation, learning accuracy, and learning efficiency of FL can be influenced by wireless factors, such as the set of devices that participate in FL, computational capacity, transmission power and wireless channel, and spectrum resource allocation. The impact of these factors on FL performance is introduced as follows:</p>

This is because a high SNR threshold reduces the chance of successful transmission from an arbitrary device, while PF improves the convergence rate by selecting devices with better channel qualities in order to increase their transmission success probabilities. However, RR is preferable when the SNR threshold is low, this is because low SNR threshold results in a high success probability.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL over wireless networks, there are two trade-offs, between computation and communication latencies, and between learning latency and device energy consumption. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> decomposed the problem into two sub-problems, which were the learning latency versus device energy consumption problem solved by the Pareto efficiency model, and the computation versus communication latencies problem, solved via finding the optimal learning accuracy with KKT conditions. The Pareto efficiency model minimizes the learning latency and does not increase the energy costs of each device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib162" title="" class="ltx_ref">162</a>]</cite>. Through iteratively obtaining the closed-form solutions of these two sub-problems, the authors characterized how the computation and communication latencies of mobile devices affect trade-offs between energy consumption, learning time, and learning accuracy. However, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> relied on an impractical assumption that the channel state information (CSI) remained unchanged during the whole FL process. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">163</a>]</cite>, the authors considered imperfect CSI. Under imperfect CSI, channels between the server and devices over each resource block (RB) are predicted using their past observations. Then, based on Lyapunov optimization, joint device scheduling and RB allocation policy were proposed to minimize the loss function in FL over wireless networks. The local and global model updatings in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>, <a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">163</a>]</cite> still follow (6) and (7), respectively.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">For the research on resource allocation of FL over wireless networks, it jointly designs the spectrum resource allocation and device selection. Due to the limited number of RBs in the uplink transmission, only a fraction of devices can transmit local models to the base station (BS). To solve this problem, a probabilistic device selection scheme was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib164" title="" class="ltx_ref">164</a>]</cite> to select the devices whose local models have significant effects on the global model.

In (87), it means that all RBs should be allocated to the devices associated with the BS. To increase the convergence speed of FL, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to predict the local models of devices that cannot transmit their local model weights. To enable the BS to predict the local model, each device should have a chance of connecting to the BS to provide local model weights for training DNNs. Thus, a probabilistic device association scheme was proposed as</p>

However, when a large number of devices uploading high-dimensional local models, the classic orthogonal-access schemes, such as OFDMA and TDMA, are not able to scale well with an increasing number of devices. To deal with this issue, over-the-air computation (OAC) has been proposed, it is a disruptive technology for fast data aggregation in wireless networks through exploiting the waveform superposition property of multi-access channels. In particular, the transmitted signal in the uplink transmission is superimposed over-the-air and their weighted sums, so-called the aggregated signal, are processed at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib171" title="" class="ltx_ref">171</a>, <a href="#bib.bib172" title="" class="ltx_ref">172</a>]</cite>.</p>

In BAA, the weights of local models are first modulated into symbols. Then, the symbol sequence is divided into blocks, and each block is transmitted in a single OFDM symbol over one frequency sub-channel. Sub-channels are inverted by power control, so that weights transmitted by different devices are received with identical amplitudes, achieving amplitude alignment at the receiver as required for BAA.</p>

In the downlink transmission, broadcasting updated model weights guarantees that the devices compute the gradients based on the same model weights. On the other hand, broadcasting aggregated gradients in multi-cell OAC promotes the personalization of model weights for devices located at the cell edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib181" title="" class="ltx_ref">181</a>]</cite>.</p>

In distributed sensing, OAC is able to achieve efficient distributed sensing by conducting simultaneous transmission among all sensors, and the desired
function can be directly computed over the air. In autonomous control, a group of agents desire to perform some actions
to accomplish an overall cooperative task by interacting with
each other. As a result, each agent needs to iteratively collect information from others for updating its own state until convergence, which generally consists of two phases within
each iteration, i.e., the communication phase for information exchanges and the computation phase for state updates. By
integrating these two phases, efficient network-wide consensus
can be achieved by OAC in a distributed manner. However, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib177" title="" class="ltx_ref">177</a>, <a href="#bib.bib178" title="" class="ltx_ref">178</a>, <a href="#bib.bib179" title="" class="ltx_ref">179</a>, <a href="#bib.bib180" title="" class="ltx_ref">180</a>, <a href="#bib.bib181" title="" class="ltx_ref">181</a>]</cite> generally assumed some ideal communication conditions and ignore practical implementation issues.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Since OAC focuses on uplink
transmission, time-division duplexing (TDD) is commonly considered in the existing research works to achieve local CSI estimation at each device based
on the pilot signal broadcast by the edge server. In TDD systems, the uplink and downlink transmissions are carried out in the same frequency channel but in different time slots. Therefore, the edge server first broadcasts pilot signals to devices for estimating the local CSI, and then obtains the global CSI based on the feedback from devices by assuming the channel reciprocity. However, the communication overhead is linearly scaling with the number of devices for CSI feedback, which may lead high transmission latency in ultra-dense networks. To address this issue, effective channel feedback approaches should be developed to realize OAC while avoiding massive overhead for CSI gathering. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib183" title="" class="ltx_ref">183</a>]</cite>, random orthogonalization was proposed for FL in massive MIMO systems, which significantly reduced the channel estimation overhead while achieving OAC model aggregation without requiring transmitter side CSI.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, in practical systems, the transceivers can only obtain imperfect CSI because of multiple reasons, such as inaccurate channel estimation and finite-rate feed back. Therefore, simply implementing the system design based on the assumption of perfect CSI may lead to poor learning performance in practical wireless networks with imperfect CSI. To address this issue, robust design of OAC is required to achieve a reliable functional computation under imperfect CSI. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib184" title="" class="ltx_ref">184</a>]</cite>, a maximum-likelihood estimation design for misaligned AirComp with residual channel-gain variation and
symbol-timing asynchrony among devices was proposed. To further address the error propagation and noise enhancement problems at the maximum likelihood estimator, a whitened matched filtering and sampling (WMFS) scheme was deployed.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, most of the current design for OAC relies on the instantaneous CSI at the edge server or devices. However, the cumbersome CSI acquisition introduces extra transmission latency and communication overhead, which motivates the CSI-free design, so-called blind design for OAC. To mitigate the possible destructive signal superposition due to the phase difference when CSI is not available, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib185" title="" class="ltx_ref">185</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib186" title="" class="ltx_ref">186</a>]</cite> considered the one-bit quantization to realize blind OAC, where the receiver obtains the sign of aggregated signals based on majority vote by detecting the energy accumulated on different OFDM subcarriers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib185" title="" class="ltx_ref">185</a>]</cite> and superposed pulse-position modulation symbols <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib186" title="" class="ltx_ref">186</a>]</cite>, which avoided the reliance on the CSI and relaxed the requirement of synchronization. In addition, the balanced number system was considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib187" title="" class="ltx_ref">187</a>]</cite> to enable continuous-valued computations in the digital OAC system without the need of CSI acquisition.</p>

The evolution of FedAvg in wireless networks is shown in Fig. 11. According to Fig. 11, through jointly or separately optimizing equations (3), (4), (6), and (7), FL can be more appropriate for wireless networks. In addition, theoretical convergence analysis is usually derived based on five fundamental assumptions.</p>

<p id="S4.I2.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synchronous FL systems are susceptible to the straggler effect. As a result, asynchronous FL has been proposed to solve the problem. Asynchronous FL allows devices to participate in model training even a training round is in progress. This is more reflective of practical FL scenarios and is an important contribution towards guaranteeing the scalability of FL. However, synchronous FL is still the most common approach used because of its convergence guarantees. Therefore, the convergence analysis in asynchronous FL settings needs to be investigated.</p>

However, in wireless networks, because of network congestion, interference, and bit error, the model transmission between servers and devices may fail or contain errors, which further affects learning performance. Therefore, robust FL algorithms over wireless networks should be investigated to address the issue.</p>

Meta-learning algorithms can be categorized into three main directions: (1) metric-based, (2) model-based, and (3) gradient-based optimization methods, which are introduced in detail in the following subsections. The introduced meta learning methodologies are fundamental meta learning algorithms from the CS community without considering any wireless factors.</p>

Then, new tasks are learned by comparing new inputs with example inputs in the meta-learned feature space. The higher the similarity between the new input and the example input, the more likely that the new input has the same label as the example input. Thus, metric-based meta-learning aims to learn a similarity kernel that takes two inputs, and outputs their similarity score. Larger similarity scores present larger similarities. In this subsection, we introduce four key metric-based meta-learning methods, including siamese networks, matching networks, prototypical networks, and relation networks. The relationship among these four methods is presented in Fig. 12.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to the metric-based approaches deploying fixed neural networks at the testing phase, model-based meta-learning algorithms depend on the internal state of each task. Specifically, model-based approaches process the support set in a sequential fashion. In each time slot, the internal state captures relevant task-specific information with the given inputs, which can be used to make predictions for new inputs. Meanwhile, task information from previous inputs should be remembered, so that model-based methods have a memory component. In this subsection, we introduce four key model-based meta-learning methods, including memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs), meta networks (MetaNets), recurrent meta-learners (RMLs), and simple neural attentive meta-learner (SNAIL). The relationship of these four networks are shown in Fig. 13.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">MANNs were proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib193" title="" class="ltx_ref">193</a>]</cite> to allow for quick task-specific adaptation with the help of a neural turing machine (NTM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib194" title="" class="ltx_ref">194</a>]</cite> and an external memory. The learning procedure of MANNs is that the data of a task is processed as a sequence. First, the support set is input to MANN. Then, the query set is evaluated. The interaction between NTM and external memory is that NTM gradually accumulates meta knowledge across tasks, and the external memory helps to store the obtained knowledge. Given new inputs, NTM leverages the previously obtained meta knowledge stored in the external memory to make predictions. MANNs integrate the external memory and a neural network to achieve meta learning. Different from metric-based meta-learning, MANN can be used for both classification and regression problems. However, it has higher architectural complexity.</p>

However, different from MANN, MetaNets are divided into two distinct subsystems, which are base-learner and meta-learner, as shown in Fig. 14. The base-learner is used to perform tasks, and provide meta knowledge for the meta-learner. Then, the meta-learner calculates fast task-specific weights for itself and the base-learner. The training of MetaNet consists of three main procedures: (1) Acquisition of meta knowledge; (2) Generation of fast weights; (3) Optimization of slow weights. MetaNets depend on base-learner and meta-learner for each task. Although it can be used for both supervised and reinforcement learning scenarios, the learning architecture is quite complex and leads to a high burden on memory usage and computation time.</p>

Similar to MANN, RML still uses memory to store the meta knowledge and the task data is sequentially input into the learning model. However, RMLs have simple learning architectures, mainly perform well on simple reinforcement learning tasks, and cannot be adapt to complex learning scenarios.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to MANN, SNAIL proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib198" title="" class="ltx_ref">198</a>]</cite> still processes task data in sequence. However, rather than using external memory, SNAIL deploys a special model architecture to serve as memory. The special model consists of 1D temporal convolutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib199" title="" class="ltx_ref">199</a>]</cite> and a soft attention mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib200" title="" class="ltx_ref">200</a>]</cite>. The 1D convolutions are used for memory access, and the attention mechanism allows SNAIL to pinpoint specific experiences. Furthermore, SNAIL contains three building blocks, which are DenseBlock, TCBlock, and AttentionBlock. The DenseBlock deploys a single 1D convolution to the input and connects to the result, the TCBlock consists of a series of DenseBlocks, and the AttentionBlock learns the important parts of prior experience. A key advantage of SNAIL is that it can be used for both supervised and reinforcement learning scenarios, and it achieves better learning accuracy performance than that of the other three model-based meta-learning algorithms.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the metric-based and model-based meta learning approaches, gradient-based meta-learning is mainly trained with an interleaved training procedure, including inner loop of task-specific adaptation and outer loop of meta initialization training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib201" title="" class="ltx_ref">201</a>, <a href="#bib.bib202" title="" class="ltx_ref">202</a>]</cite>. The traditional gradient-based meta learning is model-agnostic meta learning (MAML). Based on MAML, several other advanced meta learning models have been proposed, which are meta-SGD, reptile, Bayesian MAML (BMAML), Laplace approximation for meta adaptation (LLAMA), latent embedding optimization (LEO), MAML with Implicit Gradients (iMAML), and online MAML, as shown in Fig. 15.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Meta-SGD was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib213" title="" class="ltx_ref">213</a>]</cite>, which is an easily trainable meta-learner that could initialize and adapt any learner in just one step, for both supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Different from MAML, Meta-SGD can achieve a much higher accuracy not only by the learner initialization, but also by the learner update direction and learning rate, all in a single meta learning process.

The loss from the generated weights is propagated backward to update the model weights. In practice, generating a such high-dimensional set of parameters from a low-dimensional space is quite problematic. Thus, LEO uses pre-trained models, and only generates weights for the final layer, which limits the dimension of the model.</p>

In online meta learning, memory usage keeps increasing over time. This is because in each time slot, the incoming tasks and their corresponding datasets are stored in memory, which is used to obtain the model weights. The summary of gradient-based meta learning is summarized in Table VI.</p>

<p id="S5.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Metric-based meta learning learn a feature space that is deployed to classification tasks based on input similarity scores. The advantages of metric-based meta learning are that (1) the approach of similarity-based classification is simple and (2) the computation latency at the testing phase is low when tasks are small, it is because the learning model does not need to make task-specific adjustments. However, when the tasks at the testing phase are distant from the tasks used in the training phase, the learning accuracy decreases. In addition, metric-based meta learning is usually used in supervised learning scenarios.</p>

Advantages of model-based meta learning are the flexibility of the internal dynamics of systems, and their broader applicability compared to metric-based meta learning. Unfortunately, the learning performance of model-based meta learning is worse than that of metric-based meta learning. Also, model-based meta learning is usually used in supervised learning scenarios.</p>

The key advantage of gradient-based meta learning is that it can achieve much better learning performance on more task distributions than metric-based and model-based meta learning. However, gradient-based meta learning optimizes a meta-learner for each task which results in high computation and memory costs.

<div id="S6.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the traditional methods for network traffic prediction is a feed-forward predictor, which consists of a traffic classifier trained to recognize specific types of traffic, such as videos, web traffic, file downloading, and a predictor that takes the network traffic and classification results as inputs, as shown in Fig. 19. However, it requires a large amount of labeled datasets to train each traffic classifier, which leads to high computation complexity. To address this issue, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib230" title="" class="ltx_ref">230</a>]</cite> proposed a feedback traffic prediction architecture based on a meta-learning scheme. The feed-back architecture is presented in Fig. 20, where the predictor is selected based on observed prediction accuracy by DRL, rather than the traffic class. The reason for using meta learning is that, it is recently employed in robust adversarial learning, which can exploit models by taking advantage of obtainable model information and using it to create malicious attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib234" title="" class="ltx_ref">234</a>, <a href="#bib.bib235" title="" class="ltx_ref">235</a>, <a href="#bib.bib236" title="" class="ltx_ref">236</a>]</cite>. According to Fig. 21, the meta-learning scheme used in the predictor consists of a master policy and a set of sub-policies. The master policy is responsible for selecting which sub-policy is used for prediction during the next prediction interval. The meta-learning scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib230" title="" class="ltx_ref">230</a>]</cite> allows for the updating of sub-predictors in real-time, so that the sub-predictors have the ability to adapt to variations in traffic patterns over time. The prediction accuracy of meta learning scheme significantly outperforms that of any single predictor. However, when a new sub-predictor is added to sub-predictors, the master policy needs to be retrained, which leads to high computational costs.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep neural networks (DNNs) have the potential for efficiently balancing the bit-error rate minimization and computation complexity of MIMO detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib241" title="" class="ltx_ref">241</a>, <a href="#bib.bib242" title="" class="ltx_ref">242</a>, <a href="#bib.bib243" title="" class="ltx_ref">243</a>, <a href="#bib.bib244" title="" class="ltx_ref">244</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, the existing DNN-based MIMO detectors are difficult to be deployed in practical systems due to their slow convergence speed and low robustness in new environments. To deal with this issue, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib233" title="" class="ltx_ref">233</a>]</cite> proposed meta-learning-based MIMO detectors, which could be used in channel-sensitive environments. In particular, an expectation propagation (EP) for signal detection is unfolded as EPNet, and damping factors are set as trainable parameters to adapt to new channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib245" title="" class="ltx_ref">245</a>, <a href="#bib.bib246" title="" class="ltx_ref">246</a>, <a href="#bib.bib247" title="" class="ltx_ref">247</a>, <a href="#bib.bib248" title="" class="ltx_ref">248</a>]</cite>. Damping factors are relevant to channel statistics. To train the damping factors, a large amount of labeled channel state information (CSI) is required. However, in a dynamic real-time wireless system, it is impractical to obtain enough CSI to train the damping factors. Thus, meta learning is deployed to update the damping factors efficiently by using a small training set so that they can quickly adapt to new environments.</p>

It is observed that FedMeta provides a faster convergence speed and higher learning accuracy.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib257" title="" class="ltx_ref">257</a>]</cite> proposed a platform-based collaborative learning framework, where a model was first trained in a set of edge nodes by FedMeta, and then it was rapidly adapted to learn a new task at the target edge node with a few data samples. This can deal with the constrained computing resources and limited local data issues of each edge node. The FedMeta algorithm used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib257" title="" class="ltx_ref">257</a>]</cite> is the same as that used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib256" title="" class="ltx_ref">256</a>]</cite>. However, according to Fig. 23, the main differences are that: 1) Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib257" title="" class="ltx_ref">257</a>]</cite> deployed a set of source edge nodes only with a support dataset to train the local models, rather than authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib256" title="" class="ltx_ref">256</a>]</cite> assuming that each device had both support and query datasets to train and test the local model; 2) Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib257" title="" class="ltx_ref">257</a>]</cite> assumed that each source edge node focused on only one task to train the local model, rather than authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib256" title="" class="ltx_ref">256</a>]</cite> assuming that each device had multiple tasks; 3) Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib257" title="" class="ltx_ref">257</a>]</cite> used a platform to aggregate local models from all source edge nodes and transmitted the aggregated model to the target edge node for new task adaptation, rather than authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib256" title="" class="ltx_ref">256</a>]</cite> assuming that each device was able to adapt to new tasks. With model training at multiple edge nodes, FedMeta can adapt to multiple tasks in parallel. However, for cases with a large number of tasks, delivering multiple learning models simultaneously can result in high transmission latency.</p>

The advantage of using ADMM-FedMeta is that the decoupled sub-problems can be allocated to multiple edge nodes to solve simultaneously, which helps to alleviate the local computational costs and improve the computation efficiency. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib258" title="" class="ltx_ref">258</a>]</cite>, the comparison of the convergence speed of ADMM-FedMeta and FedAvg is shown in Fig. 24. It is observed that ADMM-FedMeta achieves a much higher convergence speed than that of FedAvg.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedMeta integrates the advantages of FL and meta learning, which enables local model sharing without privacy issues and fast adaptation to new tasks. Through learning an initial shared model, devices can quickly adapt the learned model to their local datasets via one or a few gradient descent steps. Despite its advantages, FedMeta still has several challenges: First, the number of participating devices can be enormous. When devices are randomly selected, it can lead to a low convergence speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib258" title="" class="ltx_ref">258</a>]</cite>. Second, the convergence performance of FedMeta in a wireless network is highly related to its latency, which includes computation latency, determined by the size of local datasets and CPU types of devices, and transmission latency, determined by channel gains, interference, and transmission power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib270" title="" class="ltx_ref">270</a>]</cite>. If these factors are not optimized, high latency can result in unexpected training delay and communication inefficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib271" title="" class="ltx_ref">271</a>]</cite>. In this subsection, we introduce device selection and energy efficiency of FedMeta over wireless networks, based on the fundamental FedMeta methodologies.</p>

To apply FedMeta over wireless networks, the authors propose a resource allocation problem, capturing the trade-offs among the convergence, computation and communication latency, and energy consumption. Then, the optimization problem is decomposed into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem aims at controlling the CPU-cycle frequencies for devices to minimize energy consumption and computation latency. The second sub-problem controls transmission power and resource block allocation to maximize the convergence speed while minimizing the transmission cost and latency. Both of the sub-problems are solved by KKT conditions.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.SSS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In FedMeta, each task is owned by a device, and each updating iteration needs to communicate with the server. In each iteration, each device updates its local model and transmits it to the server, where the meta model is updated in a global step and then the updated meta model is feedback to all devices. Since these procedures involve local computation and communication energy consumption, it is important to minimize the computation costs and save energy for communication, especially for a device with limited computation capability and energy. To minimize energy and computation costs when performing FedMeta, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib274" title="" class="ltx_ref">274</a>]</cite> considered an energy-efficient FedMeta framework, where a meta-backward algorithm was proposed, to learn a meta model with low computation and communication energy consumption.

<p id="S7.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedMeta is the integration of FL with meta learning, which not only guarantees user privacy but also quickly adapts to multiple tasks. However, for scenarios with plenty of tasks, optimizing a meta-learner for each task and frequently delivering local and global models between servers and devices lead to high computation and communication latency. Although we mainly focus on FedMeta with MAML and Meta-SGD in this section, other meta learning algorithms, such as Reptile, BMAML, LLAMA, LEO, iMAML, Online MAML, can still be used in FedMeta.</p>

The key challenge is how to effectively train models across multiple devices. Architecture challenge includes whether it is possible to use a peer-to-peer architecture. Another challenge would arise if the system should not only focus on the globally best algorithm for a task (an entire dataset) but if per-instance algorithm selection should be learned. This would make the whole system even more complex.</p>

Device selection and energy-efficient FedMeta cannot achieve significant effectiveness. Therefore, the trade-off between the local model
updating and global model aggregation in FedMeta to minimize the convergence time and energy cost from a long-term perspective needs to be investigated. Also, how to characterize the convergence properties and communication complexity of FedMeta over wireless networks requires further research.</p>

Nevertheless, in practical wireless systems, some devices may become inactive due to poor connectivity and energy constraints, namely, device dropout. Thus, they may leave the FL process and cannot participate in model aggregation, which can severely degrade the performance of FL, such as low learning accuracy and low convergence speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib304" title="" class="ltx_ref">304</a>]</cite>. To deal with this issue, new FL algorithms need to be designed to be robust for the network, where only a small number of dynamic users exist for model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib305" title="" class="ltx_ref">305</a>]</cite>.

The dynamic wireless environment can severely affect the transmission performance, which can lead to a low transmission rate and high transmission errors, and further lead to high transmission latency and low learning accuracy, especially for hierarchical FL (HFL). HFL is an architecture that deploys FL in heterogeneous wireless networks with three levels, including devices, SBS, and MBS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib306" title="" class="ltx_ref">306</a>]</cite>. In each time slot, a set of devices are selected to train the allocated global model using FedSGD algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib307" title="" class="ltx_ref">307</a>]</cite>, and then the local models are transmitted to their corresponding SBSs to be aggregated. The MBS and SBSs communicate with each other periodically to maintain a central model. HFL combines the advantages of edge FL and cloud FL. The cloud server can access more learning models, and the edge server enjoys more efficient communications with devices, leveraging edge servers as intermediaries to perform partial model aggregation in proximity, and relieve core network transmission overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib308" title="" class="ltx_ref">308</a>, <a href="#bib.bib309" title="" class="ltx_ref">309</a>]</cite>. However, the disadvantages of HFL are that the cloud may have excessive communication overhead and high latency, especially when a large number of devices and edge servers exist in wireless networks. One possible solution is to consider the joint design of device clustering, asynchronous FL, and communication efficiency, and use DRL algorithms to select optimal edge servers and devices for model aggregation in different time slots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib310" title="" class="ltx_ref">310</a>]</cite>.</p>

If the mobile device is far away from the active edge server, the learning model downloading/uploading can be done in Device-to-Device (D2D) connections. However, when a large number of mobile devices exist, selecting only one edge server for model aggregation can lead to high overhead and workload. Thus, multiple edge servers should be active for model aggregation. In this case, mobile devices need to select the optimal edge servers for model aggregation, and active edge servers should further select one edge server for global model aggregation.</p>

Model weights are transmitted by D2D communication. There are no research works considering how wireless factors, such as transmission power, wireless channel, and spectrum resource allocation, affect the convergence rate and learning accuracy of fully decentralized FL. Meanwhile, because of limited communication resources in D2D transmission, how to select proper devices for model sharing still needs to be investigated.</p>

Meta learning also requires a large number of task datasets. Usually, authors assume that tasks are independently and identically distributed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib312" title="" class="ltx_ref">312</a>]</cite>, and do not consider non-stationary distribution. If the task datasets change dynamically and do not have the same distribution, meta learning cannot adapt to the variation efficiently. Thus, it is difficult for meta learning to address complex datasets. One potential way to solve this issue is to propose a meta learning algorithm that is robust to tasks with a non-stationary distribution.</p>
