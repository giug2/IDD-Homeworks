<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">We describe federated reconnaissance, a class of learning problems in which distributed clients learn new concepts independently and communicate that knowledge efficiently. In particular, we propose an evaluation framework and methodological baseline for a system in which each client is expected to learn a growing set of classes and communicate knowledge of those classes efficiently with other clients, such that, after knowledge merging, the clients should be able to accurately discriminate between classes in the superset of classes observed by the set of clients. We compare a range of learning algorithms for this problem and find that prototypical networks are a strong approach in that they are robust to catastrophic forgetting while incorporating new information efficiently. Furthermore, we show that the online averaging of prototype vectors is effective for client model merging and requires only a small amount of communication overhead, memory, and update time per class with no gradient-based learning or hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, to put our results in context, we find that a simple, prototypical network with four convolutional layers significantly outperforms complex, state of the art continual learning algorithms, increasing the accuracy by over 22% after learning 600 Omniglot classes and over 33% after learning 20 mini-ImageNet classes incrementally. These results have important implications for federated reconnaissance and continual learning more generally by demonstrating that communicating feature vectors is an efficient, robust, and effective means for distributed, continual learning.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated reconnaissance</span>, a new a class of learning problems in which distributed models should be able to learn new concepts independently and share that knowledge efficiently. Typically in federated learning, a single static set of classes is learned by each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. In contrast, federated reconnaissance requires that each client can individually learn a growing set of classes and communicate knowledge of previously observed and new classes efficiently with other clients. This communication about learned classes permits <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">merging</span> the knowledge from the clients; the resulting merged model is then expected to support the superset of the classes each client has been exposed to. The merged model can then be deployed back out to the clients for further learning. In practice, a client in a distributed system may only see a small number of examples for a new class. This problem therefore stands at the intersection of large bodies of work on continual, meta-, and federated learning.
Examples of this problem include mobile phone applications in which the service should be able to both learn to identify instances of a new class added by a user and transfer that classification ability to other client devices.
In this paper, we outline related work, formalize the federated reconnaissance problem statement, introduce a benchmark by adapting mini-ImageNet  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vinyals et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, compare a range of learning algorithms and neural network architectures, and find that a simple algorithm adapting prototypical networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Snell et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is a strong baseline for both single client continual learning and federated reconnaissance.

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Continual learning of new concepts is an open and long-standing problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence with no semblance of a unified solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Thrun and Mitchell, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>; Lopez-Paz and Ranzato, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Shin et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Zenke et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; van de Ven and Tolias, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Farajtabar et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. While deep neural networks have proven to be incredibly effective in a wide range of tasks, the available methods for continuously integrating new information whilst remembering previously learned concepts suffer from being either compute inefficient (in the case of algorithms that retrain on a cache of examples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rebuffi et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> or on generated examples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(van de Ven et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>) or lacking in expressivity and accuracy (in the case of regularization-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kirkpatrick et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>). Much earlier work on continual learning (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">van de Ven and Tolias (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and their citations) focused on learning classes or tasks sequentially from scratch. While this is an interesting problem setting for studying neural memory, it can be impractical and unnecessary for deployment to production systems. In more recent work on continual learning, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Javed and White (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Prabhu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Beaulieu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> change the continual learning problem setup
by assuming access to a set of pretraining data, often referred to as a set of meta-training tasks, and find that such pretraining can benefit later continual learning.
Access to a pretraining dataset is a reasonable assumption for production systems and enables the development of algorithms that can first learn invariances that can later be exploited when learning new classes online.
In this work, we assume access to a set of pretraining data and explore algorithms that allow for the efficient and accurate learning of new classes sequentially.

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to the common variants of continual learning, federated learning iteratively trains a common model under the direction of a central server on data that is decentralized across many devices, such as mobile phones. Federated learning can reduce communication overhead and privacy concerns by removing the need to send the raw source data back to a server for traditional, centralized machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. The goal in federated learning has traditionally been to learn a shared parameterization from decentralized data, but not necessarily to learn <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">new</span> concepts or classes online on different clients while preserving that discriminative information
when communicating between client and the server. Recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yoon et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> discusses federated continual learning yet assumes that each client learns distinct tasks. While they address federated continual learning directly, the authors do not consider the direct sharing of knowledge of classes. Instead they assume that each client is learning its own task and they focus on reducing interference when transferring the network’s parameters, but not on merging explicit knowledge of classes that have been seen by the clients. In many cases, it would instead be useful if the server model could learn a single task with a growing set of classes by incorporating knowledge of classes learned on client devices. Such a unified, class-incremental learning model could be valuable to users of mobile devices, intelligence operations, robotics, or any situation in which new concepts should be learned and shared between distributed clients when efficient communication, privacy, and/or fast learning are paramount. Because this work builds on the motivation of federated learning but with the explicit goal of ascertaining knowledge of new concepts that can be efficiently communicated and reused, we call this problem federated reconnaissance.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated reconnaissance poses a unique set of challenges. An effective federated reconnaissance system must tackle efficient in situ learning of new classes and knowledge-preserving transfer. To these ends, we systematically study different approaches to solving this problem including running stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on new data as it appears as an empirical lower bound, an iCaRL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rebuffi et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> algorithm adapted for federated reconnaissance, an extension of prototypical networks for distributed, continual learning, and, finally, SGD on the joint distribution of all training data from all clients as an empirical upper bound.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">To test this claim, we present two simple algorithms for using prototypical networks for federated reconnaissance and evaluate them on the federated reconnaissance mini-ImageNet benchmark, showing that they outperform the lower bound and iCaRL models handily in both accuracy and computational complexity. We go on further to present pretraining methods that increase the accuracy of prototypical networks on the federated reconnaissance mini-ImageNet benchmark. Additionally, to put federated prototypical networks into the context of previous work, we show that they substantially outperform recent state of the art works on few-shot continual learning from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Javed and White (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Beaulieu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. It is also worth noting that prototypical networks have stronger privacy protection than existing class-incremental replay-based learning algorithms such as iCaRL since the transfer of raw examples is avoided and as long as a minimum set of examples per class are averaged on each client. We leave the empirical and theoretical work of differential privacy for federated prototypical networks to future work.</p>

Collective ascent is trivial to identify in centralized model training with distributed example gathering as it only amounts to greater data collection. In contrast, collective ascent is non-trivial to produce during federated reconnaissance when compute or bandwidth are limited and
centralized retraining on all observed examples is not an option because collective ascent entails positive forward <span id="S1.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">and</span> backward transfer<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>See <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Riemer et al.

interference in the context of continual learning.</span></span></span> during distributed continual learning.
We demonstrate collective ascent on the federated reconnaissance mini-ImageNet benchmark, highlighting, in concert with our other results, that the simple procedure of sharing feature vectors representing shared concepts is an important avenue for federated reconnaissance and continual learning more generally.</p>

The original iCaRL algorithm was developed for the single client scenario and has no inherent notion of model merging. We took inspirations from FederatedAveraging algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> to make it work on the federated reconnaissance problem. Whenever each client goes to mission, it obtains an initial set of parameters from the server. During a mission, the client sees a number of examples from new classes it has not seen before and trains the model on those new classes and some examples from base classes that are stored in a set of exemplars stored by the iCaRL model. To resist catastrophic forgetting, the model is trained with a distillation loss on base exemplars and the cross entropy loss on exemplars from new classes. After the mission is complete, each client provides its new model and exemplars from new classes to the server. The server then gets models from multiple clients and merges them by averaging the common parameters from those clients. For each new class, a new neuron is added to the fully connected layer of the model and the weights are copied from the fully connected layer of the client model corresponding to the class being added. If more than one client learned the same class, the neuron parameters are averaged, again similarly to the FederatedAveraging algorithm. This averaged model serves as an initial model which is further fine-tuned on base exemplars and new classes exemplars using gradient descent on the server. This model initialization can be thought of as a meta-initialization similar to Reptile <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nichol et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> where each client update training can be regarded as the task specific training and the model merging can be thought of as an update in the Reptile model with a meta-learning rate equal to 1. This final model serves as an initialization for next client going on a mission.</p>

This model serves as an empirical upper bound and comes at the storage and communication cost of saving and transferring all examples seen by all clients back to the server after each mission and retraining on all this data anytime new classes or examples are to be learned. Due to excessive computational expense, we did not evaluate the Upper baseline on the entire multi-mission Federated Reconnaissance Benchmark. Instead, we evaluated the model once by training with all training data of all classes, in the same way it would have been evaluated at the end of the benchmark.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">We propose to use prototypical networks to efficiently learn new classes in sequence. Given that prototypical networks are not gradient-based at test-time, they can be made to be robust to catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes by discriminative pretraining on a sufficiently large number of classes. When evaluated on a federated reconnaissance benchmark, we can compute an unbiased estimate of the mean (and the variance if we so desire) for each class by simply storing the previous prototype (, variance,) and the number of examples used to compute the previous prototype.

we instead can compute an unbiased running average for each prototype by storing the previous prototype and the number of examples used to compute it:</p>

We find that applying dropout with a droprate of 0.2 in the embedding space significantly improves learning new classes.

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate federated reconnaissance, a new benchmark was required. Taking inspiration from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Javed and White (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, we adapted the popular mini-ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vinyals et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> dataset in order to create the mini-ImageNet Federated Reconnaissance Benchmark. The mini-ImageNet dataset is composed of 100 classes taken from the Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Russakovsky et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, with 600 examples each. We split the classes in half, yielding 50 base classes for pretraining and 50 field classes for online learning. Base classes are not seen again during online learning. The examples for each class are split into 500 training examples and 100 test examples for each class. In the default parameterization of the benchmark, we instantiate 5 clients and, during online learning, for each mission we sample 5 classes per client from field classes and 30 images per class. We resize all images to <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="84\times 84" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">84</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">84</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">84</cn><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">84</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">84\times 84</annotation></semantics></math>. We sample examples without replacement and the evaluation ends when all training examples have been sampled.

We leave root causing these issues and the development or more numerically robust online prototype computation to future work.
It is also clear from the results shown in figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Federated Reconnaissance ‣ 5 Results ‣ Federated Reconnaissance: Efficient, Distributed, Class-Incremental Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that the 4-layer convolutional model substantially outperforms the resnet-18 model across learning algorithms except for the upper baseline.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have presented federated reconnaissance, a new a class of learning problems in which distributed clients learn new concepts independently and must be able to communicate that knowledge efficiently. We proposed an evaluation framework and evaluated a number of baseline learning algorithms for distributed continual learning. In particular, we derive simple algorithms for efficiently leveraging prototypical networks and find that they are a strong baseline method for federated reconnaissance  and class-incremental continual learning. These results suggest that the simple idea of passing feature vectors is an important avenue for future research on federated reconnaissance  and continual learning more generally. In future work, we plan to extend this research to openset problems and out-of-distribution class identification on larger benchmarks.</p>

We trained the resnet-18 and the 4 layer convolutional network backbones using stochastic gradient descent up to 200 epochs with an initial learning rate 0.01, weight decay 1e-2, Nesterov momentum 0.9, and step learning rate decay with step size 50 and gamma 0.1. Validation dataset from 50 base classes is used to select the best model. The hyper-parameters for the online updates during federated reconnaissance evaluation are chosen by training the base model on 40 base classes and updating the model on a hold out set of 10 evaluation classes.</p>

The temperature parameter for the distillation loss is set to 2. We used a budget of 4000 total examples. Examples are chosen at random to maintain in the cache, balancing across classes, meaning that there are 40 examples for each of the 100 mini-ImageNet  classes that are stored, transferred between client and server, and used for training. After the model is merged, 50 steps of stochastic gradient descent are carried out on base exemplars and new class exemplars with a learning rate 0.01, weight decay 1e-3, Nesterov momentum 0.9, and step learning rate decay with step size 30, and gamma 0.1.</p>
