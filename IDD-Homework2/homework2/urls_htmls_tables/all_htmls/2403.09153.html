<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In the rapidly advancing field of federated learning (FL), ensuring efficient FL task delegation while incentivizing FL client participation poses significant challenges, especially in wireless networks where FL participants’ coverage is limited.
Existing Contract Theory-based methods are designed under the assumption that there is only one FL server in the system (i.e., the monopoly market assumption), which in unrealistic in practice.
To address this limitation, we propose <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>airness-<span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>ware <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Mu</span>lti-<span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>erver FL task delegation approach (<span id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span>), a novel framework based on Contract Theory and Lyapunov optimization to jointly address these intricate issues facing wireless multi-server FL networks (WMSFLN).
Within a given WMSFLN, a task requester products multiple FL tasks and delegate them to FL servers which coordinate the training processes.
To ensure fair treatment of FL servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, <span id="id1.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span>
establishes virtual queues to track their previous access to FL tasks, updating them in relation to the resulting FL model performance.
The objective is to minimize the time-averaged cost in a WMSFLN, while ensuring all queues remain stable.
This is particularly challenging given the incomplete information regarding FL clients’ participation cost and the unpredictable nature of the WMSFLN state, which depends on the locations of the mobile clients.
Extensive experiments comparing <span id="id1.id1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span> against five state-of-the-art approaches based on two real-world datasets demonstrate that it achieves 6.91% higher test accuracy, 27.34% lower cost, and 0.63% higher fairness on average than the best-performing baseline.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the evolving landscape of machine learning (ML), centralized learning approaches have traditionally taken the center stage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
As data generation scales up and concerns about data privacy become more widespread, such an approach faces inherent challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
A promising way out of this gridlock is federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which is a decentralized learning paradigm where devices, from smartphones to industrial IoT sensors, perform localized model training and collaboratively build global ML models.
Rather than transmitting raw data, only model updates are uploaded to an FL server for coordination and aggregation, thereby achieving enhanced privacy preservation and the ability to utilize diverse, real-world data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
This salient feature of FL is further empowered by the development of wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Today, exploring FL in the context of wireless networks emerges as an important field of research in areas such as connectivity, scalability, real-time collaboration, and energy efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Navigating the complexities of optimizing FL for practical applications, we are presented with challenges that span both technical and economical dimensions.
Among the early contributions in the technical dimension, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> focused on proving the balance between computation and communication is crucial theoretically and experimentally.
Since FL requires constant communication between FL server and different mobile clients to continuously refine the model until convergence is achieved, it induces complex dynamics: the pursuit of higher local accuracy requires a large number of clients committing more computational resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Delving deeper, however, and the economic dimension becomes an equally compelling problem. The iterative nature of FL requires the ongoing engagement of numerous clients who need to be motivated.
Furthermore, it is unrealistic to expect clients to consistently participate throughout the FL training process, especially considering the inherent mobility of FL client devices and their Thus, incentives need to be provided to motivate FL client participation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A typically FL incentive mechanism needs to perform three distinct tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>: 1) FL task delegation, 2) FL client contribution assessment, and 3) allocation of rewards.
One of established theoretical tools for incentive mechanism design is the Contract Theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Contract theory focuses on the formulation of optimal agreements among parties with distinct interests and varying degrees of information.
In FL, two main lines of research for Contract Theory-based incentivization can be identified depending on the assumptions: 1) asymmetric contracts, and 2) multi-dimensional contracts. In the first branch, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> addressed the information asymmetry between the FL server and FL clients. They link resources to rewards via contract lists, focusing on local computing power as a decision variable, and operating under a scenario with limited knowledge about a client’s type.
The second branch delves into the provisioning of multi-dimensional resources in FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the authors formulated contract design using dataset size and communication time as key parameters. They suggest that
adhering to communication constraints can simplify the incentive mechanism, thereby deriving optimal rewards and establishing benchmarks for dataset size and maximum communication duration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Existing Contract Theory-based methods are designed under the assumption that there is only one FL server in the system (i.e., the monopoly market assumption). This assumption is unrealistic in practice.
In addition, they also do not adequately address the challenge facing FL in wireless networks in which mobile devices (i.e., FL clients) have limited communication coverage, forcing FL server to only work with clients it can directly reach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To bridge these important gaps, we propose <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>airness-<span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>ware <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Mu</span>lti-<span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>erver FL task delegation approach (<span id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span>).
It draws upon Contract Theory and Lyapunov optimization to manage task delegation in the context of providing incentives to FL clients in a wireless multi-server FL network (WMSFLN) setting.
Under our problem setting, multiple FL servers coexist with a task requester (TR) which is responsible for delegating FL task requests to the FL servers.
The TR’s service area is segmented into clusters, each managed by one FL server.
Since clients can move freely throughout the entire area, the candidate client pool for each FL server changes dynamically.
Thus, <span id="S1.p5.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span> is designed to balance the performance and fairness during task delegation.
Mobile clients are categorized based on their associated participation costs.
FL servers offer contracts comprising various items that control the participation decision and rewards for specific client types, with the goal of eliciting truthful type information from clients while minimizing time-averaged WMSFLN cost.
Following Lyapunov optimization, <span id="S1.p5.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span> can deal with the unknown distribution of clients and the time-coupled queue stability constraints. For enhanced scalability, the task delegation and participants are controlled independently by each FL server based only on local information.</p>

These techniques are mainly employed by node selection (<span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a.k.a.</span> client selection) and payment allocation. Among the contributions in the area of game theory-based incentive mechanisms, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> developed the Stackelberg game-based incentive framework to optimize clients recruitment for utility maximization during training. In the spirit of these works, Weng <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et. al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> focused on designing incentive mechanism based on Bayesian game theory, emphasizing privacy protection, truthfulness, and accuracy.

FL’s security and privacy can be enhanced by incorporating blockchain into incentive mechanisms, leveraging its inherent robustness and tamper-resistance features. Bao <span id="S2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et. al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed FLChain, building a transparent, trust, and incentive FL ecosystem. Similarly, Toyoda <span id="S2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et. al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> used contest theory to model and analyze an incentive-aware mechanism for blockchain-assisted FL system. In the following, we briefly summarize the related work of contract theory-based incentive mechanisms.
Contract Theory focuses on the formulation of optimal agreements among parties with distinct interests and varying degrees of information.
However, there are only a limited number of Contract Theory-based studies on FL.
Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> adopted Contract Theory to motivate high-quality FL clients to perform model updates, thereby eliminating unreliable ones.
In addition, they extended this approach by integrating Contract Theory with reputation modeling and blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to help FL servers gain deeper understanding about clients’ behaviour patterns.
A notable study that provides a theoretical analysis of multi-dimensional incentive mechanism design in FL, considering three distinct levels of information asymmetry can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
A multi-dimensional Contract Theory-based reliable incentive mechanism was designed for the UAV-aided Internet-of-Vehicles scenario <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Lu <span id="S2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et. al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> focused on fairness-aware, time-sensitive task allocation in asynchronous FL and developed a multi-dimensional Contract-Theoretic approach to optimize FL model accuracy.</p>

This definition can be analogously viewed in the context of the client reputation model, as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Different from existing works focusing on client reputation model design, we first measure the service quality of FL server to the assigned task by accuracy loss.

These steps aim to reduce the overall WMSFLN cost.
However, it is essential to recognize that each client, being rational, will only agree to rewards that optimize their individual payoffs.
Thus, WMSFLN needs to offer suitable incentives to motivate clients to participate in FL training tasks. By doing so, it can also reduce the buildup of virtual queue backlogs.
The ensuing section introduces a novel framework that combines Contract Theory with Lyapunov optimization to address the conflicting objectives between the WMSFLN (i.e., TR) and clients, thereby ensuring fair task allocation despite the incomplete knowledge regarding the specific types of clients’ participation.</p>

Two distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are employed for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
The MINIST CNN (MnistCNN) consists of two convolutional layers with dropout, two fully connected layers, and employs ReLU activation and max pooling, outputting through a log softmax function. In contrast, the CIFAR CNN (CifarCNN) features two convolutional layers followed by max pooling, three linear layers, and also uses ReLU activation, culminating in a log softmax output.
Both architectures are tailored to efficiently process their respective datasets, leveraging convolution, pooling, and activation techniques to optimize performance.</p>

As can be seen, the WMSFLN cost decreases as the number of types increases but increases with an increasing number of clients.
By contrast, the accuracy loss increases as the number of types, <math id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Gamma," display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.2.2"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">Γ</mi><mo id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.2.2.1">,</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">Γ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1c">\Gamma,</annotation></semantics></math> increases, but decreases as <math id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> increases.
This in essence attributes to the fact that a decrease in the number of types corresponds to a reduction in the value of the highest type.
Consequently, this leads to a heightened participation cost for clients, thereby contributing to an increased WMSFLN cost.
Notably, with regard to accuracy loss, a reduced number of types facilitates the recruitment of high-quality of participants.
This aligns with the prior observation that a few high-quality participants often outperform a large number of staggers in FL.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed the <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span> approach based on Contract Theory and Lyapunov optimization to perform joint task delegation and incentivization in WMSFLN.
To guarantee fair task delegation in WMSFLN, <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span> introduced virtual queues to tracked previous access to FL tasks and are updated based on the performance outcomes of the resultant FL models.
The objective is to minimize the time-averaged cost in a WMSFLN, while ensuring all queues remain stable.
This is challenging due to the limited information on the FL clients’ participation cost and the volatile nature of WMSFLN states, influenced by the locations of mobile clients.
Extensive experimental results show that <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FAMuS</span> achieved 27.34% lower cost, 6.91% higher test accuracy, and 0.63% higher fairness on average than the best-performing baseline.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Contract Theory-based FL fair task delegation approach that supports multiple FL servers with limited wireless network coverage coordinating FL training involve FL clients with mobility.</p>
