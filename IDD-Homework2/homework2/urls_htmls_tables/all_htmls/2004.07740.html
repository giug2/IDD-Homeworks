<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Humanity is collecting data at an unprecedented level – and very often this data is sensitive. Scientific studies across disciplines often rely on private information. Government agencies hold confidential data about their citizens. And companies – think Facebook, Google or Twitter – are recording individuals’ (online) behavior. Ideally, all this data could be shared: Scientists could draw from the same sources to jointly advance knowledge; citizens could use public sector data to hold governments accountable; and companies could externalise data services. However, important privacy concerns do not allow to freely circulate all these records.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Is it really necessary to share the data itself? Most data users care about the statistical information in the data and not so much about learning sensitive traits. A possible solution for sharing such statistical information is synthetic data: an artificial copy of the original data-set that ideally shares the same statistical properties. Analysts can work with synthetic data as if it were the original data and reach similar conclusions. In addition, synthetic data introduces a first layer of privacy protection. The individual records are completely synthetic and do not exist in real life. Nevertheless, synthetic data can still reveal sensitive information. If a strong outlier – say e.g. Bill Gates – is in the original data, the laws of statistics dictate that the synthetic version of the data reproduce his record almost perfectly. Just like any other data, synthetic data requires privacy protection, ideally in a principled and future proof way. Differential Privacy is such a privacy standard and it has recently attracted a lot of attention in academia, business and government agencies alike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abowd &amp; Schmutte, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Dwork et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>. It offers mathematically proven privacy guarantees without making assumptions about the distribution of the original data, available side knowledge or computational power. Differentially private synthetic data brings both of these concepts together and allows to share statistical information with privacy guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">But synthetic data needs to be not only private, it also needs to be useful. The ultimate goal of this paper is therefore to improve the methods that can release high-quality differentially private synthetic data. Differentially private data synthesizers protect privacy by adding noise to the original statistical information. But the noise runs the risk of blurring this information. Algorithms to synthesize differentially private data have become increasingly available and they perform well in pilot studies with benign (toy-)data. Often, this work still fails to live up to the challenges data users typically face: in the wild, micro data<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>“Micro data are unit-level data obtained from sample surveys, censuses and administrative systems. They provide information about characteristics of individual people or entities such as households, business enterprises, facilities, farms or even geographical areas such as villages or towns. They allow in-depth understanding of socio-economic issues by studying relationships and interactions among phenomena. Micro data are thus key to designing projects and formulating policies, targeting interventions and monitoring and measuring the impact and results of projects, interventions and policies.” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Benschop et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite></span></span></span> can contain discrete and continous attributes; it can have missing data; certain combinations of variables might not make a lot of sense – e.g. pregnant men; or data structures can be nested such as individuals in groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To advance the field, it is necessary to better understand the trade-off between data privacy and data quality. While a lot of attention rightly focused on establishing strong privacy guarantees, the next step has to consider the resulting data quality more closely <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abowd et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>; Elliot &amp; Domingo-Ferrer, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Hundepool et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. We therefore formulate a user-centric framework that measures the quality of synthetic data along two dimensions. First, while in some cases data needs to be similar to training data, in other cases the underlying ’unknown’ population data is playing a more vital role. Second, quality can be expressed in general terms with regards to the overall distribution, or in specific terms to address two main interests of the applied data user – inference and prediction.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Even though our framework is specifically designed for the purpose of private synthetic data, it generalises well to other forms of synthetic data, too.</span></span></span> Building on scenarios that describe applied researchers’ main data related obstacles, we suggest two different ’disciplines’ in which a differentially private data synthesizer should perform well: resulting synthetic data needs to be useful at different levels of privacy guarantees and also at different training set sizes. We maintain a dedicated homepage to keep track of the performance of differentially private data synthesizers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our paper addresses several audiences. First, we turn to applied researchers who typically use micro data and offer an overview about state-of-the art possibilities of generating differentially private synthetic data. Second, we reach out to those with a rigorous understanding about how to develop differentially private data synthesizers. In spotlighting current limitations, we intend to point to avenues for future research. Our hope is to ultimately spark a fruitful conversation between applied researchers, Statisticians and Computer Scientists about really useful privacy preserving synthetic micro data.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Differentially private GANs (DP-GANs) were the first class of models to synthesize differentially private data sets from different domains and for different uses. In existing studies, quality is either assessed by looking at the visual quality of generated images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(e.g. Xie et al., <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Frigerio et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Torkzadehmahani et al., <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> or the classification evaluation of a classification/prediction task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(e.g. Beaulieu-Jones et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Yet, there is no clear definition of what data quality actually implies beyond these measures. In the absence of natural measures, it is more difficult to assess the overall quality of synthetic data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The question what a useful DP data synthesizer actually is depends on the user. From the perspective of a data analyst who ultimately has to work with synthetic data, there are three core challenges. First, the synthetization process has to preserve statistical properties. Second, the data synthesizer has to be able to live up to the challenge of the realities of applied researchers’ data. Ultimately, DP data synthetization needs to occur in typical scenarios of different sample sizes and different privacy requirements.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Differentially Private Data Synthetization from a Statistical Viewpoint</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Applied researchers may have different expectations when they analyse private synthetic data. Some are interested in rather descriptive analyses of their data. They consider their data not as a sample from what potentially could be a larger population of data sets. This is the case whenever the original data captures a unique data source. For example, studies on political elites such as candidate studies for elections comprise all available data; or data on banking transactions that help identify money laundering are typically also unique instances. Data users analyse this kind of data with a descriptive goal in mind. They do not assume a larger population behind this data about which they want to draw inferences. All their analyses run with differentially private synthetic data should ideally lead to similar results as the analyses using the original data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In other cases, analysts may want to do more. The training data the DP synthesizer has to learn from is only a sample of many more possible data sets drawn from a larger population. The analyst might be interested in estimating the value of population parameters. In a similar vein, out of sample prediction works well if a model trained on differentially private synthetic data is capable of generalising beyond the training set itself. The model then has to be able to capture information about the process that generates data in the population in the first place.</p>

Indeed, data can be continuous. More often, however, micro-data is discrete. Categories could be ordinal or without any particular natural order to them. Structural zeros preclude logically impossible values such as pregnant three-year-olds. Often, parts of the data are missing -– either at random or not at random. Finally, data structures can be nested. In time series data, the same individual might be observed at different points in time. In hierarchical data, individuals are part of a larger group that comes with its own measurements, such as students in a classroom.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Data quality is context dependent. Measures for the quality of differentially private synthetic data should reflect the needs of those who work with this kind of data. We suggest to distinguish between quality measures along two dimensions.The first dimension distinguishes between the similarity of the differentially private synthetic data to the training data (i.e. the data that was used to generate the synthetic data) and the generalization properties of the differentially private synthetic data. On the one hand, data users might be particularly concerned with the similarity of differentially private synthetic data to the original training data. On the other hand, data users might care less about similarity of the data set to one particular training set. Instead, data analysts may be interested in inferring information about the underlying population – to either identify relationships between variables or build models for out-of-sample predictions.</p>

General data quality describes the overall distributional similarity between the real data and synthetic data sets. In turn, to reflect specific analyses data analysts expect to run on synthetic data we introduce specific data quality.

<p id="S3.p5.2" class="ltx_p">To compare the overall similarity of the joint distribution and to calculate the general quality of the synthetic copies we rely on the propensity score mean squared error (pMSE) ratio score for synthetic data as proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Snoke et al. (<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. The pMSE requires training a discriminator (e.g. a CART model) that is capable to distinguish between real and synthetic examples. A synthetic data set has high general data quality, if the model cannot distinguish between real and fake examples. It is possible to approximate the pMSE by resampling the null distribution of the pMSE. The pMSE ratio score divides the pMSE with the expectation of the null distribution. A pMSE ratio score of 0 would indicate that the synthetic and real data are identical.

When using private synthetic data in this setting, the data analyst needs to account for three layers of random errors in this data, first sampling error when drawing the training data from the underlying population, second model uncertainty when training the data synthesizer (even without Differential Privacy) and third the privacy noise that is introduced to the training of the data synthesizer to release differentially private synthetic data.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We envision a data challenge that tests differentially private data synthesizers for potentially different data scenarios (e.g. the baseline scenario, missing data, nested data) in the two related disciplines (training data size and privacy budget). For the challenge, we measure data quality according to Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3 A General Framework to Evaluate the Quality of Private Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. For a quick comparison of different differentially private data synthesizers we summarize the measures in an easy to read chart (see Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 The Data Challenge ‣ 3 A General Framework to Evaluate the Quality of Private Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). In this hypothetical example, the yellow polygon displays the performance of a differentially private data synthesizer for the nine measures from above. The further out (the bigger) the edges of the polygon, the better the performance of a synthesizer in that domain. With this chart it is also easy to see whether a particular data synthesizer does well for some measures of data quality, while it fails for others. The ultimate goal should be to balance the performance for all measures.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Building on scenarios that describe applied researchers’ main data related obstacles we seek to contribute to the development of differentially private data synthesizers and propose a joint and unified benchmark. It is our hope that by formulating a problem that needs to be solved, we offer a focus point for further collaboration across disciplines. Our suite of well defined data generating processes illustrates typical challenges of applied researchers’ data, i.e. discrete data, structural zeros, missing data and nested data. Data generating algorithms should be able to account for these challenges in two different settings: at different levels of privacy and at different amounts of available training data. Finally, to assess the quality of the resulting synthetic data from the vantage point of applied researchers we introduce a set of appropriate data quality measurements along two dimensions: On the one hand similarity towards the training data or the underlying population, on the other hand general and specific data quality. All differentially private data synthesizers should ideally be capable of rising to these challenges under different settings: at different levels of privacy and with different training data sizes. They ideally also synthesize data that is similar to the training sample and generalizes well to the underlying population.
Differentially private synthetic data contributes to solving important current challenges. It offers principled privacy guarantees, opening the door to sharing data freely. Access to the statistical information in all the data currently collected promises to open the door wide to a great range of positive externalities – be they in science, government or business.</p>

<div id="S1a.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1a.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Humanity is collecting data at an unprecedented level – and very often this data is sensitive. Scientific studies often rely on private information. Government agencies hold confidential data about their citizens. And companies – think Facebook, Google or Twitter – are recording individuals’ (online) behavior. Ideally, all this data could be shared: Scientist could draw from the same sources to jointly advance knowledge; citizens could use public sector data to hold governments accountable; and companies could externalise data services. However, important privacy concerns do not allow to freely circulate all these records.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1a.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1a.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Is it really necessary to share the data itself? At the end of the day, most data users care about the statistical information in the data – and not so much about learning sensitive traits. A possible solution is synthetic data: an artificial copy of the original data-set that ideally shares the same statistical properties. Analysts can work with synthetic data as if it were the original data and reach similar conclusions. In addition, synthetic data introduces a first layer of privacy protection. The individual records are completely synthetic and do not exist in real life. Nevertheless, synthetic data can still reveal sensitive information. If a strong outlier – say e.g. Bill Gates – is in the original data, the laws of statistics dictate that the synthetic version of the data reproduce his record almost perfectly. Just like any other data, synthetic data requires privacy protection, ideally in a principled and future proof way. Differential Privacy is such a privacy standard and it has recently attracted a lot of attention in academia, business and government agencies alike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abowd &amp; Schmutte, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Dwork et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>. It offers mathematically proven privacy guarantees without making assumptions about the distribution of the original data, available side knowledge or computational power. Differentially private synthetic data brings both of these concepts together and allows to share statistical information with privacy guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1a.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1a.p3.1" class="ltx_p">But synthetic data needs to be not only private, it also has to be useful. The ultimate goal of this paper is therefore to improve the methods that can release high-quality differentially private synthetic data. Differentially private data synthesizers protect privacy by adding noise to the original statistical information. But the noise runs the risk of blurring this information. Algorithms to synthesize differentially private data have become increasingly available and they perform well in pilot studies with benign (toy-)data. Often, this work still fails to live up to the challenges data users typically face: in the wild, micro data<span id="footnote6" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">6</span>“Micro data are unit-level data obtained from sample surveys, censuses and administrative systems. They provide information about characteristics of individual people or entities such as households, business enterprises, facilities, farms or even geographical areas such as villages or towns. They allow in-depth understanding of socio-economic issues by studying relationships and interactions among phenomena. Micro data are thus key to designing projects and formulating policies, targeting interventions and monitoring and measuring the impact and results of projects, interventions and policies.” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Benschop et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite></span></span></span> is mostly discrete; it can have missing data; certain combinations of variables might not make a lot of sense – e.g. pregnant men; or data structures can be nested such as individuals in groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1a.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1a.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To advance the field, it is necessary to better understand the trade-off between data privacy and data quality. While a lot of attention rightly focused on establishing strong privacy guarantees, the next step has to consider the resulting data quality more closely <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abowd et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>; Elliot &amp; Domingo-Ferrer, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Hundepool et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. We therefore formulate a user-centric framework that measures the quality of synthetic data along two dimensions. First, while in some cases data needs to be similar to training data, in other cases the underlying ’unknown’ population data is playing a more vital role. Second, quality can be expressed in general terms with regards to the overall distribution, or in specific terms to address two main interests of the applied data user – inference and prediction.<span id="footnote7" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">7</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">7</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">7</span>Even though our framework is specifically designed for the purpose of private synthetic data, it generalises well to other forms of synthetic data, too.</span></span></span> Building on scenarios that describe applied researchers’ main data related obstacles, we suggest two different ’disciplines’ in which a differentially private data synthesizer should perform well: resulting synthetic data needs to be useful at different levels of privacy guarantees and also at different training set sizes. We maintain a dedicated homepage to keep track of the performance of differentially private data synthesizers<span id="footnote8" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">8</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">8</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">8</span><a target="_blank" href="http://privatesyntheticdata.github.io" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">http://privatesyntheticdata.github.io</a></span></span></span>.</p>

<p id="S1a.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our paper addresses several audiences. First, we turn to applied researchers who typically use micro data and offer an overview about state-of-the art possibilities of generating differentially private synthetic data. Second, we reach out to those with a rigorous understanding about how to develop differentially private data synthesizers. In spotlighting current limitations, we intend to point to avenues for future research. Our hope is to ultimately spark a fruitful conversation between applied researchers, Statisticians and Computer Scientists about really useful privacy preserving synthetic micro data.</p>

Synthetic data ideally preserves all relationships between variables. It should be possible to handle diverse data types (categorical, ordinal, continuous, skewed etc.). Computation needs to be feasible also for large data sets. Anybody generating synthetic data should have little work to do to tune the necessary algorithms. If done well, synthetic data has several important (theoretical) advantages over traditional statistical disclosure limitation methods such as data swapping, aggregation or cell suppression. The results are similar no matter whether an analysis is performed on the synthetic or original data. Also, theoretically, synthetic data can protect privacy more easily, because a synthetic data record is not any respondents’ actual data record. Finally, data users can draw valid inferences for a variety of estimands – without having to make any particular assumptions about how the synthetic data were created.</p>

<p id="S2a.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Differential Privacy is a principled privacy framework that helps mitigate the trade-off between sharing statistical information while protecting privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dwork, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>; Dwork &amp; Roth, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Wood et al., <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. It offers mathematically proven privacy guarantees while allowing to draw inferences about values in the population <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dwork et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. The key idea is to think about data protection from a relative perspective. What is the relative risk of disclosing information about an individual when running an analysis on a data base that includes their information vs. running an analysis on a data base that does not include their information? It is possible to quantify this privacy difference. Differential Privacy formulates upper bounds about the risk of disclosing information when querying a database in the presence or absence of any one observation. This does not mean that nothing can be learned about an individual: It rather means that if something can be learned about an individual, it does not matter whether an individual is in the data or not <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dwork &amp; Naor, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2a.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Combining synthetic data with Differential Privacy offers an appealing solution to a number of core challenges: Differentially private synthetic data allow to share statistical information while at the same time protecting privacy in a principled and future proof way. Synthetic data also offers a solution to the query-based limitations of the original Differential Privacy framework. Since Differential Privacy is perserved under post-processing, generating differentially private synthetic data spends the privacy budget only once. In result, any analysis that is run on differentially private synthetic data is also differentially private <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dwork &amp; Roth, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Wood et al., <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>

At first, GANs have been used to address privacy concerns more broadly, for example to protect privacy in images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(e.g. Tripathy et al., <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> or – in contrast – to attack privacy in the context of distributed learning setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hitaj et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. What ultimately makes GANs differentially private is the injection of the right amount of noise into the training process of the discriminator, since the generator only post-processes the output of the discriminator. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Abadi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> introduced differentially private stochastic gradient descent, laying an important foundation for later applications to GANs.A number of studies follow in their footsteps. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Beaulieu-Jones et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> generate differentially private synthetic data of a medical trial. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Xie et al. (<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> also produce differentially private medical data: they too ensure Differential Privacy by combining noise addition and weight clipping. Finally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Xu et al.

<p id="S2a.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Private synthetic data can only become a widespread means of disclosure control if it protects privacy while also sharing statistical information. The trade-off comes with a straightforward intuition: Adding privacy means adding noise – and the noise may affect the statistical information in the data. Even though data privacy is at the heart of research on statistical disclosure limitation, the utility of the resulting data has been a recurrent concern for the discipline in general <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Duncan &amp; Stokes, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>; Purdam &amp; Elliot, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>; Trottini &amp; Fienberg, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>; Taylor et al., <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Woo et al., <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> and for synthetic data as a means for privacy protection in particular <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Drechsler &amp; Reiter, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>; Drechsler, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Drechsler &amp; Shlomo, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Reiter, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005b</a>; <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">c</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2a.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2a.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Finding the “correct” settings in this trade-off is an optimisation problem.

Others consider the equilibrium between both to be more problematic. From a social choice perspective, privacy and data quality are public goods with actors who may have heterogenous preferences. A data curator – such as a statistical agency – can in practice set the optimal levels for privacy and quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abowd &amp; Schmutte, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.

<p id="S3a.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We develop our framework for data quality along the lines of the requirements of a typical data use case: A well intended data curator collects a random sample from a data generating process provided by nature. They have access to this original sample and they would like to share the statistical information. While they might have an idea about the models potential data analysts would typically run, they are ignorant about the exact nature of these analyses.

For example, studies on political elites such as candidate studies to elections comprise all available data; or data on banking transactions that help identify money laundering are typically also unique instances.

Unfortunately, while first synthesizers have proven themselves in the controlled settings of pilot studies, general models that are both secure and useful still need to improve to be really useful. In addition, little has been done to understand the algorithms’ statistical properties. To advance the development of differentially private micro data synthesizers, we propose a joint data challenge. We hope that it serves to coordinate efforts of scholars with backgrounds in various academic disciplines.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Applied researchers’ micro data have a number of characteristics that make it challenging to generate differentially private synthetic data for them. Indeed, data can be continuous. More often, however, micro-data is discrete. Categories could be ordinal or without any particular natural order to them. Structural zeros preclude logically impossible values such as pregnant three-year-olds. Often, parts of the data are missing -– either at random or not at random. Finally, data structures can be nested. In time series data, the same individual might be observed at different points in time. In hierarchical data, individuals are part of a larger group that comes with its own measurements, such as students in a classroom.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p5.2" class="ltx_p">To compare the overall similarity of the joint distribution and to calculate the general quality of the synthetic copies we rely on the propensity score mean squared error (pMSE) ratio score for synthetic data as proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Snoke et al. (<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. The pMSE requires training a discriminator (e.g. a CART model) that is capable to distinguish between real and synthetic examples. A synthetic data set has high general data quality, if the model cannot distinguish between real and fake examples. It is possible to approximate the pMSE by resampling the null distribution of the pMSE. The pMSE ratio score divides the pMSE by the expectation of the null distribution. A pMSE ratio score of 0 would indicate that the synthetic and real data are identical.

When using private synthetic data in this setting, the data analyst needs to account for three layers of random errors in this data, first sampling error when drawing the training data from the underlying population, second model uncertainty when training the data synthesizer (even without Differential Privacy) and third the privacy noise that is introduced to the training of the data synthesizer to release differentially private synthetic data.

Standardising and then averaging across all parameters gives an overall percentage value that summarises bias in general. The coverage rate of the variance captures efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Drechsler, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. How often does the 90% confidence interval include the true value from the population? Averaging across all samples and cases yields one single measure. Finally, an analyst might be interested in generating a model that is capable of predicting values for out-of-sample prediction. Here, we estimate a model on each of the synthetic datasets. We then predict values for unseen data in the held out validation sets and summarise all results with an average RMSE.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We envision a data challenge that tests differentially private data synthesizers for potentially different data scenarios (e.g. the baseline scenario, missing data, nested data) in the two related disciplines (training data size and privacy budget). For the challenge, we measure data quality according to Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Measuring Data Quality ‣ 4 A General Framework to Evaluate the Quality of Private Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. For a quick comparison of different differentially private data synthesizers we summarize the measures in an easy to read chart (see Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 The Data Challenge ‣ 4 A General Framework to Evaluate the Quality of Private Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). In this hypothetical example, the yellow polygon displays the performance of a differentially private data synthesizer for the nine measures from above. The further out (the bigger) the edges of the polygon, the better the performance of a synthesizer in that domain. With this chart it is also easy to see whether a particular data synthesizer does well for some measures of data quality, while it fails for others. The ultimate goal should be to balance the performance for all measures.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Building on scenarios that describe applied researchers’ main data related obstacles we seek to contribute to the development of differentially private data synthesizers and propose a joint and unified benchmark. It is our hope that by formulating a problem that needs to be solved, we offer a focus point for further collaboration across disciplines. Our suite of well defined data generating processes illustrates typical challenges of applied researchers’ data, i.e. discrete data, structural zeros, missing data and nested data. Data generating algorithms should be able to account for these challenges in two different settings: at different levels of privacy and at different amounts of available training data. Finally, to assess the quality of the resulting synthetic data from the vantage point of applied researchers we introduce a set of appropriate data quality measurements along two dimensions: On the one hand similarity towards the training data or the underlying population, on the other hand general and specific data quality. All differentially private data synthesizers should ideally be capable of rising to these challenges under different settings: at different levels of privacy and with different training data sizes. They ideally also synthesize data that is similar to the training sample and generalizes well to the underlying population.
Differentially private synthetic data contributes to solving important current challenges. It offers principled privacy guarantees, opening the door to sharing data freely. Access to the statistical information in all the data currently collected promises to open the door wide to a great range of positive externalities – be they in science, government or business.</p>

<div id="A1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The basic idea of a GAN is surprisingly intuitive. At its core, a GAN is a minimax game with two competing actors. A discriminator (D) tries to tell real from synthetic samples and a generator (G) intends to produce realistic synthetic samples from random noise. We use the same illustrative example as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Goodfellow et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> to make GANs (and the adjustments later on) more accessible: “The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistinguishable from the genuine articles.”</p>
</div>
<div id="A1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a GAN, the team of counterfeiters (Generator G) is a neural network which is trained to produce realistic synthetic data examples from random noise. The police (discriminator D) is a neural network with the goal to distinguish fake data from real data. The generator network trains to fool the discriminator network. It uses the feedback of the discriminator to generate increasingly realistic “fake” data that should eventually be indistinguishable from the original ones. At the same time, the discriminator is constantly adapting to the more and more improving generating abilities of the generator. Thus, the “threshold” where the discriminator is fooled increases along with the generator’s capability to convincingly generate data similar to the original data. This goes on until equilibrium is reached<span id="footnote18" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">18</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">18</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">18</span>Interestingly, a GAN is therefore a dynamic system where the optimisation process is not seeking a minimum, but an equilibrium instead. This is in stark contrast to standard deep learning systems, where the entire loss landscape is static.</span></span></span>.</p>
