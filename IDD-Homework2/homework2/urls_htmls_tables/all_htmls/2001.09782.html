<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">Deep learning has achieved great success in many applications. However, its deployment in practice has been hurdled by two issues: the privacy of data that has to be aggregated centrally for model training and high communication overhead due to transmission of large amount of data usually geographically distributed. Addressing both issues is challenging and most existing works could not provide an efficient solution. In this paper, we develop FedPC, a Federated Deep Learning Framework for Privacy Preservation and Communication Efficiency. The framework allows a model to be learned on multiple private datasets while not revealing any information of training data, even with intermediate data. The framework also minimizes the amount of data exchanged to update the model. We formally prove the convergence of the learning model when training with FedPC and its privacy-preserving property. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of FedPC in terms of the approximation to the upper-bound performance (when training centrally) and communication overhead. The results show that FedPC maintains the performance approximation of the models within <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="8.5\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">8.5</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">8.5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">8.5\%</annotation></semantics></math> of the centrally-trained models when data is distributed to 10 computing nodes.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The development of information technology makes the data collection and storage process much easier than ever. This leads to the explosion of the amount of data collected every day in any daily life aspects such as healthcare, business, manufacturing, security, to name a few. Analyzing such data provides a lot of useful insights that could help one anticipate business or reaction plans to improve their ultimate objectives or prevent damages due to negative events. Obviously, analyzing such a huge amount of data requires tools and software that automate the analytic process and achieve high throughput at least equal to the velocity of data collection so as to provide the analytic results as soon as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, in most of real-world applications, data, especially personal information, is generated and stored in data silos, either end-users’ devices or service providers’ data center. Most conventional machine learning and deep learning are trained in a centralized manner, requiring training data to be fused in a data server. In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), collecting and aggregating data from multiple sources incur significant communication overhead and network resource cost. It is even more difficult with resource-constrained devices such as IoT devices or in the area where network resources are limited such as developing countries.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The challenges are not only in the problem of transporting high-volume, high-velocity, high-veracity, and heterogeneous data across organisations but also in the data privacy issue as the data owners do not want their data to leave their premises, especially the data contains sensitive information such as medical records, bank transactions, security logs, etc. This privacy concern prevents the data owners from contributing their data to the training process even though they might know that their data could improve the model performance. This motivates us to develop a novel training framework that allows the model to be trained on different private datasets without relocating/gathering them to the same location. Without trusting any third parties including training coordinator and data owners, such a training approach needs to ensure that there is not any sensitive data leaked, thus preventing a data owner or training coordinator from inferring the data of other owners.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several works have addressed the above challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, these works either chosen to address only one of the challenges or compromised one for the other. For instance, Phong and Phuong <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> developed a privacy training algorithm that preserves the privacy of each private dataset in the ensemble training dataset but requiring a sequential training process through all the private datasets and model is repeatedly copied from one computing node to another computing node. Combining the two aforementioned challenges in an integrated framework is a hard problem that cannot be achieved just by adopting or combining the existing solutions altogether. Protecting the data privacy by keeping the data in the respective premise of the data owner requires a training framework that allows the data owner to exchange the model parameters learned with the data with the training coordinator that maintains a global model instance. Such a framework has to minimize the communication overhead, i.e., the amount of data exchanged, idle time of the training processes on different private datasets, and avoid revealing additional information about the data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we design and develop <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedPC</span>, a <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated Deep Learning Framework for <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P</span>rivacy Preservation and <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>ommunication Efficiency. The framework addresses the above challenges in an efficient manner. We consider a threat model that reflects practical scenarios where all the parties are honest-but-curious or some of them collude to attack a particular victim. The main contribution of the paper is summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We develop a communication protocol that allows a training worker (i.e., the training process runs on a particular private dataset) to inform the master (i.e., the training coordinator that has the global model instance) about the evolution of the model parameters without revealing any sensitive information. The protocol also minimizes the communication overhead, i.e., the amount of data exchanged among the master and workers during the training.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We develop a goodness function that quantifies the impact of a private dataset on the global model instance, thus determining how much the parameters of the global model instance should be updated based on the information obtained from the respective training worker. Since the information from different training workers may not provide the same update direction for a certain model parameter, the goodness function also allows us to determine the update direction for a certain parameter. We assume that the number of data samples in each private dataset is arbitrary: one may have a large number of samples while the other has much fewer samples. We also assume that the data samples in all the private datasets are stationary and have the same distribution. This relieves us from the concept of data drift and domain adaptation problems.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Conventional training techniques such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, deep descent derivatives are based on an iterative algorithm that updates the model parameters as the iterations proceed to converge to specific values say <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">optimal parameters</span>. The convergence speed (the number of iterations) depends on the learning rate and convergence condition set by the algorithm and usually requires a long-running time to complete. Many works in the literature have tried to speed up the convergence by considering different aspects including distributed storage of training data (i.e., data parallelism), distributed operation of computational tasks (i.e., model parallelism). In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, Li <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> analyzed different parallel frameworks for training large-scale machine learning and deep learning models.

Most of these frameworks are open-source and optimized by NVIDIA GPUs using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming interface.

The authors developed two network topologies for the exchange of model parameters: a master-worker topology and a fully-connected (peer-to-peer) topology. The communication among training peers, master and workers is secured by the standard Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, this work does not enable parallel training as the deep learning model is sequentially trained on the private datasets.</p>

However, while the training data is not shared among the training workers, an honest-but-curious attacker (who can be the master or a training worker) can collect the exchanged gradient values and infer the nature of the training dataset of a particular training worker. Further, this work does not consider secure communication to protect gradients against a man-in-the-middle attacker as well as communication cost.

The authors adopted a Key Transfer Server (KTS) and a Data Service Provider (DSP) that issue a Diffie Hellman (private) key for each of the training workers to encrypt the gradients before sending them to the master. This allows the training workers to securely communicate with the master without establishing an independent secure channel.</p>

The teacher models are then used to predict the label of incomplete public data. Finally, the predicted public data is used to train <span id="S2.SS3.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">student</span> models which will be released to use. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, Lyu <span id="S2.SS3.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> used blockchain technology to decentralize the learning process where each training worker does not trust any third party or other training workers.

The authors adopted differential privacy by adding noise to gradients so that no individual patient’s data has a significant influence on the global model, thus revealing the nature of the respective training data. Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, this work sequentially trains the model from one private dataset to the other, i.e., the weights obtained on one dataset are transferred to the next training worker to continue on a new dataset.</p>

However, if the server updates the weight by the ratio of the data size of the party, these approaches may not be useful since the party does not know the ratio itself. Compared to differential privacy, MPC increases the communication cost of parties since they have to communicate either by pair or together to share the generated secure information that has been used to encrypt the model before sending it to the server.

Federated learning allows the data owners to collaboratively train a model without sharing its data with others, thus protecting data privacy. <span id="S2.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FederatedAveraging</span> (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is one of the typical algorithms that was designed to train a machine learning model using multiple distributed datasets in a parallel manner. At each training step, a random subset of clients (i.e., training worker or data owner) is chosen and asked to train the model using their own dataset in parallel. Then, the clients send back the model parameters to the server to update the global model using an average formula. However, it does not consider reducing the data communication cost among clients and the server as well as data privacy.

These parameters are the private information of each worker and they are kept unknown to the master as well as other workers, thus preventing others from inferring useful information about the training data.

Thus, with the heterogeneity in hyper-parameters and the size of datasets, the training time will be different for different workers.

The cost of the model could be the loss function value, reconstruction error, such that the lower the value of the cost, the better the model instance obtained. Instead of sending the local model instance to the master, which may not be as good as the one from other workers and also incurs high communication overhead due to its large size, each worker first sends its respective cost to the master. We define a goodness function to determine the best local model instance and its respective worker based on its cost.</p>

Thus the goodness value of each model instance obtained from a worker after the first epoch is defined as the inverse of the per-unit cost. From the second epoch onward, the progress in the training will also be taken into account. Since the master has the information of the cost from the previous epoch, it can evaluate the training progress by computing the reduction in cost. A worker with a large number of data samples and a large reduction in cost will be obviously selected. However, if a worker with less data but still has a large reduction in training cost, it can be also a good candidate to update the global model instance.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We note that while we consider an honest-but-curious threat model in this work, it can happen that in reality, a compromised worker can choose to not follow the protocol and send adversarial information to the master. This leads to the fact that the learning model is no longer trustful and it can result in wrong predictions. However, this does not affect data privacy, i.e., the privacy of the training data, which is the main focus of our work. On one hand, the attacker at the compromised worker still cannot learn anything about the training data from other workers. On the other hand, the attacker cannot obtain a better learning model compared to the model trained on its local data, taking the advantage of the large training data from other workers, thus defeating the purpose of federated learning. It is also worth mentioning that addressing this challenging threat deserves a separate work. A possible solution is to adopt the Byzantine problem that has been extensively studied in networking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. With the Byzantine approach, the master (which is a trustful party) can verify the information received from workers before updating the model. Another possible approach is to randomly drop out several workers at each training epoch so as to avoid bias to a particular worker.</p>

Hence, the updated parameter based on the equation (<a href="#S3.E3" title="In 3.2 Master: Analyzing Training Outcomes from Workers and Updating Global Model ‣ 3 Federated Deep Learning Framework for Privacy Preservation and Communication Efficiency (FedPC) ‣ A Federated Deep Learning Framework for Privacy Preservation and Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) is basically contributed by the victim worker alone. Given a sufficiently large number of training epochs, these colluding workers can form a non-linear equation system to solve and infer the private dataset of the remaining worker.

Such performance drop is due to the fact that the model training does no longer benefit from the data shuffling after each training epoch. Shuffling on a private (smaller) dataset does not create much variance to update the model parameters. While CIFAR-10 is a benchmarking dataset, real-world datasets may be more heterogeneous, e.g., due to the quality of data collection devices. Additionally, to protect the data privacy, the proposed approach does not exchange the model parameters (i.e., weights and bias of neurons) as does Phong <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.Px1.p2.7.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>’s method and FedAvg.

Compared to the performance loss incurred with the CIFAR-10 dataset, the performance loss incurred with the LGGS dataset is much smaller and could be negligible. This high performance could be explained by the fact that the quality of data stored at different computing nodes is not much different from each other. Furthermore, this is a segmentation problem, the performance of the segmentation model (U-Net) is not affected by the imbalance of the data among workers as well as at each individual worker. We believe that such a slight performance drop could be acceptable in regards to the gain of data privacy, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

Since the number of training epochs with CIFAR-10 is high, the plot does not clearly show the behavior for the first few epochs. However, we can observe such a behavior in Figure <a href="#S5.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ Performance Convergence ‣ 5.2.2 Performance of FedPC ‣ 5.2 Performance Analysis ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ A Federated Deep Learning Framework for Privacy Preservation and Communication Efficiency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4b</span></a>. As such, the cost does not reduce significantly after the first few epochs before it starts converging to the minimum-achievable cost. This is explained by the fact that the workers in the proposed framework updates the master the evolution direction of model parameters rather than their absolute value or gradient. In other words, the master only know whether a parameter evolves in the same or oposite direction compared to that of the previous training epoch. Thus, the correct evolution can only be observed from the third training epoch onward. Combined with a small learning rate set for the training process, we obtained this behavior. Nevertheless, the training still converges, allowing the models trained with the proposed framework to approximate the performance of the models trained in the centralized manner.</p>

The total amount of data exchanged to complete the model training linearly increases along with the number of training epochs. For a fair comparison, we kept the same number of training epochs for both centralized training and distributed training of all algorithms, i.e., 250 epochs for ResNet50 FIXUP and 35 epochs for U-Net models. The experimental results show that our framework (FedPC) incurs the least communication overhead and offers the highest data privacy while achieving good performance approximation to the centralized training.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we designed and developed FedPC, a federated deep learning framework for privacy preservation and communication efficiency. FedPC allows a deep learning model to be trained in parallel on geographically-distributed datasets, which are assumed to be in the same data distribution. We defined a goodness function that helps the master evaluate the importance of the model instances obtained at the workers. The master holds a global model instance and updates it after each training epoch. We developed a ternarizing approach that allows the workers to inform the master about the evolution of the model on their local dataset without revealing the gradients and data samples. We formally proved the convergence of the models trained by our framework and the privacy-preserving properties guaranteed. We extensively carried out experiments with popular deep learning models that are used for diverse problems such as image classification and segmentation. The experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves the data protection without sacrificing the performance of the models (i.e., accuracy).
