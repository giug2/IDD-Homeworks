<p id="id14.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a popular collaborative learning approach that enables clients to train a global model without sharing their local data. Vertical federated learning (VFL) deals with scenarios in which the data on clients have different feature spaces but share some overlapping samples. Existing VFL approaches suffer from high communication costs and cannot deal efficiently with limited overlapping samples commonly seen in the real world.
We propose a practical vertical federated learning (VFL) framework called <span id="id14.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">one-shot VFL</span> that can solve the communication bottleneck and the problem of limited overlapping samples simultaneously based on semi-supervised learning. We also propose <span id="id14.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">few-shot VFL</span> to improve the accuracy further with just one more communication round between the server and the clients. In our proposed framework, the clients only need to communicate with the server once or only a few times. We evaluate the proposed VFL framework on both image and tabular datasets. Our methods can improve the accuracy by more than 46.5% and reduce the communication cost by more than 330<math id="id14.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id14.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id14.1.m1.1.1" xref="id14.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id14.1.m1.1b"><times id="id14.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id14.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id14.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math> compared with state-of-the-art VFL methods when evaluated on CIFAR-10.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning method that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without centralizing their raw data. Therefore, the clients can retain control over their own data assets. FL has received significant attention and has become a major research topic due to its capability to build real-world applications where datasets are isolated across different organizations/devices while preserving data governance and privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing approaches primarily focus on horizontal federated learning (HFL), where the data from different clients share the same feature space but have different samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. One application of HFL is that smartphones users collaboratively train a next-word prediction model for the smart keyboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In HFL, the clients are expected to learn the common knowledge from heterogeneous data distributions and produce a global model by aggregating the updates of local models. Hence, the main challenge of HFL is data distribution heterogeneity, and under cross-device scenarios, limited computation resources.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning (VFL), on the other hand, focuses on scenarios in which the data on clients have different feature spaces but share some overlapping samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. In addition, the true labels can reside on a third-party server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> as shown in <a href="#S1.F1" title="In 1 Introduction ‣ Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited Overlapping Samples" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. For example, a credit bureau collaborates with an e-commerce company and a bank to train a model to estimate a user’s credit score. In this case, only the credit bureau has the credit score of the users which will not be shared with the e-commerce company and the bank. VFL is mostly deployed in cross-silo scenarios, and the computation power is usually not a major concern <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, VFL faces two unique challenges. First, VFL requires the clients to communicate with the server for each iteration (rather than after several epochs under HFL) of training, which introduces extremely high communication costs. It is also notable that iterative communications require reliable communication channels between the server and the clients, which is usually expensive. In addition to the high communication cost, the other major challenge of VFL is that the number of overlapping samples may be limited. For example, two hospitals in different countries are not expected to have a large number of overlapping patients. The model trained with limited overlapping samples likely cannot achieve reliable performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, VFL is currently not as well explored as HFL. Some existing works can reduce the communication cost by reducing the communication frequency or compressing the communicated data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, most methods only achieve limited reduction from one local update to multiple, while still requiring heavy iterative communications. Other works focus on improving the performance with limited overlapping samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Notably, both challenges are bottlenecks of applying VFL in realistic scenarios, and leaving either one unsolved hinders the deployment of VFL in the real world. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work aiming at solving these two challenges simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">one-shot</em> VFL, which is a communication-efficient VFL algorithm that can achieve high performance with minimal overlapping samples. In one-shot VFL, the clients are guided to conduct local semi-supervised learning (SSL) using both the overlapping samples and the unaligned samples to train well-performing feature extractors. Under one-shot setting, the clients only need to conduct two upload operations and one download operation for the training session, which drastically reduces the communication cost and frequency. We further propose <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">few-shot</em> VFL as an extension of one-shot VFL. Few-shot VFL expands the supervised dataset on clients to improve the performance of the local feature extractors. Compared with one-shot VFL, clients in few-shot VFL conduct one more time of uploading and downloading, but can achieve better performance, especially when the number of overlapping samples is small.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Vertical Federated Learning.</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning (VFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> is the concept of collaboratively training a model on a dataset where the clients share some common samples but with different features on each client. VFL was first introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, where a federated logistic regression algorithm is proposed.
SecureBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposed a secure federated tree-boosting approach in the VFL setting and provided theoretical proof that it achieves the same level of accuracy as its centralized counterparts. Some other gradient boosting tree approaches for VFL include Pivot <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and VF<sup id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>Boost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. A federated random forest was also studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In addition to tree-based methods, other machine learning algorithms such as linear regression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and logistic regression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have been investigated under VFL settings. However, these algorithms are usually incapable of handling complex tasks such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), in which Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are preferred.
On the neural network side, SplitNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> was proposed to collaboratively train neural networks by splitting a neural network among participants and exchanging gradients and representations in each iteration. FATE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> implemented a framework that supports DNN in VFL.
Even though FATE improves the model’s capacity in VFL by supporting DNN, it still requires frequent communication between the participants for each iteration of training and therefore incurs significant communication costs as in previous VFL methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the communication cost, FedBCD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> was proposed to leverage stale gradients for conducting local training such that participants can decrease the communication frequency from one local update to multiple updates. However, frequent iterative communication is still required for the whole training process.
The other challenge is that the common samples across clients are usually limited in the real world, and training under such constraints may not achieve acceptable accuracy. FedCVT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposes to expand the training samples by estimating representations and labels but does not address the bottleneck of communication cost.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Privacy in VFL.</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy has become a concern of VFL since it was proposed because the clients need to send representations to the server for training, and privacy protection in VFL is well-explored. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> presents a secure protocol that is managed by a third party, the coordinator, by employing privacy-preserving entity resolution and an additive homomorphic encryption scheme. To improve data privacy and model security, FATE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> applies a hybrid encryption scheme in the forward and backward stages of training. To defend the label inference attack, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposes manipulating the labels following certain rules, which can be seen as a variant of label differential privacy (label DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> in VFL. Our paper focuses on the performance and communication efficiency of VFL. However, our method does not require the clients and the server to share additional information compared with existing VFL methods and is orthogonal to existing privacy-protecting techniques, which can be directly applied to our method.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Semi-supervised Learning (SSL).</h4>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">SSL aims at training a model with partially labeled data, especially when the amount of labeled data is much smaller than the unlabeled ones. There have been many SSL algorithms proposed over the years. SSL algorithms can be broadly categorized as consistency regularization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, pseudo-label methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and generative models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Consistency regularization is based on the assumption that if a realistic perturbation is applied to a data point, the prediction conducted by the trained model should not change significantly. MixMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> applies consistency regularization along with entropy minimization and generic regularization and can achieve similar accuracy as fully supervised training approaches. Pseudo-labeling has become a component of many recent SSL techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Such methods leverage the trained model to generate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data so that the labeled training dataset is expanded. Generative models (e.g., VAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>) are trained to generate images from the data distribution and can be transferred to downstream tasks for a given task with targets.</p>

FSSL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> learns inter-client consistency between multiple clients and splits model parameters for the server with labeled data and clients with unlabeled data separately.

However, these methods focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where the clients have the same feature space. Our work focuses on VFL settings where most clients have only partial features and no labels. In addition, existing deep SSL methods focus on imaging applications, while VFL has more potential for other types of data, such as tabular or multi-modal models combining imaging with other data types.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The detailed algorithm of one-shot VFL is shown in <a href="#alg1" title="In 4.1 One-shot Vertical Federated Learning ‣ 4 Methods ‣ Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited Overlapping Samples" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. It is notable that during the whole training process, the clients only need to upload representations to the server twice and download gradients from the server once, which is the reason we call it one-shot VFL. With such significant reduction from iterative download/upload to one-shot, we overcome the communication bottleneck in VFL. Meanwhile, local SSL conducted by clients fully utilizes the data of users that are unique to each client, and improves the performance under the realistic settings with limited overlapping samples.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Even though one-shot VFL can achieve high performance of the global model with extremely low communication cost, we consider improving the performance further by paying with a few more rounds of communication. The key factor to improve SSL performance is to have a larger labeled dataset. Thus, we propose to expand the supervised learning dataset on clients in VFL. One intuitive idea is to assign pseudo labels from local predictions to the unlabeled data points if those predictions have a high confidence. By doing this, we would only need to modify the local training procedure of one-shot VFL without introducing additional communication cost. However, there is one potential problem this method cannot solve. Considering a toy example shown in <a href="#S4.F4" title="In 4.2 Few-shot Vertical Federated Learning ‣ 4 Methods ‣ Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited Overlapping Samples" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Two clients participate in training a image classification task, and each client has access to a half of each image. If the two shapes on the image are the same, the image is positive, and negative if both shapes are different. If we want to improve the performance by enlarging the labeled dataset, the key is to generate pseudo labels with high accuracy. However, in this toy example, it is impossible for the clients to generate reasonable pseudo labels based on only half of the images since they do not have enough information to infer the true label of the image.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.5" class="ltx_p">To solve this problem, we propose few-shot VFL as shown in <a href="#alg1" title="In 4.1 One-shot Vertical Federated Learning ‣ 4 Methods ‣ Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited Overlapping Samples" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

FedBCD reduces communication cost compared with Vanilla VFL. However, it does not improve the accuracy of the model, and the communication reduction is not comparable with one-shot VFL. It is notable that FedCVT cannot achieve significant accuracy improvement compared with vanilla VFL, because the true label is extremely limited in our realistic setting. With extremely limited true labels, it is hard for the server of FedCVT to conduct SSL using only the estimated representations and pseudo labels.</p>

However, the communication reduction is still significant compared with baselines. In both one-shot VFL and few-shot VFL, clients train representation extractors first, then the server trains the classifier. To improve the accuracy further, we conduct end-to-end vanilla VFL after completing few-shot VFL to finetune the global model on CIFAR-10. It is shown that the end-to-end finetuning can improve the accuracy further. Even though the finetuning requires more communication rounds, it is still much more efficient compared with the baselines and offers the clients an option to further improve the performance.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Accuracy v.s. Times of Communication.</h4>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the communication cost, the times of communication needed between the clients are also an important metric to evaluate the communication efficiency. If the clients are required to communicate with the server continually (e.g., vanilla VFL), a stable and reliable communication channel between the server and a client will be necessary. In addition, if a client cannot upload its update to the server in one round of training due to network outage, all the other clients have to wait for it, which is extremely detrimental to the robustness and efficiency of the system. As shown in <a href="#S5.T1" title="In 5.2 Experimental results ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited Overlapping Samples" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Tab.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F7" title="In Accuracy v.s. Times of Communication. ‣ 5.2 Experimental results ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited Overlapping Samples" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, only three times of communications are needed for one-shot VFL, and the clients conduct SSL locally without waiting for the response from the server, which improves the efficiency significantly. FedBCD reduces the times of communication, but it is still not comparable to one-shot and few-shot VFL. In addition, continual communication between clients are still required for FedBCD, which cannot solve the bottleneck of communication efficiently. Few-shot VFL improves the accuracy further with only two additional times of communication between the clients and the server. During finetuning, the clients need to continually communicate with the server for multiple rounds. However, the clients do not need to communicate during as many rounds as for the other baselines. In practice, our one-shot and few-shot VFL can be used as pre-training techniques to achieve higher performance while significantly reducing the communication cost.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose one-shot VFL that applies SSL to solve two critical problems of VFL: high communication cost and limited overlapping samples common in the real world. In one-shot VFL, the clients only conduct two times of uploading and one time of downloading and can achieve higher accuracy than the SOTA VFL approaches. We also propose few-shot VFL to improve the performance further by paying with one more round of communication. We evaluate our methods on imaging data and tabular data, and the results demonstrate that our methods can improve the model performance under the settings with limited overlapping samples and reduce the communication cost significantly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, we will evaluate our VFL methods in multi-modal settings combining different data types. In addition, we note that data privacy preservation is a significant concern of deploying FL in real life <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Our methods do not require the clients and the server to share additional information compared with existing VFL methods besides the number of classes, which is common knowledge for both the server and clients in most settings.
Existing defense methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> can be directly incorporated into our approaches to improve privacy. In this paper, we follow most previous VFL literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and evaluate on two-client scenarios. We will explore multi-party settings in future work.
Our code will be made publicly available.</p>
