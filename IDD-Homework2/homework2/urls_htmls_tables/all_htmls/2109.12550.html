<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a core technology to provide learning models to perform complex tasks.
Boosted by Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), the number of applications relying on ML capabilities is ever increasing.
However, ML models are the source of different privacy violations through passive or active attacks from different entities.
In this paper, we present <span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>a proxy-based privacy-preserving system for federated learning to protect the privacy of participants against a curious or malicious aggregation server trying to infer sensitive attributes.
<span id="id6.id1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>receives the model updates from participants and mixes layers between participants before sending the mixed updates to the aggregation server.
This mixing strategy drastically reduces privacy without any trade-off with utility.
Indeed, mixing the updates of the model has no impact on the result of the aggregation of the updates computed by the server.
We experimentally evaluate <span id="id6.id1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>and design a new attribute inference attack, <span id="id6.id1.4" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\attackss</span>, exploiting the privacy vulnerability of SGD algorithm to quantify privacy leakage in different settings (i.e., the aggregation server can conduct a passive or an active attack).
We show that <span id="id6.id1.5" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>significantly limits the attribute inference compared to a baseline using noisy gradient (well known to damage the utility) while keeping the same level of utility as classic federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The collection of personal data is a subject firmly grounded in public debates.
The growing awareness of the population on privacy issues led to stronger regulations on data protection (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and contributed to the appearance of new services making privacy an incentive vector such as privacy-based search engine (e.g., Duckduckgo, Qwant), web browsing (e.g., Web Proxy, Tor, Brave), or mailing (e.g., Protonmail).
These services rely on infrastructures setup by companies, nonprofit organizations promoting privacy, or are fully peer-to-peer involving devices of end-users.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, personal and private data is still the fuel of all desires.
In this context, Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a core technology to analyze and provide learning models from large volumes of data and to perform complex tasks such as classifications, predictions or clustering.
The success of ML has driven different providers to launch Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) engines to make ML operation easier for anyone, without the cost and time to build in-house infrastructures.
These new services has led to an ever increasing number of new applications or services relying on ML capabilities in different domains such as computer vision, health analytic and speech recognition to name a few. However, it has been showed that ML models may leak information in the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">10.1145/2810103.2813677, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">song2020systematic, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhao2021infeasibility, </a>)</cite>. The fact that many applications using this technology involve the collection and processing of personal and sensitive data has raised privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">decristofaro2020overview, </a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite being popular, the memorization of training data by a ML model is the source of different privacy violations such as membership, property and attribute inference through passive or active attacks.
Membership inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Nasr_2019, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">jayaraman2020revisiting, </a>)</cite> refers to the capacity of an adversary to identify if a data point (or the data of an individual) has been used to train the target model. This attack has a serious privacy implication if the model is training with sensitive information (e.g., data from people with certain health status). Property inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">10.1145/3243734.3243834, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhang2020datasetlevel, </a>)</cite>, in turn, corresponds to the inference by an adversary of the properties of training data such as the features that characterize each class. This property inference can also concern a subset of the training inputs.
This ability to learn from training data is desired if the inference is directly related to the main task of the model.
By contrast, attribute inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">melis2018exploiting, </a>)</cite> corresponds to the fact that an adversary is able to infer an unintended and undesired attribute not correlated to class’s characteristic feature. Root causes related to these attack surfaces as well as the link between utility (e.g., through model overfitting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">song2020overlearning, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">8429311, </a>)</cite>) and privacy are not well understood.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">bonawitz2019towards, </a>)</cite> has emerged as promising privacy-by-design alternatives to decentralized learning schemes. In such a collaborative scheme, personal data never leaves the user device. Instead, devices (computing and refining a learning model with their own data) and a central server (aggregating models) work together to build a global learning model.
This new ML scheme has attracted many attention these last years, not only from the research community but also from major Internet companies, suggesting future deployments. For instance, Google envisioned to massively exploit FL in the near future (e.g., through its FLoC API <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">floc, </a>)</cite>).
While the FL scheme is a clear step forward towards enforcing users’ privacy, it still suffers from a large ML-based attack surface including membership, property and attribute inference from participants or from the server.
Different protection mechanisms to limit inference capabilities of an adversary have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">naseri2021robustness, </a>)</cite>.
For instance, some solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">vandermaaten2020tradeoffs, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">yu2020salvaging, </a>)</cite> are based on perturbation in order to reveal only a noisy information to the server, such as differential privacy. However, these solutions significantly damage the accuracy of the model and its capacity to converge.
Secure aggregation relying on a cryptographic scheme has been also proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">bonawitz2016practical, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">10.1145/3133956.3133982, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">10.1145/3372297.3417885, </a>)</cite>.
Similar to <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">MixNN</span>, this solution ensures that the server is only aware of the aggregate of all models, keeping the model of each participant (and the associated inference) private.
Beside the overhead of this solution remains low, the underlying cryptographic scheme requires the participation of the server in the protection.
We argue that such solutions are not deployed in practice.
Indeed, few companies accept to afford the additional cost of the protection. For instance, Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols which follow similar cryptographic scheme to protect the profile of users are not widely adopted in practice.
Moreover, a curious or malicious server trying to infer information from participants will certainly not adopt such a protection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">MixNN</span>, a new privacy-preserving service for FL against inference attacks from a curious or malicious aggregation server.
To achieve that, <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>relies on a proxy mixing the layers of the model updates among participants before sending them to the aggregate server.
Like Mixnets to ensure anonymity in information routing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">10.1145/358549.358563, </a>)</cite>, mixing the layers of the participants’ updates of neural network prevents inference attack without decreasing the accuracy of the aggregated model. This solution, albeit simple, leads to drastically improving the privacy without any trade-off with utility.
In addition, <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>is transparent to the FL service, participants only need to configure a web proxy for the associated traffic. To make the deployment of <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>easier by anyone (e.g., operate by an individual or non profit organizations willing to protect privacy) and possibly on an untrusted infrastructure, the proxy mixing the neural network layers is running inside an SGX enclave ensuring confidentiality and attestation on its behavior.</p>

More precisely, the server infers sensitive attributes of participants from their model updates.
These updates represent the gradient vectors which minimize their contribution to the model’s training loss.
These gradient vectors are consequently influenced by the local data of the user.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Neural networks are a family of ML models which have become popular for a variety of ML tasks.
A neural network is composed of multiple layers of non-linear mappings from input to intermediate hidden states (or hidden layers) and then to output where each layer transforms the output of the preceding layer to produce input for the next layer.
The topology of the connections between layers and the type of considered transformation function are task-dependent and impact the accuracy of the model.
For instance, convolutional layers account for locality where each neuron receives a restricted input space while a neuron receives the entire previous layer in a fully connected layer.</p>

Once the gradient is close to zero, the model has converged to a local minimum and the training is finished. The model is evaluated through its accuracy over testing data points not used to train the model.
The hyperparameters refer to the set of tunable parameters not related to the neural network (e.g., weights associated to connection) such as the number of training iterations, the size of the training batch or the learning rate.</p>

Each iteration contains three steps.
First, the aggregation server disseminates a global model to participants (step ❶ in the figure).
Each participant then trains and refines this model with its own data stored locally (step ❷).
After this local training, each participant holds its own variation of the model sent by the server.
Participants then send their updated model parameters to the aggregation server.
Finally, the server aggregates all these updates to generate a new global model (step ❸) which will be disseminated to participants in the next iteration.
Iteratively, the global model maintained on the server converges without requiring access to the personal data of participants.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By keeping locally data of the users on their device, FL improves privacy by design.
However, FL can disclose sensitive information via model updates that are based on the training data.
Indeed, any useful ML model reveals something about the population from which the training data was drawn. Indeed, a classifier model for instance may reveal the features that characterize a given class or help construct data points that belong to this class.
The first privacy violation is property inference: identification of the features that characterize each class, making it possible to construct representatives of these classes through model inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">10.1145/2810103.2813677, </a>)</cite>.
Another privacy violation is attribute inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">song2020overlearning, </a>)</cite>: the leak of personal and unintended information (i.e., properties that hold for certain subsets of the training data, but not generically for all class members).
The last privacy violation in our setting is membership inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">shokri2017membership, </a>)</cite>: given an exact data point, determine if it was used to train the model.</p>

This attack has a serious privacy implication especially if the learning model is related to sensitive information (e.g., presence of a certain pathology). Secondly, as deep-learning models come up with separate internal representations of all kinds of features, some of which are unpredictable and independent of the task being learned, the memorization of the training data can be leveraged by an adversary to infer a sensitive attribute <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">melis2018exploiting, </a>)</cite>.

The memory of an enclave is encrypted and cannot be directly accessed by other system software even by privileged code (e.g., the operating system or hypervisor).
Enclaves can be attested to prove that the code running in the enclave is the one intended, and that it is running on a genuine Intel SGX platform. Once attested, enclaves can be provisioned with secret data by using authenticated secure channels. Moreover, enclaves can persist secret data outside the trusted zone by using a sealing mechanism.
However, such protection comes with resource constraints.
More precisely, only 96 MB out of the 128 reserved for the enclave can be used by applications.

Depending on the considered model, the size of a model can be important and not fit into the memory limit of the enclave (96MB), requiring encrypted storage outside the enclave.
To avoid side-channel attack based on memory access, ORAM mechanisms (e.g., ZeroTrace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBLP:conf/ndss/SasyGF18, </a>)</cite>) can be adopted to carry out secure and oblivious access of data.

During one round, the gradient vector returned by a participant reflects how its local data have influenced the global model disseminated by the aggregation server at the beginning of the round.
This gradient vector is used as a fingerprint to infer the sensitive attribute.
This fingerprint can be amplified if the attack is conducted during multiple rounds.
Indeed, in this case, the influence of the user data on the evolution of the global model is more observable.</p>

For instance, with a balanced dataset over the gender, an accuracy above 50% indicates a data leakage through attribute inference attack. This indicates that the adversary is able to identify the gender of a participant with an accuracy higher than random guess.</p>

For CIFAR10, the federated learning model is trained on 3 local epochs for a size of data batch of 32 samples on each learning rounds, the server aggregates 16 users on each of the 10 learning rounds.
For MotionSense (and MobiAct), the training is (respectively) done on 2 (and 3) local epochs for batches of 256 (and 64) samples for each of the 20 learning rounds, and the server aggregates 20 users for MotionSense and 40 users for MobiAct.
For LFW, the training is done on 2 local epochs for batches of 16 samples for each of the 30 learning rounds, and the server aggregates 20 users.
For every datasets, we use the ”Adam” optimizer proposed by Tensorflow.
We use 5-fold cross-validation in which the testing set is randomly generated from 1/5 of the users. Reported results correspond to average over 5 repetitions of each experiment.
The experiments have been computed on a Laptop DELL, intel core i7 (i7-6600U) and 4G of RAM, using TensorFlow version 2.4.

To do that, the enclave receives the update parameters in an encrypted binary format and then decrypts and stores each layer of the updates in the trusted memory of the enclave.
We ran the experiment using the model designed for CIFAR10 (i.e., two convolutional layers and three fully connected layers). Each update consumes 26.9MB inside the enclave and is processed in 0.19s (0.17s for the decryption and 0.02s for the storage). The mixing operation spends only 0.03s on average in our experiment.
This processing time and the memory consumption are dependent on the size of the model. Using a model with three convolutional layers and three fully connected layers slightly increases this time to 0.22s and 51.3MB.
However, the constant processing time over all updates for a given model (i.e., the <span id="S6.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>proxy waits to receive a constant number of model updates before to mix them) reduces the surface for side channel attacks.

To address this data heterogeneity, several approaches have been proposed such as local adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">yu2020salvaging, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">arivazhagan2019federated, </a>)</cite> and clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">sattler2019clustered, </a>)</cite>.
Specifically, the clustering mechanism proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">sattler2019clustered, </a>)</cite> also leverages a similarity metrics between the model updates sent back by participants (similar to <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">MixNN</span>) to cluster the population.</p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Nasr_2019, </a>)</cite> designs passive and active inference algorithms for federated learning. However, this work only targets membership inference. In addition, while this attack also exploits the privacy vulnerabilities of the SGD algorithm, authors used a neural network to classify if a participant is a member of the training data or not a member.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhu2019deep, </a>)</cite> also exploits the gradient exchange to infer private training data of participants.
To do that, authors iteratively optimize ”dummy” inputs and labels to minimize the distance between dummy gradients and real gradients. Once the optimization finished, the dummy data is close to the private training data.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">jagielski2020auditing, </a>)</cite>, in turn, investigates the guarantees of differentially private SGD but via data poisoning attacks.</p>

<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Running <span id="S7.p3.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>in an Intel SGX enclave improves trust and confidentiality through an isolated execution environment.
However, this TEE is still vulnerable to side channel attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">206170, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">sgaxe, </a>)</cite>.
The most common countermeasure is to use data oblivious algorithms.
The objective of this technique is to eliminate the link between the nature of data inputs and the execution of the program (e.g., through the execution time or memory footprints).
To achieve that, the obfuscation technique consists to hide potential patterns by making them all uniform regardless of the considered data.
To reduce its inherent cost, the considered data oblivious algorithm needs to be chosen carefully according to the application <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">alam2020sgxmr, </a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented <span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">MixNN</span>, a proxy-based privacy-preserving framework to prevent attribute inference attacks conducted from a curious or malicious aggregation server exploiting the model updates.
<span id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>breaks the attribute footprint leaked in the model updates by mixing layers between multiple participants.
As this mixing strategy does not impact the result of the model aggregation performed by the server, the privacy improvement of <span id="S8.p1.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>does not compromise the utility of the model learned collaboratively.
We also designed <span id="S8.p1.1.4" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\attackss</span>, a new attribute inference attack which exploits the privacy vulnerability of the SGD algorithm. This attack can be passive or active. We experimentally evaluated <span id="S8.p1.1.5" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>with a standard image recognition bench-mark dataset and compared it against a state-of-the-art baseline using local differential privacy.
Results show <span id="S8.p1.1.6" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\name</span>provides the same model accuracy than a classical FL scheme (i.e., the same utility) while providing a better protection against attribute inference attack (i.e., a better privacy).</p>
