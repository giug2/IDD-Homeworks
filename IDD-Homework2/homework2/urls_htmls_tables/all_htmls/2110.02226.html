<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning setting that enables many devices to jointly train a shared global model without the need to reveal their data to a central server. However, FL involves a frequent exchange of the parameters between all the clients and the server that coordinates the training. This introduces extensive communication overhead, which can be a major bottleneck in FL with limited communication links. In this paper, we consider training the binary neural networks (BNN) in the FL setting instead of the typical real-valued neural networks to fulfill the stringent delay and efficiency requirement in wireless edge networks. We introduce a novel FL framework of training BNN, where the clients only upload the binary parameters to the server. We also propose a novel parameter updating scheme based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation that preserves the performance of the BNN even without the availability of aggregated real-valued auxiliary parameters that are usually needed during the training of the BNN. Moreover, for the first time in the literature, we theoretically derive the conditions under which the training of BNN is converging.  Numerical results show that the proposed FL framework significantly reduces the communication cost compared to the conventional neural networks with typical real-valued parameters, and the performance loss incurred by the binarization can be further compensated by a hybrid method.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables machine learning models to be trained in a distributed way<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In an FL setting, a federation of edge devices, such as Internet of Things devices, mobile phones, etc., trains a shared global model collaboratively under the coordination of a central server while keeping all the training data locally at the edges. This alleviates the growing privacy concern of sharing the data and reduces the communication cost caused by sending extensive data to a central node.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A typical federated learning system with a star network topology, illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Communication-Efficient Federated Learning with Binary Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, consists of a central server and many clients, where each client holds a local dataset to train a shared global model in a coordinated manner iteratively. At each training iteration, each client trains the model with its local dataset and then uploads the updated parameters to the server. The central server combines all the uploaded parameters from all the servers by algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FA)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which simply takes average of the received parameters from different clients, and then broadcasts the combined parameters to all the clients. A client will then update the local model with the received parameters, which completes one iteration of training.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Constantly updating the model parameters, which could be tens of millions for a deep neural network like ResNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, causes a massive communication overload. This could significantly slow down the convergence of FL as the communication links between the devices and the central server is usually with limited bandwidth and power<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Therefore, many research efforts have been made to theoretically characterize the fundamental trade-offs between the performance of the trained models and the communication costs of the FL framework<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Meanwhile, from a more practical point of view, other efforts have been made to reduce the total communication cost. Most of them focus on the uplink communication and attempt to either compress the parameters to be uploaded or reduce the frequency of uploading actions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Another direction of reducing the uplink communication overhead is to compress the gradient before sending to the server. Many algorithms have been proposed to this end, e.g., gradient sparsification<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, gradient quantization<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and sparse ternary compression<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Regarding the download communication, some existing methods also compressing the broadcast message from the server to the clients<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These works have remarkably eased the communication burden of the FL systems, however, at the cost of degrading the model performance. This has motivated researchers to consider the models inherently with low precision parameters for the sake of less communication cost to upload these parameters and preserve the model performance at the same time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The first attempt is made by J. Xu et al., who have proposed Federated Trained Ternary Quantization(FTTQ) in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, where ternary quantization is applied on all parameters of the model. Inspired by this work, we investigate the federated learning of the binary neural networks (BNN), a type of neural network with only binary parameters, in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">BNN was first proposed by I. Hubara et al. in 2016<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, where they show the BNN achieves nearly the same performance as the corresponding neural networks with real-valued parameters, which has brought a lot of research attention since. During the training of a BNN, a set of auxiliary real-valued parameters is used to keep the accumulation of gradients and update the binary parameters accordingly. A trivial way of training BNN in an FL setting is for each client to upload the auxiliary real-valued parameters to the server to aggregate and then feedback the aggregated parameters to the clients. However, this results in the exact communication cost of training a real-valued neural network, which is against the initial motivation of employing BNN. To reduce the communication cost, it is preferable to send only the binary parameters to the server, which may degrade the performance of the BNN as the auxiliary real-valued parameters may not be correctly updated at each iteration of training. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning algorithm of training the BNNs, referred to as <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BiFL-BiML</span>, that only uploads the binary parameters to the server, and employs a novel maximum likelihood-based parameter updating approach, referred to as <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ML-PU</span>, to estimate the aggregated auxiliary parameters with the local auxiliary parameters and the received aggregation of binary parameters from all the clients.

The training data is distributed among all the clients either in an IID or a non-IID manner. A typical federated learning algorithm operates iteratively with four phases, i.e., the <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local training</span> phase , the <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter uploading</span> phase, the <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter aggregating</span> phase and <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter downloading</span> phase.</p>

The <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter uploading</span> phase happens after the <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local training</span> phase when all the clients transmit the updated parameters to the central server. The communication cost occurring during this phase can be prohibitive as every client in the system needs to send a whole set of all parameters of the model to the server. After receiving all the local parameters from the clients, the server aggregates parameters in a certain way to generate one set of parameters of the model during the <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter aggregating</span> phase, which will then be broadcast to all the clients in the <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter downloading</span> phase. One widely used method to aggregate parameters is Federated Averaging (FA) algorithm<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which we use as a baseline to compare the novel parameter aggregating method proposed in this paper.

After the <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter downloading</span> phase, each client then initiates the model with the received parameters from the server and starts a new iteration of local training.</p>

The communication cost of the latter can be neglected as the transmission of the global parameters to all the clients can be done in a broadcast manner. Whereas in the <span id="S2.SS1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">parameter uploading</span> phase, each client has to unicast a different set of parameters to the server, which may introduce prohibitive communication costs. Hence in this paper, we focus on the minimization of the communication cost during this phase.</p>

The second dataset we use is the Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST) dataset<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, which is a well-known dataset for federated learning. The FEMNIST dataset is based on the Extended MNIST dataset, which is a more complicated  image classification problem.  The FEMNIST dataset is based on the Extended MNIST dataset, which is a more complicated image classification problem. More specifically, the dataset contains images of handwritten numbers and English alphabets, which has 62 classes in total. It is recommended to use only a part of it to validate FL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, since the dataset is very large, and the distributed algorithms will not be well examined if the learning ability of the clients is too high. In our experiments, we randomly select 10% of the Extended MNIST dataset for each experiment. For similar reason, we randomly select 50% of the CelebA dataset for each experiment. Reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> also provides code for partitioning the FEMNIST and CelebA dataset by both IID and non-IID manners, and for evaluating methods. We evaluate our algorithm following their work.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We can see that the centralized algorithms, i.e., the baseline and BNN, converges the fastest and results in the better accuracy than the federated learning algorithms as expected, however, there is a certain loss caused by binarization. We can also find a certain gap on the accuracy between all the distributed algorithms and corresponding centralized algorithms. It can be observed that the performance of our BiFL-BiML algorithm is  not too worse than the performance of FA and BiFL-Full and exceeds the other three distributed algorithms, i.e., BiFL-Bi-UpOnly, FTTQ, and BiFL-Bi-UpDown, while reducing the uploading communication cost from 32 bits to 1 bit. We notice that BiFL-BiML also converges faster than the other three communication effecient FL algorithms.  We note that BiFL-Bi-UpDown and FTTQ require smaller download communication cost, however, the difference is neglectable due to the broadcasting, especially when the number of clients is big. The better performance of the BiFL-BiML algorithm in terms of accuracy demonstrates the significance of updating the local model with high precision aggregated parameters. Since there is still a certain gap in accuracy between BiFL-BiML and FL, we can use a simple hybrid method to overcome this, which will be discussed later.</p>

This means that the data distribution of FEMNIST is not too far away from the IID data distribution, and that the BiFL-BiML is more sensible of partial participation mainly because the ML-PU is very sensible of the amount of the uploaded sets of parameters.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel federated learning algorithm, BiFL-BiML, to train neural networks with binary parameters. This algorithm introduces significant reduction in communication cost as the client uploads binary parameters instead of 32-bit float point parameters as in conventional federated learning systems. It employs a maximum likelihood estimation based parameter updating approach, ML-PU, in which each client estimates the auxiliary real-valued parameters based on the binary models’ aggregation result received from the server and then updates its local parameters. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to have theoretically derived the conditions on the convergence of training binary models by gradient descent algorithm. We numerically compared the proposed BiFL-BiML with the conventional FL algorithm, a communication-efficient FL algorithm for ternary neural works called FTTQ<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and two trivial implementations of FL learning with BNN, i.e., BiFL-Bi-UpOnly and BiFL-Bi-UpDown, respectively, which utilize simpler parameter updating mechanisms instead of ML-PU. The numerical results revealed that BiFL-BiML achieves performance close to the conventional FL algorithm while providing drastic reduction of communication cost, and significantly outperforms FTTQ, BiFL-Bi-UpOnly, and BiFL-Bi-UpDown under all the IID data, non-IID data, and unequal dataset size scenarios. The numerical results also revealed that the neural network can achieve nearly the same accuracy with a reduction of communication cost by a hybrid implementation of BiFL-BiML and the conventional FL algorithms.</p>
