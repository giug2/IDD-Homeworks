<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">As a promising learning paradigm integrating computation and communication, federated learning (FL) proceeds the local training and the periodic sharing from distributed clients. Due to the non-i.i.d. data distribution on clients, FL model suffers from the gradient diversity, poor performance, bad convergence, etc. In this work, we aim to tackle this key issue by adopting importance sampling (IS) for local training. We propose importance sampling federated learning (ISFL), an explicit framework with theoretical guarantees. Firstly, we derive the convergence theorem of ISFL to involve the effects of local importance sampling. Then, we formulate the problem of selecting optimal IS weights and obtain the theoretical solutions. We also employ a water-filling method to calculate the IS weights and develop the ISFL algorithms. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 fit the proposed theorems well and verify that ISFL reaps better performance, sampling efficiency, as well as explainability on non-i.i.d. data. To the best of our knowledge, ISFL is the first non-i.i.d. FL solution from the local sampling aspect which exhibits theoretical compatibility with neural network models. Furthermore, as a local sampling approach, ISFL can be easily migrated into other emerging FL frameworks.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a novel paradigm for distributed intelligent system, federated learning (FL) has received great attention in both research and application areas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The core idea of FL is to share the models of distributed clients, which train models using their local data. Basic federated learning systems consist of two stages: 1) Local training, where clients update their local models with local data; and 2) Central aggregation, where the parameter server aggregates the models uploaded from the clients and sends the global models back. Different from the traditional distributed learning methods that split the models or transmit the data, model parameters or gradients are designed to be the elements for client interaction in FL schemes. FL is recognized as a communication-efficient scheme for its full use of the client-center (client-client) communication, clients’ computation capability, and the distributed data sources<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The structures of FL naturally fit the distributed intelligent systems where computing is coupled with communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. On the one hand, FL can serve the hierarchical computing-communication systems such as edge computing or fog computing, where a cloud center and distributed devices/clusters participate. A number of applications emerge especially in the mobile scenarios such as artificial intelligence of Things (AIoT) and vehicular internet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The potentials of FL have been investigated in distributed inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, system optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and cooperative control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In particular, due to the efficient sharing mechanism of FL, its combinations with reinforcement learning (RL) or multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been considered, which is referred to as federated RL (FRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The corresponding frameworks have been designed for collaboration and scheduling of intelligent edge computing systems in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, distributed computing systems can also serve federated learning tasks. With the development of wireless communication, intelligent devices and the lightweight machine learning models, FL is envisioned as one of the core technologies in 6G systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. These mobile systems support the FL to be deployed in numerous emerging applications, such as VR/AR, smart city, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, FL has been evolving from many aspects and some learning schemes of traditional deep learning areas have also been migrated into FL. Furthermore, some theoretical studies on FL arise. For instance, Stich <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> derived the convergence of the local SGD for the first time, and Wang <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a><span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span> bounded the gradient norms under several FL settings. Considering the communication factors, the joint analysis and the guide for system design are further studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. These theoretical analysis guarantees the interpretability, robustness, generalization, privacy protection of FL and makes such learning schemes trustworthy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed learning systems suffer from the heterogeneity of both the clients and data. Particularly, as mentioned in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the heterogeneity of distributed data, also referred to as non-i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) data settings, is one of the most crucial issues in FL. In this work, we consider a commonly acknowledged perspective of FL non-i.i.d. setting, the data category distribution skew, which is typically represented in real world datasets. For example, the label distributions of clients’ training data make a difference on the global performance in classification tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Such non-i.i.d. data impacts FL from two aspects: Firstly, the data distributions highly differ for different clients, resulting in the divergence of local models; The second one is the imbalanced local data, which leads to bad generalization and the overfitting of the local models. Therefore, FL on non-i.i.d. data faces major challenges including slow convergence and unsatisfactory performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In conventional centralized deep learning, importance sampling (IS) is regarded as an effective method to mitigate the data imbalance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Both theoretical and experimental analysis has verified its improvement on accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, as well as training speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
In addition to investigating the importance sampling theoretically, these studies also provided new comprehensions of the optimal IS weights. For instance, iterative parameter estimation methods such as Monte Carlo based approaches can be adopted to estimate the weights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. By figuring out the factors that determines the optimal sampling, the sampling parameters can be further combined with the RL to automatically learn the adaptive sampling strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>

The popular solutions include data sharing, augmentation, model distillation, client selection, clustering, and sampling based methods. Here we mainly list the studies tightly related to ours.</p>

<div id="S1.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As for FL with sampling approach to tackle non-i.i.d. data, Tudor <span id="S1.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.SS3.p2.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a><span id="S1.SS3.p2.1.1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span> proposed a method to identify the data relevance at each client, based on which the data are sampled for local training before the learning tasks start. To extend the dynamic sampling strategies, Li <span id="S1.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.SS3.p2.1.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a><span id="S1.SS3.p2.1.2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span> measured each sample’s importance by its gradient norms during the training and designed the FL algorithms with client+sample selection. Such data-driven method requires calculating the instant gradient norm of each training sample, which means that the extra backward propagation shall be processed locally. Another systematic work on importance sampling FL was done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, where both data and client sampling are considered. The importance weights of the mini-batches were derived theoretically and the convergence of algorithms was also analyzed. However, the theoretical guarantees were carried based on the convex-function assumption which is not compatible with deep learning models such as neural networks. Besides, the experiments were tested on a simple regression problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Thus, the theoretical analysis of importance sampling based FL in deep learning tasks is still an open problem.</p>

Since FL conducts a parameter-level fusion, the local training significantly affects the global performance. Each client tends to update the model towards the local optimum which fits its own training data. Thus, one of the most crucial challenges for FL is the non-i.i.d. data distribution, which usually causes the local gradients and model parameters to diverge as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-A Federated Learning for Non-i.i.d.

Compared to centralized training on whole data, the deviation of the distributed clients hinders the global model from reaching the optimum solution using the whole data, which also leads to poor performance, as well as bad convergence.</p>

Numerous varieties of IS algorithms have been developed and their applications in machine learning area have also been exploited.

We shall assume that there exists certain data sampling strategies from which all clients collaborate to make the global model reach a better performance. Hence, we introduce importance sampling for local training on each client and formulate FL with importance sampling, abbreviated as ISFL. In traditional FL, the clients sample their local training data uniformly to carry out the backward-propagation (BP) with the mini-batch SGD based optimizer.

The theorems in the next section will demonstrate that the optimal IS weights are related to not only the above two distributions, but also the model parameters. Since the local models change as the training goes on, the IS weights shall be updated iteratively.

In general, ISFL up-samples the category with a large global proportion or a small gradient Lipschitz. The principle of the optimal local IS strategies can be explained as follows. Two kinds of data categories shall be used more frequently: 1) The categories with larger proportion possess more data samples, which helps the model learn more patterns and improves the local performance; 2) On the other hand, categories with small gradient Lipschitz will benefit the global model convergence at federated epochs. Therefore, in FL for non-i.i.d. data, instead of intuitively resampling the data according to the global distribution (up-sample the smaller proportion and down-sample the higher), we should also consider the offset term in (<a href="#A2.E31" title="In Proof of Theorem 2. ‣ B-A Proof of Theorem 2 ‣ Appendix B Proofs of The Optimal IS Strategies ‣ ISFL: Federated Learning for Non-i.i.d.

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The deployment of ISFL is flexible. The IS weight updating can be proceeded either centrally at parameter server or locally on each client. Note that the procedures consist of gradient Lipschitz updating and the IS weight calculation, where the former requires excessive computation. Therefore, we prefer to deploy the empirical gradient updating at the parameter server for better system efficiency. With the local data distribution uploaded, the optimal IS weights can be calculated at the server and sent back to each client. Particularly, if the local data distributions are considered to be the clients’ privacy, the IS weights shall be updated locally with the necessary factors transmitted instead.</p>

Thus, GradNorm-IS carries out a per-sample IS weight calculation, which requires more <math id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="|\mathcal{D}_{G}|" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">|</mo><msub id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒟</mi><mi id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">G</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">|</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"><abs id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2"></abs><apply id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">𝒟</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">𝐺</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1c">|\mathcal{D}_{G}|</annotation></semantics></math> times gradient computation locally on clients for each weight updating. RW-IS is an intuitive sampling strategy which re-weights the data and forces to sample the local training data uniformly.

One can observe that for the non-i.i.d. data, both FedAvg and GradNorm-IS perform poorly in terms of accuracy, convergence, and stability.

FL for regression models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, such scheme seems not well compatible with the neural network models which do not satisfy the convexity assumption of loss functions. Specifically, assigning higher weights to the data sample with larger gradient norm cannot effectively reduce the divergence of local SGD while employing the NN models. Such phenomena will be explained in detail through the sampling weight discussions later.

Though the categories with large gradient norms take over the most sampling proportion, the gradients of the updated model still remains. In other words, utilizing a data sample frequently in local training does not guarantee that its gradient on the updated model will reduce in future BP steps. Therefore, we tend to explain that sampling methods based on GradNorm might not be well compatible with the FL systems using deep learning models such as NNs.

Each client adopts its latest IS weights for the local training epochs. One can observe that the IS probabilities of different categories change dynamically. As shown, ISFL does not simply carry the re-weighting (RW-IS) to sample the data of each category uniformly. Some categories are always sampled with a large probability, while some are occasionally re-weighted to nearly 0 probability. Moreover, the experiments illustrate that some categories with large proportion will be down-sampled but still get a large IS probability than uniform sampling, e.g., Category 1 for Client 7. Meanwhile, some categories with small proportion will be highly up-sample such as Category 3 for Client 10.

The experimental results also meet the theoretical deductions based on which the optimal IS weights are derived. The core idea of ISFL strategies can be interpreted as: 1) to up-sample the categories with larger global proportion or 2) to down-sample the categories with larger empirical gradient Lipschitz. For above reasons, we consider ISFL as an effective FL scheme with theoretical guarantees for non-i.i.d. data.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the label-skewed non-i.i.d. data quagmire in federated learning and proposed a local importance sampling based framework, ISFL. We derived the theoretical guarantees of ISFL, as well as the solutions of the optimal IS weights using a water-filling approach. In particular, we improved the theoretical compatibility with the neural network models by relaxing the convexity assumptions. The ISFL algorithm was also developed and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental results demonstrated the improvement of ISFL for the non-i.i.d. data from several aspects. ISFL promotes the accuracy of basic FL and nearly reaches the performance of the centralized model using the integrated non-i.i.d. data. ISFL also shows its potentials on sampling efficiency and data robustness. This is significant for FL, especially for the mobile light-weight scenarios.</p>
