<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning struggles with their heavy
energy footprints on battery-powered devices. The learning
process keeps all devices awake while draining expensive battery power to train a shared model collaboratively,
yet it may still leak sensitive personal information.
Traditional energy management techniques in system kernel mode can force the training device entering low power states, but it may violate the SLO
of the collaborative learning.
To address the conflict between learning SLO and energy efficiency, we propose DEAL, an energy efficient learning system that saves
energy and preserves privacy with a decremental learning design. DEAL reduces the energy footprint from two layers: 1) an optimization layer
that selects a subset of workers with sufficient capacity and maximum rewards.
2) a specified decremental learning algorithm that actively
provides a decremental and incremental update functions, which allows kernel to correctly tune the
local DVFS.
We prototyped DEAL in containerized services with modern smartphone profiles
and evaluated it with several learning benchmarks with realistic traces.
We observed that DEAL achieves
75.6%–82.4% less energy footprint in different datasets, compared to the traditional methods.
All learning processes are faster than state-of-the-practice FL frameworks up to 2-4X in model convergence.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is a booming distributed learning technique, supporting large, data-intensive deep neural network models.
The FL framework serves when clients refuse to provide personal information while IT companies still want to profile models, collectively.
As such, the FL technique supports AI algorithms in many privacy-concerned applications, including Social Network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Smart Assistant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and Traffic Surveillance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, etc.
The common feature of these applications is that all smart devices involved only communicate with metadata, e.g., model gradients, to support one cloud to retrain a global model, with/without trust. In this way, the federated learning is claimed to mitigate the impact
of privacy leaking. Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, adapt FL in their learning framework, in order to conquer the privacy conscious data market with a $200 billion net worth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning supposes to support co-building models among multiple devices, while preserving privacy in-between.
Among these devices, each holds one replica of versioned model and its local data objects. Usually, one small set of
devices, called <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">servers</em>, are powerful that can publish a master model, and compute the alignment between all trained local models. Rest of the devices, called <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em>, subscribe models from <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">servers</em>, and repeat the training process in-sync, i.e., <em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federation</em>.
As such, raw data objects are not exchanged among parties, while the target model may converge after repeating the training process within a sufficient time.
In theory, the federated learning framework is anticipated to scale, working for millions to billions of devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, this simple FL framework can be expensive and possibly leaks privacy, for three major reasons. First,
federated learning implicitly assumes that the to-be trained model is simple enough that all synced <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em> can response
and <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">servers</em> can compute the alignment within a given time threshold. However, this collaborative learning behavior can reveal
the correlation between similar users, where this similarity model can be reused to reveal some private information.
Moreover, this model can be complex <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">per se</em>, leading to a possible consequence that the model fails to converge.
Second, <em id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em>
may spend a large amount of resources on model training,
which affect the response time and eventually the service-level objective (SLO). Authors of the original federated learning design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>
claimed some strong assumption that models are only trained while plug-in and with WiFi connection. But this claim prevents training data at a fine-grained granularity, violating
the purpose of adapting distributed learning, and ubiquity of mobile devices. In addition, the necessity of being realtime is a critical performance metric for today’s machine learning systems.
Letting device train local fresh data in realtime spends expensive battery energy.
When scaling-out, this expensive energy footprint
during the training process would grow exponentially, not to mention millions of devices involved, powered by batteries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Thus, a practical federated learning framework should intelligently adapt to privacy concerns with a consideration on the energy efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned challenges, it is required to analyze and further understand the nature
of federated learning. We first provide a study on understanding the state-of-the-practice FL frameworks on several applications. Based on our studies, there are two important observations: (1) For the model complexity and computational cost, in the history of model training, we could expect
the whole framework initiates a simple model with a naïve configuration. However, when scaling-out in FL, not all <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em> are active with
the same degree. As such, the FL framework may allow <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em> to forget some trained features at any time.
That is, models in each <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">worker</em> may differ in their versions, which is equivalent to the case that all devices are online but their
model versions are not all updated-to-date. This allows us to provide a tradeoff when publishing aligned models to <em id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em> at the beginning of each period. We may select a subset of <em id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em> without waking all device up, in order to reduce energy footprint while still
achieve a possible reward maximization. The optimization process can speed up the convergence while reducing the latency, thus local energy footprints.
(2) To further elaborate the concern on a privacy leak in a federated learning framework, we not only allow each <em id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">worker</em> to remove its old and sensitive data, but also allow
the model to delete the learnt sensitive features, or as we called this framework “forgets”. This technique is commonly seen as the <em id="S1.p4.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">decremental learning</em> in the community.
This feature works in orthogonal with the local energy management in the system kernel. Thus, we can treat it as a control signal to wake the energy management unit when the computation demand decreases, since the device forgets. In this way, all previous relentless effort on system energy management techniques, such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), process migration, and IC thermal shutdown, can be adopted into the federated learning process, in order to save training energy. These two observations and derived approaches are the key to provide an energy efficient federated learning system that forgets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above findings, we propose a <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">D</span>ecremental <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">E</span>nergy-<span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>ware <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning framework (DEAL) that provides an energy efficient design from decremental learning and energy saving techniques.
DEAL serves a two-layered design to reduce the overall energy footprint from the federated learning. When a federated job is created,
DEAL triggers an optimization process that models every candidate device into a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and solves it to maximize the objective revenue, i.e., training latency, data volume, and
energy footprint. In this way, the whole learning process can be conducted with a performance guarantee. When the learning
starts, DEAL develops a local middleware layer that carefully manages the local learning process as incremental and decremental updates, based on specific models. The middleware intelligently tunes
local energy state of mobile devices within the decremental learning process. When a bad decision is made in prediction or decremental update, DEAL can resolve the problem by recovering the model in the corresponding decremental and incremental updating algorithm.
We have prototyped DEAL in current mobile operating systems, supporting multiple learning frameworks.
The prototype is evaluated with machine learning models which are widely adopted in real-time machine learning systems, including Personalized PageRank and Tikhonov Regularization. The evaluation results show that DEAL can significantly reduce all learning completion time up to 2-4X, compared to the classic federated learning framework. In all state-of-the-practice baselines,
our design shows a 75.6%–82.4% less energy use in all workloads.</p>

Some user (e.g., user A) has touched the following items: <em id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">The Godfather, Titanic, Flipped, and Linear Algebra</em>. All the information could be potentially sensitive as all items are related to some personal privacy. Regulations, such as European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, give users the right to remove all these sensitive data. However,
the federated learning, can still reveal private user information from the database version after removing records from the user A.
For example, FL collects some click and transaction history from all users and computes a similarity matrix between pairs of users, which can be used for personal ranked item recommendation. The similarity distance in this scenario could be computed with a simple Jaccard similarity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Unfortunately, we can still guess this (already deleted) browsing history from the user A.

Digging into this information, we can check the undeleted browsing history from the user B/C to recover the deleted information for user A, on <em id="S2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">The Godfather</em>, <em id="S2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Flipped</em> and <em id="S2.p3.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Titanic</em>. Therefore, we conclude that it is still possible that these overlapping sets can reveal personal privacy through clustering, which can be considered as a level of privacy leak.</p>

In the federated training, there are two problems: the idle energy leakage and unnecessary memory footprint. We have already explained in Section <a href="#S1" title="I Introduction ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> that all <em id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em> in the FL framework are usually edge devices, powered by batteries. Previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> already reveals that a federated learning process consumes heavy energy footprint, shortening the overall device service time by 40%. Bonawitz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> argue that this is only a technical issue as the learning job is only processed when the device is recharging. However, this assumption violates two important features of the purpose of federated learning: (1) freshness of to-be-trained data objects; (2) the ubiquity of mobile devices. Moreover, that FL only happens when recharging prevents scaling out. Any unnecessary energy leak in a single device may affect all other <em id="S2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">workers</em>, leading to an exponential energy waste. In addition, the learning process needs to repeatedly retrieve all local data from the memory or secondary storage during training, which can cause a large number of page faults, and thus page switches with an extra delay. Thus, in order to have a locally efficiency design, we need to understand the energy footprint and memory use in the local training, and
an effective middleware that OS can use to elastically manage the data in memory and allow the learning algorithm coupling with the energy management policy.</p>

All selected workers are notified by the server via the PUB method, as well as receiving the models to be trained. Gradually, each worker finishes its local training, and sends back model gradients via SUB methods. In this process, workers can leave. DEAL allows the server to communicate with workers via the SUB method periodically, and starts the convergence process when receiving the majority signals from all selected workers or a Time To Live (TTL) is violated.</p>

With all aforementioned models, DEAL can provide a decremental learning version of local training based on the data and performance (i.e., energy and latency models). Note that, We need to do corresponding work for each type of specific model. Besides, DEAL may pick wrong devices due to bad prediction. DEAL can only fix the bad selection when another federated learning job initializes. Results show that this may only affect the 95%-percentile performance. On average, DEAL can sustain a better federated learning service, compared to other state-of-the practice. More discussion on fault tolerance can be found in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to solve the previously described privacy issues and heavy resource footprint, We propose to use a local decremental learning, which a respect the selected worker set with maximum rewards.
The main idea of our method is that the training algorithm of the target model retains the intermediate results in the process of model calculation. We can update the intermediate results effectively, mainly through two ways: incremental method to merge new user data, and decremental method to delete user data.
As such, we are able to fine tune the local energy configuration, as well as provide a more accurate profile of the local device for next round of global selection.</p>

DEAL keeps track of the level of forgetness in the decremental learning algorithms using data recovery policies, in order to prevent aggressive forgetting and the convergence failure. Next,
we present DEAL on two learning algorithm cases, namely Personalized PageRank and Tikhonov Regularization, which are widely used in the real-time mobile-based machine learning, in order to highlight the design and implementation of DEAL in the local layer, and show that DEAL can be easily adapted to effectively support other algorithms and systems.</p>

Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a fundamental opration first proposed by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The PPR algorithm is similar to the recommendation algorithm. They both calculate the distance between users from the perspective of user-item correlation. For example, in web page recommendation, the approach records the browsing history in each device. These pairs of co-occurring pages are ranked and formed the basis for recommendation later.
For the simplest form of PPR, its input includes a binary history matrix <math id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\textbf{Y}\in\left\{0,1\right\}^{|A|\times|I|}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4a"><mrow id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.cmml"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_bold" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.2a.cmml">Y</mtext><mo id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.1" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.cmml"><mrow id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.1.cmml"><mo id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.2.1" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.1.cmml">{</mo><mn id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.3.3" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.3.3.cmml">0</mn><mo id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.4" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.4.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.2.3" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><mrow id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml"><mrow id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.2.1" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.1.1.cmml">|</mo><mi id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">A</mi><mo rspace="0.055em" stretchy="false" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.2.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.1.1.cmml">|</mo></mrow><mo rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.3" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml">×</mo><mrow id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.2.1" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.1.1.cmml">|</mo><mi id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml">I</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.2.2" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.1.1.cmml">|</mo></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4b"><apply id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5"><in id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.1"></in><ci id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.2a.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.2"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_bold" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.2">Y</mtext></ci><apply id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3">superscript</csymbol><set id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.5.3.2.2"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.3.3">0</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4.4">1</cn></set><apply id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2"><times id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.3"></times><apply id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.2"><abs id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.4.2.1"></abs><ci id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.1">𝐴</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.2"><abs id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.5.2.1"></abs><ci id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.2.2.2.2">𝐼</ci></apply></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p3.1.m1.4c">\textbf{Y}\in\left\{0,1\right\}^{|A|\times|I|}</annotation></semantics></math>, which represents the interactions between a set of devices <math id="S3.SS4.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">A</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝐴</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p3.2.m2.1c">A</annotation></semantics></math> and a set of items <math id="S3.SS4.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="I" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p3.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">I</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p3.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p3.3.m3.1.1">𝐼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p3.3.m3.1c">I</annotation></semantics></math>.

Although DEAL uses the similarity matrix to find corresponding users, it may selectively reduce the data. As the training proceeds, the new data overwrite the old data. Moreover, the new data could be detected after a few training rounds. The detailed analysis is discussed in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Comparision of Training Completion Time.</span>
We first train a model on each dataset and load it into the smartphone. Next, we compare the overall training completion time of DEAL with all baselines in different application scenarios, and repeat every experiment for twenty randomly selected users. Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the experimental results under different CPU frequencies on Huawei Honor 8 Lite.
Specifically, Figure <a href="#S4.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a> shows the results of training time of Personalized PageRank model on the movielens and jester datasets.
In the movielens datasets, DEAL achieves one and two orders of magnitude faster than the NewFL and Original, respectively.
It is because only DEAL trains less data than the Original, but also DEAL forgets some updates during training, thus greatly reducing the overall training time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly, Figure <a href="#S4.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a> shows the results of training time of a non-linear model, a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm with Locality Sensitive Hashing, on the mushrooms and phishing datasets.
DEAL has the similar improvement on the training time, namely one order of magnitude and three orders of magnitude faster than the NewFL and the Original, respectively.
Moreover, when we allow aggressive DVFS on the device,
DEAL can achieve four orders of magnitude better performance than the Original, in the phishing dataset. It is because
(1) the phishing dataset is very large and the whole training is more I/O intensive than other workloads, allowing more power saving potentials; (2) The Original always trains the whole data set, which has a much larger memory footprint than DEAL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the rest two cases, Figure <a href="#S4.F3.sf3" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(c)</span></a> and <a href="#S4.F3.sf4" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(d)</span></a>, both illustrate that the advantage of DEAL, compared to the two baselines, can achieve 2-4 orders of magnitude faster in training a converged model. However, when the data more coarse-grained distributed such as the YearPredictionMSD dataset,
the performance of DEAL slowly converges to that of the NewFL.
Yet, DEAL always achieves a better modeling performance than the NewFL because DEAL captures feature from older data objects.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Comparision of Convergence Time.</span>
We deploy hundreds of FL docker images to simulate corresponding mobile devices. Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the simulation results. The CDF result of Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the trend of the convergence time of DEAL and Original on Personalized PageRank model with the default power governor (interactive).
Concretely, as can be seen from Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, in the Movielens dataset, 92% of the simulated devices show that the advantage of DEAL is faster in training the converged model compared with the Original, and the median values of convergence time for DEAL and the Original are 158ms and 94,988ms (normalized to 0.18 and 0.55). In the Jester dataset, 85% of the simulated devices show that the advantage of DEAL is faster in training the converged model compared with the Original, and the median value of the convergence time for DEAL and the Original are 1ms and 6,598ms (normalized to 0.25 and 0.36). This shows that in our simulation, the convergence time of DEAL of more than half of the mobile devices is three orders of magnitude faster than that of the Original.
This is because DEAL allows the server to communicate with workers via the SUB method periodically, and start the central convergence when receiving more than half SUB signals from all selected workers or passed a TTL. DEAL does not need to wait for all models update. However, it can be seen that the effect of the Tail of the convergence time is not good enough.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Comparison of Model Accuracy.</span>
Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> compares the accuracy of the Tikhonov regularization model on different datasets. It shows that in the phishing dataset, the model accuracy of DEAL is only 9% lower than that of the Original. Among these datasets, the housing dataset has the largest accuracy reduction, which is reduced by 12%. The accuracy of the remaining datasets is not much different from the Original, which are all about 3%.
The results show that, while guaranteeing the accuracy of the model, DEAL effectively improves the learning speed for on-device federated learning, and it can be seen from the subsequent results that DEAL also improves the energy efficiency of federated learning on the devices.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Comparison of Energy Consumption.</span>
Rather than having a less training time, DEAL allows adaptive power control in the training algorithm, as aforementioned in Section <a href="#S3" title="III Design and Implementation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. Here, we provide an energy consumption analysis based on our measured data under different CPU frequencies on the Huawei Honor 8 Lite in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
One common theme behind the power saving is, no matter which baselines, the total energy consumed gradually decreases with the CPU frequency.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf1" title="In Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(a)</span></a> shows the results of the consumed energy for training of Personalized PageRank model on the movielens and jester datasets. It can be seen that DEAL of the movielens dataset saves 253.2uAh of energy and 3687.1uAh of energy, as compared to the NewFL and the original, respectively. DEAL can save about 300uAh in the jester dataset. Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a> shows the results of the consumed energy for training of k-Nearest Neighbors with Locality Sensitive Hashing on the mushrooms and phishing datasets. It can be seen that DEAL of the mushrooms and phishing datasets consume an order of magnitude less energy than the NewFL, saving about 250uAh of energy. Compared to the Original, DEAL achieves energy saving in the amount of approximately 110,000uAh. Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf3" title="In Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(c)</span></a> shows the results of the consumed energy for training Multinomial Naïve Bayes models on mushrooms, phishing, and covtype datasets. DEAL of these three datasets consumes two to three orders of magnitude less energy than the NewFL, saving about 263uAh of energy. DEAL of the mushrooms and phishing datasets consumes three orders of magnitude less energy than the Original. In the the covtype dataset, DEAL consumes 4 orders of magnitude less energy than the Original. Because the cardinality of the covtype dataset is much larger than the mushrooms and phishing datasets, the training time and power consumption required for a whole retraining increase accordingly. Specifically, DEAL of the covtype datasets saves 17,908.1uAh of energy compared to the Original. Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf4" title="In Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(d)</span></a> shows the results of the consumed energy for training of Tikhonov regularization model on the housing, cadata, and YearPredictionMSD datasets. DEAL of the housing dataset saves only 6.7uAh of energy compared to the Original. This is because the housing dataset size is too small, so it consumes less energy for retraining. DEAL of the YearPredictionMSD dataset saves 77,497.6uAh of energy compared to the Original.</p>

There is currently no existing approach that can effectively quantify privacy on mobile phones  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, so we measure privacy by observing the proportion of data objects. We add 10 new data objects in each round of training and observe the proportion of these 10 new data objects to the overall training data objects to measure the privacy situation.
It can be seen from Figure <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-B Results ‣ IV evaluation ‣ DEAL: Decremental Energy-Aware Learning in a Federated System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> that for NewFL, its effect is the best, it only trains new data, so its proportion is always 100%. For Original, because it needs to train all the data (10 newly added data and the previous old data), as the number of training increases, its proportion value continues to decrease. For DEAL, there is a phenomenon of jitter, because DEAL includes two learning methods: decremental learning and incremental learning.
In real life, we generally delete old data, so DEAL pays less and less attention to old data. In addition, new data always overwrites old data. But when we need to delete new data, DEAL can also delete these data in a specific training round.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes an energy efficient learning framework, DEAL, that achieves energy saving with a decremental learning design. DEAL improves the energy efficiency of the training process from two main levels. The first level selects a subset of workers with sufficient capacity in order to maximize the rewards, i.e., energy saving potentials.
The second level is made up of a specified decremental learning algorithm that actively provides a decremental and incremental update functions, which adaptively tunes the DVFS of local mobile device. DEAL is prototyped in containerized services with modern smartphone profiles and evaluated with different learning benchmarks with real-world traces.
The evaluation result shows that DEAL achieves 75.6%–82.4% less energy footprint in different datasets, compared to the traditional methods. Moreover, all learning processes are faster than the classic federated learning framework up to 2-4 orders of magnitude. Immediate future work includes evaluating DEAL with
more applications and models on more smartphones at scaling-out.</p>
