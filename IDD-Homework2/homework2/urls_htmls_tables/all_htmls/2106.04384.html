<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Acquiring a sufficient amount of training data is a significant bottleneck for machine learning (ML) based data analytics.
Recently, commoditizing ML models has been proposed as an economical and moderate solution to ML-oriented data acquisition.
However, existing model marketplaces assume that the broker can access data owners’ private training data, which may not be realistic in practice.
In this paper, to promote trustworthy data acquisition for ML tasks, we propose FL-Market, a <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">locally</span> private model marketplace that protects privacy against not only model buyers but also an untrusted broker.
FL-Market decouples ML from the need to centrally gather training data on the broker’s side using <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning</span>, a privacy-preserving ML paradigm in which data owners collaboratively train an ML model by uploading local gradients (to be aggregated into a global gradient for model updating).
Then, FL-Market enables data owners to locally perturb their gradients by <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local differential privacy</span> and thus further prevents privacy risks.
To drive FL-Market, we propose a deep learning-empowered auction mechanism for intelligently deciding the local gradients’ perturbation levels and an optimal aggregation mechanism for aggregating the perturbed gradients.
Our auction and aggregation mechanisms can jointly maximize the global gradient’s accuracy, which optimizes model buyers’ utility.
Our experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) based data analytics has demonstrated great success in many domains.
Acquiring a sufficient amount of private data to train ML models usually needs considerable expenses, especially as data owners are becoming increasingly aware of the value of their data and the severe risks from uncontrolled data usage after sharing the data.
Consequently, recent efforts have proposed <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model marketplaces</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> where a data broker commercializes data owners’ private data in the form of ML models to facilitate ML-oriented data acquisition.
Since model buyers do not contact training data directly, this category of business models can relieve data owners’ concerns about losing control over their data and thus incentivize data sharing to some extent.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, data owners still face notable privacy risks in the existing model marketplaces, which may make them hesitate to contribute data.
Although some works (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>) reduce privacy leakage to model buyers by injecting random noise into ML models using central differential privacy (CDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, existing works assume that the broker is trusted and authorized to access and control the raw data.
This assumption is unrealistic, considering that many giant companies have been involved in user data breaches or privacy scandals.
Therefore, we demand a model marketplace that protects privacy against not only model buyers but also its broker.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated learning</span> (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving ML.
Unlike traditional ML that requires training data to be stored on a centralized server (e.g., a broker in a model marketplace), FL enables the clients (i.e., data owners) to collaboratively train a model by uploading local updates (e.g., gradients) and, meanwhile, to keep their own training data on the local sides.
Since FL decouples ML from the need to centrally gather training data, it can largely restrict an untrusted server’s ability to acquire private information.
Even though the local gradients trained on the raw data can be sensitive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, many works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> suggest that <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local differential privacy</span> (LDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> can be combined with FL to perturb the gradients on the local sides and thus protect privacy.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, for the first time, we propose a locally private model marketplace empowered by FL and LDP, called <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FL-Market</span> (Federated Learning Based Locally Private Model Market), to promote trustworthy data acquisition for ML-based data analytics.
Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FL-Market: Trading Private Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> depicts the three parties in FL-Market: data owners, model buyers, and an FL broker.
The FL broker coordinates FL-based model training and trading between data owners and model buyers.
A model buyer attempts to purchase ML models with a financial budget.
Data owners do not sell their raw data; instead, they sell locally private gradients perturbed by LDP in the training process coordinated by the FL broker.
The perturbation level is controlled by a privacy parameter <math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math>, which LDP formally defines as a metric of privacy loss.
To incentivize contribution, we follow seminal differentially private data marketplaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to employ an auction-based method for pricing gradients.
Concretely, we allow each owner to report (bid) her valuation of privacy loss, named <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">privacy valuation</span>, and report the maximum tolerable privacy loss, called <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">privacy budget</span>.
Then, the broker uses an <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">auction mechanism</span> to decide each owner’s privacy parameter and compensate for the corresponding privacy loss according to her privacy valuation.
The auction should guarantee <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">truthfulness</span>, which means each data owner (i.e., a bidder) will never obtain a higher utility by reporting an untruthful privacy valuation and budget.
Finally, the perturbed local gradients are aggregated into a global gradient by an <span id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aggregation mechanism</span> to update the buyer’s model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Building this model marketplace calls for an elaborate mechanism design that enables the auction and aggregation mechanisms to jointly optimize the global gradient’s utility.
First, in FL-Market, the broker has to aggregate the locally private gradients considering their various accuracy levels.
Consequently, the aggregation mechanism should factor in the privacy losses decided by the auction mechanism when making a decision.
Second, the auction mechanism should properly purchase local gradients to maximize the aggregated gradient’s utility, which implies that the aggregation decision feeds back into the auction decision.
However, the aggregation mechanism may fail to provide an analytical solution.
In this case, the utility-maximizing objective of our auction problem also cannot be expressed in an analytic form, which makes it extremely challenging to characterize and design an optimal truthful mechanism.
In a nutshell, the need for joint optimization dramatically increases the complexity of optimal mechanism design.

In FL-Market, data owners maintain control of their raw data by FL and enjoy the desired level of privacy against both the broker and model buyers using LDP.
To the best of our knowledge, FL-Market is the first <span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">locally</span> private model marketplace.

The conventional practice of FL aggregates gradients with weights proportional to clients’ data sizes (i.e., all samples are uniformly weighted), which may not be optimal when the gradients are perturbed to different extents.
We transform the problem of designing an optimal aggregation mechanism under personalized privacy losses into an equivalent <span id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">quadratic programming problem</span>.
We prove that the equivalent problem is convex and thus can be solved by off-the-shelf optimizers.
Supported by the optimizers, OptAggr decides the optimal way to aggregate the gradients.

Concretely, to design an optimal mechanism that jointly optimizes the gradient’s utility with the aggregation mechanism, we seek support from RegretNet, the state-of-the-art deep learning-empowered automated mechanism design technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
However, RegretNet always generates <span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">randomized</span> allocation results for auction items (i.e., the privacy losses in our case), which makes it tough to maximize the global gradient’s accuracy.
On the contrary, DM-RegretNet (Deterministic Multi-Unit RegretNet) yields <span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">deterministic</span> auction decisions jointly with OptAggr and thus can significantly improve the global gradient’s utility.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that DM-RegretNet can achieve better model accuracy and approximate the truthfulness constraint more closely than RegretNet.</p>

To the best of our knowledge, such a problem has yet to be generally solved in the literature.
Moreover, we have to involve the aggregation mechanism in minimizing the global gradient’s error bound, which increases the complexity of optimal mechanism design.
Concretely, the privacy losses affect the aggregation weights in Problem <a href="#Thmproblem1" title="Problem 1 (Error Bound-Minimizing Aggregation). ‣ Aggregation mechanism ‣ III-C Mechanism Design ‣ III FL-Market Framework ‣ FL-Market: Trading Private Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, but the latter also feeds back into the former in Problem <a href="#Thmproblem2" title="Problem 2 (Budget-Limited Multi-Unit Multi-Item Procurement Auction). ‣ Auction mechanism ‣ III-C Mechanism Design ‣ III FL-Market Framework ‣ FL-Market: Trading Private Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, which calls for joint optimization.
By solving this problem, we can obtain an auction mechanism that maximizes the global gradient’s utility jointly with <span id="S3.SS3.SSSx2.p3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Aggr</span>.</p>

Note that there is no existing analytical solution to Problem <a href="#Thmproblem3" title="Problem 3 (Equivalent problem of Problem 1). ‣ Problem transformation ‣ IV Aggregation Mechanism: OptAggr ‣ FL-Market: Trading Private Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> to the best of our knowledge.
Hence, we propose the OptAggr mechanism that (1) allocates zero-valued aggregation weights to those data owners with zero-valued privacy losses and (2) then computes other data owners’ aggregation weights by solving Problem <a href="#Thmproblem3" title="Problem 3 (Equivalent problem of Problem 1). ‣ Problem transformation ‣ IV Aggregation Mechanism: OptAggr ‣ FL-Market: Trading Private Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> with a polynomial-time optimizer, as depicted in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ Problem transformation ‣ IV Aggregation Mechanism: OptAggr ‣ FL-Market: Trading Private Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we design a truthful mechanism that maximizes the global gradient’s utility jointly with the OptAggr mechanism.
Since OptAggr does not provide an analytical solution to Problem <a href="#Thmproblem3" title="Problem 3 (Equivalent problem of Problem 1). ‣ Problem transformation ‣ IV Aggregation Mechanism: OptAggr ‣ FL-Market: Trading Private Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the objective function also cannot be expressed in an analytic form, which makes it extremely difficult to characterize and design an optimal truthful mechanism.
To design a truthful mechanism that optimizes the nonanalytical objective, we turn to an automated mechanism design approach that achieves an auction objective by ML.
We also propose a traditional auction mechanism in Appendix <a href="#A2" title="Appendix B All-in: Single-Minded Auction Mechanism ‣ FL-Market: Trading Private Models in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a>.</p>

Second, some extra variance from the randomness of the allocation results by RegretNet might be introduced into the perturbed local gradients.
Third, also because of the allocation randomness, RegretNet cannot treat the (expected) error bound minimization function as the objective function for model training.

The empirical regrets and IR violations under DM-RegretNet are significantly lower than those under RegretNet and M-RegretNet, which means that DM-RegretNet has stronger abilities to approximate the truthfulness and IR constraints.
DM-RegretNet has this advantage because it is a deterministic mechanism that universally guarantees truthfulness and IR, while RegretNet and M-RegretNet are randomized mechanisms that approximate the two constraints by expectation.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Incentive mechanisms for FL</h4>

<div id="S7.SS0.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> have been proposed to encourage participation in FL by providing appropriate rewards for data owners’ contributions.
The contributions can be evaluated in various ways.
For example, Zhan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> consider the data size, the most basic measurement of data, for contribution evaluation.
Then, from a cost-covering perspective, Jiao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> propose an auction mechanism where data owners can bid their computational and communication costs in providing their FL training services.
Similarly, Sarikayar et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> regard the CPU computational costs as their contributions.
Then, Richardson et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> evaluate data owners’ influences on the model accuracy to decide their rewards.
The Shapley value is also adapted into an FL version by Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> to value data owners’ influence.
Data quality is another natural choice.
Since the data quality is known only to data owners, to ensure the contribution of high-quality data, Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> design different types of rewarding contracts to distinguish data owners such that the FL server can infer the data quality based on the contracts they select.
In this way, the rewards are essentially determined by the data quality.
In addition, both the works of Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> employ some reputation metric to remove unreliable data owners from FL.
However, none of the above mechanisms considers privacy protection, which is also a critical incentive.
To fill this gap, we propose an auction-based incentive mechanism that protects data owners’ privacy and compensates them according to their privacy preferences.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">FL under LDP</h4>

<div id="S7.SS0.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Some efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> have devoted to designing FL frameworks under LDP.
Since the data perturbation under LDP may substantially reduce the utility of FL models, these authors mainly focus on how to reduce the perturbation level while still providing appropriate privacy guarantees.
Concretely, to relieve the utility problem that the noise that LDP injects into a gradient should be proportional to its size, Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> propose an FL framework to perturb only the top-k important dimensions of the gradient and thus can its utility.
Then, Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and Girgis et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> employ the shuffle model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> in their FL frameworks to amplify the privacy guarantee under the same level of noise injection.
Then, Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> propose a more secure LDP mechanism that can extend the difference between the perturbed data and its original value while introducing lower variance.
There are also works on designing LDP-based FL frameworks for specific ML tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
While prior works address the utility problem under LDP by relaxing the privacy guarantee or elaborately injecting noise, we tackle it from an incentive perspective, i.e., by incentivizing data owners to contribute more privacy loss, which can also increase utility.
In addition, Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> propose an LDP-based FedSGD algorithm, which is similar to our protocol in privacy protection; however, they assume uniform privacy losses for all data owners and thus do not consider different perturbation levels when aggregating gradients.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FL-Market to facilitate trustworthy data acquisition for ML-based data analytics.
Our mechanisms can incentivize data sharing by providing preferred levels of local privacy and compensation for data owners and optimizing model buyers’ utility.
FL-Market opens up new possibilities for ML-oriented data acquisition and initiates a new direction toward designing locally private model marketplaces.
There are several interesting future directions.
One question is how to guarantee that the auction decisions are arbitrage free against strategic buyers.
Another question is how to apply and optimize FL-Market in specific learning tasks.</p>

<p id="A2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To meet the demands of single-minded bidders, we can design a truthful mechanism using Myerson’s characterization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, which indicates that the <span id="A2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">monotonicity</span> and <span id="A2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">critical payment</span> properties imply truthfulness.
Concretely, monotonicity requires that a winner should still win if she re-reports a higher privacy budget, a larger data size, and/or a lower valuation with other bidders’ bids fixed;
the critical payment property ensures that winners are paid the maximum possible payments (i.e., critical payments) and hence that they have no incentive to misreport bids.
However, the limited financial budget makes the problem more difficult because the winner selection should depend on the payments, which in turn depend on the selection results.
Hence, we should carefully identify budget-feasible critical payments.</p>
