<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Countries across the globe have been pushing strict regulations on the protection of personal or private data collected. The traditional centralized machine learning method, where data is collected from end-users or IoT devices, so that it can discover insights behind real-world data, may not be feasible for many data-driven industry applications in light of such regulations. A new machine learning method, coined by Google as Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple participants to train a machine learning model collectively without directly exchanging data. However, recent studies have shown that there is still a possibility to exploit the shared models to extract personal or confidential data. In this paper, we propose to adopt Multi- Party Computation (MPC) to achieve privacy-preserving model aggregation for FL. The MPC-enabled model aggregation in a peer-to-peer manner incurs high communication overhead with low scalability. To address this problem, the authors proposed to develop a two-phase mechanism by 1) electing a small committee and 2) providing MPC-enabled model aggregation service to a larger number of participants through the committee. The MPC- enabled FL framework has been integrated in an IoT platform for smart manufacturing. It enables a set of companies to train high quality models collectively by leveraging their complementary data-sets on their own premises, without compromising privacy, model accuracy vis-a‘-vis traditional machine learning methods and execution efficiency in terms of communication cost and execution time.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The astounding growth of data being collected and analyzed has led to rapid advances in data-driven technologies and applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Every data collected is valuable as it contains insights towards various application domains. With privacy laws being enforced by many countries globally over data collection of sensitive or personal data, this has a repercussion on how and what data is being collected. The traditional way of just collecting data and processing it may no longer apply. If systems were to collect just non-sensitive or non personal data, many important insights will be missed. Even if there is consent to collect sensitive or personal data, , data sharing without authorization would result in threats of data breaches  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Data collected could likewise be mishandled, thereby violating the fundamental rights to privacy for both individuals and companies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
The invention of advanced technologies to handle sensitive and personal information to maximise its value has become one of the biggest science growth for data analytics community in recent years. An interesting aspect that makes this growth
even more important is that there are many scenarios that require the combination of obtaining sensitive information from several sources towards very useful insights. For example, hospitals, medical researchers and drug companies can benefit from jointly measuring the incidence of an illness without revealing private patient data; banks and financial regulators can assess systemic risk without revealing their private portfolios.However, in practice, data sharing across collaborators has various limitations including data ownership, legal compliance, and technical constraint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. As a result, massive volume of data collected today remains in the form of fragmented data islands at individual organizations.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, introduced by Google’s AI research team, supports decentralized collaborative machine learning over a number of devices or companies. The training data stays on each client device and only the locally trained model parameters are transferred to a central coordinator, which aggregate these models into a global federated model as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Two-Phase Multi-Party Computation Enabled Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The federated model is then sent back to the clients for training and improving the model iteratively. Google claimed that privacy is protected by keeping raw data on client devices and company’s on-premise IT infrastructure. In addition, federated learning could also make use of participants’ computation resources for training the time-consuming model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although the FL technique appears to ensure data remain on-premise, scientists have investigated that data (sensitive or otherwise) can still be extracted out from the FL technique  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. They have published methods to show that the machine learning model parameters can be reverse engineered to extract the data sets that are residing with the devices or in the company’s IT infrastructure  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Generally, it is concluded that in order to ensure the confidentiality of all the information and prevent the indirect data leakage, the model’s parameters need to be securely encrypted  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> against any possibility of reverse engineering and third party attacks against federated learning model training. For this reason, privacy-preserving techniques, such as secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, Homomorphic Encryption (HE)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and Differential Privacy (DP)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>are typical technology candidates to work together with FL for preserving the data confidentiality of model aggregation  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Google apparently recognized this flaw and subsequently proposed a practical MPC-based secure aggregation for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> ; SecureBoost  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> which is implemented as a vertical tree-based FL system using homomorphic encryption to protect the gradients; and OpenMind  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> combined MPC and DP functionalities in its FL framework.
Secure MPC is a class of cryptography techniques that allow a number of parties to compute a joint function over their sensitive data sets. Only the output of the joint function is disclosed without revealing participants’ private inputs. Secure MPC performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> has been improved significantly, due to the fast development of MPC protocols, software implementations, and underlying computation infrastructure. Today, secure MPC has known to be thousands of times faster than fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) implementation in typical applications. Another method to ensure data security and confidentiality is Differential Privacy (DP). DP protects data privacy by adding random noise in the computation by a third party but it is not suitable for federated learning as the noise may affect the accuracy of federated learning model. For above reasons, this paper chooses MPC to support privacy-preserving (or data security and confidentiality of) model aggregation for federated learning.
However, there is a downside if one were to employ MPC to preserve the data confidentiality of FL. In general, MPC protocols require all parties to generate and exchange secret shares of private data to all other parties. This basic needs inevitably results in high communication overhead and this overhead exponentially increases with the number of parties in the membership list agreeing to work together, regardless if they are trusted or non trusted parties. This leads to the motivation of this paper and the technique the authors are publishing. To reduce the communication cost and improve scalability, this paper proposes a two-phase MPC-enabled FL framework. What it means is that instead of a condition that every member is required to generate and exchange secret shares of data across all members list, it proceed to elect a subset of FL members as the model aggregation committee members out of the whole membership list. The elected committee membersand then uses MPC service to aggregate the local models of all FL parties. The 2-phase MPC introduces a hierarchical structure, where there is a need for fewer secret shares being exchanged for privacy-preserving (or data confidentiality) model aggregation. The technique becomes more pronounced when the membership lists is large, and the number of committee members is only a fraction of the number of FL parties.
Both Peer-to-Peer and Two-Phase MPC-enabled FL frame- work are implemented on PyTorch, a Facebook-based distributed machine learning and deep learning platforms. A parallel mechanism is developed to enable MPC-based model aggregation on the entire model tensors with large amounts of parameters. The FL framework is further integrated with our in-house Industrial IoT (IIoT) platform which could be deployed on-premise or on public Cloud. A smart manufacturing use case with real-world sensor data sets and machine failure labels is used in our experiments, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FL framework in terms of model accuracy and execution efficiency.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is too broad a subject. Thus, FL can be further categorized into horizontal FL and vertical FL. In horizontal FL, all participating parties (e.g. regional hospitals or manufacturing companies using the same type of machine)have the entire feature set and labels available to train their local model. The computed local gradients from different participants are being sent (to where is it being sent?) to the server/aggregator to train a global model. In vertical FL, all participating parties (e.g. banks, insurance and e-commerce companies within the same city) collect data with different feature spaces and only one party has access to the label. Parties (without label) are unable to train a model on their own, due to the lack of information. As a result of this, additional layer of complexity is added to securely align the sample spaces and the training process requires exchanging partial model updates. In this paper, the authors focus on horizontal FL only.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, only a few production-grade alternatives that challenge the centralized machine learning paradigm are available. Google has started to work towards Federated Learning called Tensor flow Federated (TFF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> in Mar 2019. CrypTen  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> is a MPC-based privacy preserving machine learning framework built on PyTorch by Facebook. OpenMined  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, an open-source community focused on building technology that combines Deep Learning, Federated Learning, Homomorphic Encryption and Blockchain over decentralized data. FATE (Federated AI Technology Enabler) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> is another open-source project initiated by WeBank’s AI Group to provide a secure computing framework for building the federated AI ecosystem. ByteLake <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, an AI consultancy based in Poland, recently released a proof of concept for the manufacturing industry in concert with Lenovo for predictive maintenance. Different from existing general FL frameworks, our federated learning framework supports privacy-preserving, value oriented federated learning over decentralized data that is integrated into IIoT platform with visualization and smart manufacturing domain knowledge.
Although MPC has been widely applied for privacy-preserving FL, limited work has been published to enhance performance and scalability of MPC-enable FL frameworks. OpenMined <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> provides a very basic evaluation of MPC overhead for model aggregation. Google provides complexity analysis and communication overhead evaluation on its practical MPC protocols for FL. In contrast, this paper proposes a hierarchical and parallel MPC operations for efficient model aggregation.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, secret sharing based MPC protocols have been more commonly used in production systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. A typical secret share MPC protocol is shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A Multi-Party Computation ‣ III MPC-enabled Federated Learning Framework ‣ Two-Phase Multi-Party Computation Enabled Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> , each sensitive data is split into “secret shares”, which in combination yield the original data. They interact with each other to compute confidential function by exchanging secret shares according to MPC protocols. As long as majority of parties honestly follow the protocol, no party learns anything beyond the final output of the computation. Since each computing party works on one piece of secret share, only if a threshold number of computing parities are compromised, the attacker could reconstruct private data from secret shares. Consequently, MPC can be viewed as a cryptography method for providing the functionality of a trusted party—who would accept private inputs, compute a function and return the result to the stakeholders—without the need for mutual trust among participants.
Both Additive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and Shamir <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> secret sharing MPC protocols are used for privacy-preserving model aggregations in FL framework. For simplicity consideration, this study focus on Neural Network (NN) machine learning models only and the model aggregation calculates the averaged weights among local NN models trained by all parties. Since the number of FL parties are pre-known, only addition MPC operation is needed.</p>

As illustrated in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Multi-Party Computation ‣ III MPC-enabled Federated Learning Framework ‣ Two-Phase Multi-Party Computation Enabled Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>, MPC introduces overhead on both computation and communication. Hence, the performance enhancement is essential to make privacy-preserving FL practicable. The machine learning models become more and more complex to solve large-scale and complex problems. Sequential MPC operations on individual parameters/weights of the model would introduce tremendous overhead. The efficiency of parallel MPC operations has been verified in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, as the computation and commutation cost could be reduced significantly by doing so in bulks.
Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-B Peer-to-Peer MPC-enabled Federated Learning ‣ III MPC-enabled Federated Learning Framework ‣ Two-Phase Multi-Party Computation Enabled Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the procedure of model aggregation by calculating the average value of the tensors. The tensors of individual local models are privacy-sensitive. They are split into multiple tensors as the secret shares by adding randomness. After exchanging secret shares, each participant holds one share of each tensor. Consequently, participants conduct a local aggregation of the secret shares, followed by a global aggregation to cancel out the randomness and thus get the average value of the tensors (i.e., local models) of all participants. In this way, participants get federated model for the global training epoch, while keeping their data and local models in private.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancement in IoT and AI have push fast transformation in smart manufacturing. Industrial IoT (IIoT) platforms like Azure, AWS, ThingWorx and MindSphere support and orchestrate data collection, storage, processing and visualization on edge, on-premise and Cloud. Predictive maintenance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> has become a very strong use case for manufacturers advancing to Industry 4.0. It offers an effective solution for detecting faults (diagnosis) and predictions of the future working conditions and the remaining useful life (prognosis), using the data captured from IoT devices (e.g., vibration, force, acoustic and emission sensors). This helps to avoid system interruptions and thereby minimizing the downtime and cost.
In order to provide high quality predictive maintenance service, the equipment vendor requires customers to share data, including equipment operation conditions, sensor data and failure incidences. By aggregating the data sets from a number of customers, the vendor could train and update the predictive maintenance which taking different operation scenarios into considerations. However, this centralized training mechanism faces lots of challenges e.g., data ownership, data privacy, latency and cost.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate the proposed federated learning framework, this paper studied a use case of fault detection in electrical machines which are widely adopted in smart manufacturing. Effective diagnosis of motor faults is essential to enhance reliability of manufacturing process as well as to reduce the cost of operation and maintenance. This study used the real world sensor data (e.g., vibration, temperature, currency and acoustic) and machine healthy and faulty label from a number of induction motors. The data sets were collected in the University of Tennessee USA, by Prof. J. Wesley Hines’s team, where each motor was subject to thermal aging processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In the same way as conducted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, the sensory data were pre-processed and the time-domain features were extracted, with the top 121 features being employed here in this study. Due to the different total lifetimes, it can be reasonably assumed that the health status of motors at each life cycles are different, mimicking the different fault types of different companies.
We choose PyTorch 1.2.0 and Python 3.73 as machine learning library in our federated learning framework for following reasons: easy to use API, multi GPU support, python support, custom data loaders and simplified pre-processors. In our experiment, we made the assumption that all companies are using the same features extracted from sensor data. They are using the Neural Network (NN) models provided by PyTorch for fault detection. Both simple and complex neural network architecture structures were used. In the simple NN model, it only has input (121 features) and output layers (2 prediction results). That is the size of simpleNN model (i.e., <math id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">s</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑠</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">s</annotation></semantics></math> in table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ III MPC-enabled Federated Learning Framework ‣ Two-Phase Multi-Party Computation Enabled Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>) is equal to 242. In the complexNN model, another hidden layer with 60 neurons is added. Hence, the size of complexNN model is equal to 7380.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.13" class="ltx_p">A series of experiments are conducted on Local-SingleServer environment, by increasing the number of parties (i.e., processes) from 4 to 128. The number and size of messages(depends on the size of the model parameters) are illustrated on Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-D Communication Cost ‣ IV Experiment Design and Results ‣ Two-Phase Multi-Party Computation Enabled Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> and <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-D Communication Cost ‣ IV Experiment Design and Results ‣ Two-Phase Multi-Party Computation Enabled Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> respectively. The traditional Peer-to-Peer MPC-enabled FL framework has low scalability, as both the number and size of messages increase dramatically (squarely) with respect to the number of parties. As expected in theoretical analysis, the proposed two-phase method dramatically reduces the number and size of messages, and thus improve system scalability.
More details of Two-Phase framework are further illustrated in Figure <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IV-D Communication Cost ‣ IV Experiment Design and Results ‣ Two-Phase Multi-Party Computation Enabled Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we presented a Two-Phase MPC-enabled FL framework. It supports multiple organizations to collectively learn a machine learning model, while keeping private data on-premise. Both Additive and Shamir secret sharing MPC protocols are adopted to aggregate lo- cal models in a privacy-preserving manner. The proposed federated learning framework is further integrated with an IIoT platform for smart manufacturing. The effectiveness of federated learning has been verified as it can build a better model than that trained on silo data sets and achieves comparable prediction accuracy versus the traditional centralized learning. Compared with the traditional Peer-to-Peer framework, the Two-Phase MPC-enabled FL framework significantly reduce communication cost and improves system scalability. Depending on the number of parties, it achieves 2 to 25 times of speed-up on execution time of federated learning for both simple and complex neural network models.
In the future, we will extend our work to include various application domains to exploit the advantages of FL in practice. Besides horizontal FL, vertical FL and transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> will also be investigated to enable collaborations across multiple domains. Further, we will continue our research on system development for performance and scalability enhancement by considering large number of parties on AWS-SameRegion and AWS-CrossRegion with large datasets, as well as on privacy-preserving and cyber security techniques to deal with malicious users who negatively affect federated learning effectiveness in a trustless environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
