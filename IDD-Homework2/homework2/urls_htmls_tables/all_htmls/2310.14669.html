<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) technology that enables collaborative training and learning of a global ML model based on aggregating distributed local model updates. However, security and privacy guarantees could be compromised due to malicious participants and the centralized FL server. This paper proposed a bi-level blockchained architecture for secure federated learning-based traffic prediction. The bottom and top layer blockchain store the local model and global aggregated parameters accordingly, and the distributed homomorphic-encrypted federated averaging (DHFA) scheme addresses the secure computation problems. We propose the partial private key distribution protocol and a partially homomorphic encryption/decryption scheme to achieve the distributed privacy-preserving federated averaging model. We conduct extensive experiments to measure the running time of DHFA operations, quantify the read and write performance of the blockchain network, and elucidate the impacts of varying regional group sizes and model complexities on the resulting prediction accuracy for the online traffic flow prediction task. The results indicate that the proposed system can facilitate secure and decentralized federated learning for real-world traffic prediction tasks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traffic prediction plays a significant role in improving the utilization of traffic network capacity while also helping alleviate congestion by empowering traffic management centers (TMCs) and road operators to control traffic more effectively. In addition, other applications such as route guidance and navigation systems can leverage traffic prediction methods to provide travelers with more accurate information in real time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite their strong performance in the literature, state-of-the-art traffic prediction models (e.g., deep learning (DL) models) can only perform well if trained using centralized big traffic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, centralized approaches are becoming unsuitable for emerging intelligent transportation systems (ITS) where data collection is decentralized, dynamic, and performed by heterogeneous devices (e.g., sensors, mobile phones, connected vehicles). In contrast to centralized methods, collaborative and decentralized ML approaches can better match the ITS environment, allowing models to be trained and updated online directly at the network edge to improve response time and modeling efficiency for critical ITS applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Federated learning (FL) has shown promise in facilitating privacy-preserving and collaborative machine learning across multiple application domains (e.g., healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, internet of things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>). During the FL process for traffic flow prediction, devices use their locally stored data to train location-specific traffic flow prediction models, which are periodically merged to generate a global model from the contributions of each participant. Consequently, FL can train transportation models decentrally, without necessitating data sharing, protecting the privacy of each participant’s data. For these reasons, FL is a strong candidate for improving traffic prediction for emerging ITS.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although the existing literature on FL-based traffic prediction is sparse, some work has experimented with FL for traffic flow prediction models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, the existing work generally focuses on the large-scale macro FL case, where significant volumes of historical data are collected by a small number of participating organizations possessing sufficient processing power. Moreover, existing experimental setups appear to simulate FL using identical data shards across participants. This scenario is not practical given the increasing decentralization of ITS, where participants are heterogeneous with respect to data volumes and computing resources and collect location-specific data sets. The reader is referred to our recent critical review on traffic prediction methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Most importantly, a fundamental challenge in fully decentralized federated learning is to prevent the client from reconstructing the private data of another client from its shared updates while maintaining a good level of utility for the learned models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, such local privacy approaches often have a high cost in utility and do not easily integrate with fully decentralized algorithms  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. To address these existing drawbacks, homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> could be a potential solution. Compared to other cryptography techniques, homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that permits users to perform computations on its encrypted data without decrypting it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. It allows data to be encrypted and outsourced to a federated learning server or other computing devices. The challenge is how to integrate homomorphic encryption with federated learning procedures to preserve privacy and secure computation.</p>

To address the different geographic location properties of intelligent vehicles and roadway sensors and the problems of data integrity, traceability, and system scalability, the bottom layer blockchain serves as the ledger to record the local model parameters generated from the roadside edge nodes (REN) and provide the forensics for global averaging parameters. To address the secure computation problems when the federated learning server aggregates device updates in the traditional FL procedure, we propose the DHFA (distributed homomorphic-encrypted federated averaging) algorithm and store the averaged global model parameters in the top layer blockchain to provide data security and privacy.</p>

RENs, consisting of a static sensor paired with an edge computing device, collect the traffic data at a fixed position within each corridor region. Later, each REN within a regional group will participate in the local model training process and encrypt their local model parameters. Then, acting as clients, each REN will interact with peers and orderers nodes within the bottom layer blockchain. After one round of the FL process, each REN submits a transaction proposal containing the HE-encrypted local model parameter to all the edge computing
devices acting as peers for endorsements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Each peer evaluates the transaction proposal and sends back an endorsement to the client (REN). Each REN packages the received endorsements into a transaction and
submits it to the edge computing devices, which act as orderer nodes.

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After sufficient local models are deposited to a given regional BL BC, the DHFA group will act as the client to compute the homomorphic-encrypted federated averaging results for the global parameters and subsequently store them in the top layer blockchain. The DHFA group will interact with the peers and the orderer nodes in the top-layer blockchain. After one round of the federated averaging process, the DHFA group will submit a transaction proposal containing the DHFA-protected global model parameter to all the edge computing devices acting as peers for endorsements. After the same evaluation process, the peer nodes will send back an endorsement to the DHFA group. The DHFA group packages all the received endorsements into a transaction and submits it to the top layer orderer nodes. The orderer nodes will establish an unambiguous order on blockchain transactions and batch them into a new block on the top layer blockchain.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-E Workflow of B2SFL ‣ III System Architecture ‣ B2SFL: A Bi-level Blockchained Architecture for Secure Federated Learning-based Traffic Prediction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the federated learning workflow for online and location-aware traffic flow prediction within the proposed architecture. First, during initialization, the public/private key is generated for each region using the proposed HE-IBE (holomorphic encryption - identity-based encryption) and is distributed to the participants. Then, throughout the FL process, the RENs within a pre-defined geographic region continuously collect local traffic data using their sensors (e.g., loop detector, LIDAR). During an FL round, after collecting sufficient local traffic data, each REN will leverage a combination of newly collected and historical data to train its local version of the global FL model. After training, the new model is encrypted using the regional key to protect the privacy and security of the local model parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Next, REN encapsulates encrypted local model parameters within a blockchain transaction, which is sent to the peer nodes of their regional BL blockchain. The peer nodes validate the transaction and return a signed endorsement to REN. After receiving the necessary endorsements, the REN packages them into a digitally signed transaction and sends the transaction to the orderer nodes. After that, the orderer nodes will enact the consensus process, package newly submitted local models into a new block, and transfer the new block to the peers in their respective BL BC, where it is used to update the ledger state.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After block generation, the new block of updated regional global models is retrieved from the BL blockchain by the DHFA nodes acting as clients. To ensure fault tolerance of the synchronized FL process, we propose a timeout system parameter to account for communication or system outages for RENs. Specifically, the timeout value can be implemented at the DHFA node level using a client application, or implemented within the business logic of a respective BL blockchain. Once the local models of all participating RENs have been committed to the regional BL BC that manages the FL process, or when the current round timeout value is reached, the DHFA nodes will retrieve the local models and execute FedAVG.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">After retrieving the local models, the proposed HE-FedAVG (Alg. 4) is executed to average the encrypted local model parameters into an updated version of the region-specific model. The newly encrypted regional model parameters are then transferred to the associated RENs. At the same time, the new parameters are also encapsulated in a blockchain transaction and are subsequently stored on the TL blockchain using the same transaction processing flow. Once the REN receives the updated model parameters, they are decrypted and used to update the REN’s local copy of the regional prediction model, and the process repeats.</p>

Only Qi BFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and our proposed system offer partial HE features, and our scheme is based on the DHFA, which supports the decentralized FedAvg method. The bi-level blockchain architecture with DHFA encryption can protect data security in a more efficient and end-to-end privacy-preserving way. We provide detailed comparative experiments with Qi BFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> in the HE performance evaluation section. For the Li BFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, Zhao BFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, Fabric FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, BAFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, Biscotti BFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and Hierarchical BFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, we conduct the table comparison results since their evaluation is based on other cryptography techniques, FL simulation results, and other evaluation metrics. Most existing schemes utilize differential privacy requiring adding noise for the data. Our proposed DHFA scheme can solve the centralized FL server issue and perform calculations on the encrypted data.</p>

Each FL simulation consists of 1165 rounds, where the duration of each round is one hour. In our dataset, sensors collect flow data at a 5-minute resolution, corresponding to twelve new data instances per hour per sensor. The GRU models are designed to process input instances sequentially, and one hour of historical flow data is used to generate the flow prediction for the next five minutes.

Notably, the bottom x-axis is scaled exponentially. In comparison, the unencrypted federated averaging algorithm generally runs on the order of milliseconds due to its simplicity. Consequently, integrating DHFA is computationally expensive compared to a system without encryption and is suitable for privacy-centric ITS applications.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed a bi-level blockchain architecture for secure federated learning-based traffic prediction.
The bottom and top layer blockchains store local and aggregated global parameters. We design the partial private key distribution protocol and the partially homomorphic encryption scheme to achieve the privacy-preserving federated averaging procedure. We conducted both system correctness and security discussions to validate our design. We implemented the proposed architecture by utilizing Hyperledger Fabric, Jspaillier library, and the Google Colab platform. The experiment results indicate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient for decentralized federated averaging schemes and real-world traffic prediction tasks.</p>
