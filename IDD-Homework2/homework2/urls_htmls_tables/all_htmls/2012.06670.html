<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an approach to collaboratively train a model across multiple parties without sharing data between parties or an aggregator. It is used both in the consumer domain to protect personal data as well as in enterprise settings, where dealing with data domicile regulation and the pragmatics of data silos are the main drivers. While gradient boosted tree implementations such as XGBoost have been very successful for many use cases, its federated learning adaptations tend to be very slow due to using cryptographic and privacy methods and have not experienced widespread use. We propose the Party-Adaptive XGBoost (PAX) for federated learning, a novel implementation of gradient boosting which utilizes a party adaptive histogram aggregation method, without the need for data encryption. It constructs a surrogate representation of the data distribution for finding splits of the decision tree. Our experimental results demonstrate strong model performance, especially on non-IID distributions, and significantly faster training run-time across different data sets than existing federated implementations. This approach makes the use of gradient boosted trees practical in enterprise federated learning.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Gradient boosted decision trees, e.g., XGBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, have recently been proposed as a new ensemble tree-based model to improve the performance of CART decision trees.
It utilizes a gradient-boosting based approach to optimize the tree split against a predefined loss function, e.g., mean-squared loss for regression problems and cross-entropy loss for classification problems, etc.
As it exhibits good performances for different types of machine learning (ML) problems, it has gained a lot of attention in both the Kaggle community and real-world applications.
Moreover, since it is a tree-based model, it also pertains good explainability of tree models which deep learning models struggle with.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has been recently proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to enable collaborative training of ML models among multiple parties where each party can keep its data to itself and there is no need to bring data to a central location.
This approach has been beneficial for use cases in which the privacy of consumer data is important, such as data on cell phone apps, as well as scenarios in which regulation limits the movement of data. For example, many countries have adopted legislation that person identifying data cannot be moved outside of their jurisdiction or a jurisdiction with lesser privacy protection.
Examples of such regulations include the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Federated learning also found good use in scenarios where large amounts of data are produced in different locations such as different data centers, application silos, or Cloud providers, where bringing all data together would be impractical. Applications of federated learning on consumer devices, such as mobile devices or vehicles, typically require advanced privacy guarantees such as those provided by differential privacy and the addition of differentially private noise as part of the learning process.
Different frameworks for FL have been proposed, including FATE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, IBM FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and Tensorflow Federated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, both for production and experimental use.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The most common topology for federated learning uses a single aggregator (or coordinator), which coordinates the federated learning process. The learning process is divided into one part that takes place at each party to the federated learning job and another that takes place at the aggregator. When designing a federated learning algorithm we have to choose what goes where. There has been significant work on training neural networks, and other models based on a gradient descent training process, in a federated way. In this case, the local parties train neural networks and send updates on their locally trained models - weights or gradients - to the aggregator, which in turn merges the local updates and creates a new shared model that is often sent back to the parties for another round of training off this updated model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, federated learning poses some specific issues typically not present in centralized machine learning: there is no overall perspective of the training data and its properties since it is not shared. This limits the assumptions we can make about the training dataset. The data also might be unbalanced between parties. One party might have many more samples than others and the distributions might be quite different. This is more a feature than a bug as the point of the federation is to bring data together that might reflect local variety and - jointly - represent a more globally representative dataset. However, this may entail distributional imbalances, lack of statistical independence, missing values, and other issues related to the independent and identical distribution (IID) assumption of the dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing to other popular ML models, like, neural networks and logistic models, among others, XGBoost has many unique advantages that increase its suitability for FL systems.
Firstly, XGBoost can deal with missing data out of the box, while other ML models require additional processing on the training data. Popular approaches, such as replacing the missing feature values with the mean value, usually require coordination among parties and therefore result in large communication overhead.
Secondly, XGBoost does not require an extensive set of pre-processing operations, which saves significant communication costs and reduces private data leakage as a result of the additional communication required.
The performance of classic ML models, for instance, linear models, logistic models and SVMs, etc., often relies heavily on good pre-processing strategies.
And the standard pre-processing methods, like normalization and scaling, again require coordination among parties especially when parties’ local datasets are heterogeneous, a well-known characteristic of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">While some federated approaches to gradient boosting trees have been proposed, they typically focus on consumer FL, where the application of expensive security and privacy methods are necessary. As a result, these approaches often entail poor model performance compared to centralized gradient boosting trees. Adoption has been limited for enterprise settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on enterprise use cases and we propose Party-Adaptive XGBoost (PAX), an algorithm to train XGBoost models in FL settings. We demonstrate that PAX outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches under varied data distributions that mimic real FL setting.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, researchers have devoted most of their efforts designing efficient FL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to train neural networks and general linear models. However, we find that relatively small number of works focus on FL algorithms for training gradient boosting models. As of writing, current federated learning frameworks that provide implementations of gradient boosted trees includes FATE <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://fate.fedai.org/</span></span></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and Secure XGBoost from MC2 <span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>https://github.com/mc2-project/secure-xgboost</span></span></span>. Largely, the key differences within the existing literature for gradient boosted trees trained via FL are: i) horizontal or vertical FL implementations and ii) use of encryption-based security protocols to protect data.</p>

<section id="S2.SS1" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Horizontal vs Vertical FL</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on how parties shared the training data samples, FL can be categorized into two different types: horizontal and vertical FL.
Horizontal FL considers the shared set of features, while vertical FL considers the shared set of samples across each party. Depending on the data partition structure, the communication topology of the FL system, as well as the corresponding exchanging information can change largely.
Many of the existing literature considers a horizontal data partition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Other methods such as SecureBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> (also part of FATE<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>FATE also provides a horizontal FL variant of GBT</span></span></span>), S-XGB and HESS-XGB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and SecureGBM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> considers the vertical partition of the data. In most of the proposed methods, the information exchanged in these algorithms are based primarily on the gradients, hessians, and tree split decision value thresholds of the loss with respect to each of the party’s local data.
In this work, our proposed algorithm work with horizontal federated learning, which also exchanges gradients, hessians, and also tree split decision value thresholds.
However, our proposed PAX uses a novel party-adaptive histogram-based partition driven approach that we empirically demonstrate can handle Non-IID data better than the baselines.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Encryption-based protocols</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the issue of data privacy and security, various methods have been implemented to prevent an adversary from getting access to the party’s local raw data distribution. Many of the existing FL-based gradient boosting methods employ an encryption-based security protocol. For example, SecureBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, FedXGB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and HESS-XGB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> employs homomorphic encryption, while methods such as S-XGB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and PrivColl <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> use Secret Sharing, and Li et. al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> implements a Locality Sensitivity Hashing (LSH) method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although majority of the encryption methods provide lossless or near lossless guarantees on privacy protection while maintaining comparable model accuracy than centralized XGBoost, it does so with a significant overhead to both computational and network communication costs. This trade-off, as a result, significantly increases the runtime of the training process. Alternatively, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed a clustering-based k-anonymity scheme, without the use of encryption, for protecting the party’s local data. However, a drawback to this approach entails that the size of the virtual cluster needs to be set before hand and does not dynamically adapt to the local party’s data distribution, which can be greatly different in a FL system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on enterprise settings where the collaborations do not require secure aggregation schemes. Our design does not utilize cryptosystems, yielding significant training time advantages over some of the prior methods. Our proposed method, instead, utilizes a party-adaptive histogram-based method to approximate the raw distribution of the data through a surrogate representation of the data.
Therefore, parties does not need to reveal their exact local data distributions to others, and they can choose their own granularity to reveal the data information and collaboratively grow the tree.</p>

The aggregator then based on the FL algorithm fuses the collected replies and uses the fusion results to update the global ML model.
A FL algorithm may contain several round of training to obtain the final global model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most FL algorithms are based on distributed SGD, like FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. They were proposed to train neural networks and can also be applied to general linear models, like logistic models. These FL algorithms assume that a model architecture is provided to both the aggregator and parties before the FL training, and this model architecture, e.g., a neural network structure, won’t change during the course of the FL training. Queries in these algorithms usually contains the current global model’s parameters and requests the parties’ updated model parameters or gradients.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, these existing FL algorithms cannot be applied to train tree based models such as CART decision trees and XGBoost. It is nontrivial to design an algorithm to train a tree based model in a federated learning fashion. Firstly, the model architecture, i.e., the tree structure, will change as the training proceeds. The tree grows as more information is collected. Secondly, it is not straightforward to decide what information will be shared by the parties with the aggregator without revealing the parties’ private data. Thirdly, it is not easy to deal with data heterogeneity among parties. Finally, the aggregator should be able to evaluate different termination criteria from a global perspective as trees based models have various termination criteria, e.g., maximum tree depth and minimum information gain, among others.</p>

We use a version of the dataset that was prepared and preprocessed from Kaggle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. The dataset features 30 attributes pertaining to flight times, status, and delay information with many of the features being significantly skewed and non-IID. In our modeling task, we considered a binary classification where our target attribute is to predict whether or not a flight would be delayed or not. Each party is trained on 1,000 samples, based on two scenarios where the samples were selected randomly (based on uniform distribution) and another variant of the dataset where the samples selected are balanced based on the target labels. For testing set of our model, we sample another 1,000 instances based on the two different sampling methods. For our evaluation metrics, we consider accuracy (ACC), precision (PRE), recall (REC), area under the curve (AUC), and the F1 score (F1). Our reported results will be based on taking the average of the three parties’ metrics based on the evaluation on the test set. Furthermore, for each algorithm, we also report the total execution time for training the model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the robustness of our method, we perform a systematic analysis of our algorithm’s performance by re-partitioning the data samples across the three parties. The main motivation behind this analysis is to evaluate how well our algorithm can adapt to different dataset sizes across each party and how they can influence the average performance of our model. For this evaluation, we utilize the same randomly sampled airline delay dataset from our previous evaluation and reallocate the distribution of the data. In the first allocation (Partition 1), we begin with each party having the same number of samples. From each partition types, we re-partition our dataset by first randomly taking half (50%) of the data from Party 2 and appending it to Party 1. Then, we similarly take approximately two-thirds of the data from Party 3 and move it to Party 2. The result of this process yields the five different partitions as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.2 Data Partition Evaluation to Emulate Party’s Data Heterogeneity ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Adaptive Histogram-Based Gradient Boosted Trees for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

For each dataset variation, Airline Random and Balanced, we report the metrics described in our experimental setup. From our experimental results, we can empirically observe that our model outperforms both the Homo SecureBoost and the Logistic Regression models achieving 88% and 87% accuracy for the random and balanced datasets respectively. Despite significant improvements for the remaining two models evaluated under the balanced dataset, we observe that our approach still outperforms over both methods. From these results, we can infer that majority of the errors from Homo SecureBoost derive from the randomly appended number used in their secure histogram aggregation method, which impacted the overall choice of the feature-value threshold during the boosting process, therefore yielding lower accuracies compared to our approach.</p>

Comparing between our method and SecureBoost, our model takes significantly less time to train compared to Homo SecureBoost. As FATE’s Homo SecureBoost utilizes a cryptographic routines for data protection, this consequently incurs even more computational overhead as exhibited in the walltime measurements obtained in our experiments. On the other hand, although the runtime for logistic regression is significantly much shorter than that of our method, the time taken does not fully justify for the complexity of the model and the poor results obtained in the modeling task (Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.3 Experiment Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Adaptive Histogram-Based Gradient Boosted Trees for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).</p>

Overall, we see that despite how we change the partitions, PAX is able to maintain robust performance in shifting distributions. Even in extreme partition scenarios, where Party 1 held over 90% and Party 3 held less than 1% of the data (Partition 5), we see that our method even improved performance over the balanced results achieving the highest accuracy of 91% - even greater than when the dataset is balanced (Partition 1). We speculate that this increase in accuracy occurred as Party 1 holds the majority of the data in the federation, thereby having enough samples to be able to provide a sufficient amount of information without having to compensate a huge loss of accuracy. Conversely, Party 3 only having few samples would be a major risk to exposing raw data does not provide as much to the model, and therefore contributes a relatively small amount of information to the modeling process. This empirically demonstrates that our proposed method is robust as it is able to adapt to different shifts in the data distribution and adopt the best histogram based on the learning task at hand. Further, these results show how PAX overcomes one of the main challenges of training models in FL.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed the Party-Adaptive XGBoost (PAX) approach for training a gradient boosted decision tree model in a Federated Learning setting. In this approach we use histograms to communicate from parties to the aggregator. PAX surrogate histograms can be adapted to the specifics of the properties of a party’s data and the downstream learning task and, thus, can address imbalances of data between parties, which are commonly difficult to deal with in a federated learning setting. In both our empirical model evaluation and partition reallocation experiments, we have demonstrated that our method is able to outperform state of the art methods both in model performance and training time. This applies to the benchmark Homo Secure Boost approach as well as to the federated logistic regression we use as a reference point. The good model performance and overall faster training time, our method makes it suitable for enterprise federated learning use cases not requiring consumer use case differential privacy guarantees.</p>
