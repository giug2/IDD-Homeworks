<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Is it possible to develop an “AI Pathologist” to pass the board-certified examination of the American Board of Pathology (ABP)? To build such a system, three challenges need to be addressed. First, we need to create a visual question answering (VQA) dataset where the AI agent is presented with a pathology image together with a question and is asked to give the correct answer.
Due to privacy concerns, pathology images are usually not publicly available. Besides, only well-trained pathologists can understand pathology images, but they barely have time to help create datasets for AI research. The second challenge is: due to the fact that it is difficult to hire highly experienced pathologists to create pathology visual questions and answers, the resulting pathology VQA dataset may contain errors such as some questions may not be relevant to the image or the answers are not given correctly. Training pathology VQA models using these noisy or even erroneous data will lead to problematic models that cannot generalize well on unseen images. The third challenge is: the medical concepts and knowledge covered in pathology question-answer (QA) pairs are very diverse while the number of QA pairs available for modeling training is limited. How to learn effective representations of diverse medical concepts based on limited data is technically demanding.
In this paper, we aim to address these three challenges. To our best knowledge, our work represents the first one addressing the pathology VQA problem. To deal with the issue that a publicly available pathology VQA dataset is lacking, we create PathVQA, a VQA dataset with 32,795 questions asked from 4,998 pathology images. The questions in PathVQA are similar to those in the ABP tests.
To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset for pathology VQA.
To address the second challenge, we propose a learning-by-ignoring approach which automatically identifies training examples
that have bad-quality and remove them from the training dataset.
To address the third challenge, we propose to use cross-modal self-supervised learning to learn powerful visual and textual representations jointly.
We perform experiments on our created PathVQA dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed learning-by-ignoring method and cross-modal self-supervised learning methods.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Pathology studies the causes and effects of diseases or injuries. It underpins every aspect of patient care, such as diagnostic testing, providing treatment advice, preventing diseases using cutting-edge genetic technologies, to name a few. Medical professionals practicing pathology are called pathologists, who examine bodies and body tissues. To become a board-certificated pathologist in the US, a medical professional needs to pass a certification examination organized by the American Board of Pathology (ABP), which is a very challenging task. We are interested in asking: whether an artificial intelligence (AI) system can be developed to pass the ABP examination? It is an important step towards achieving AI-aided clinical decision support and clinical education. Among the ABP test questions, one major type is to understand the pathology images. Given a pathology image and a question, the examinees are asked to select a correct answer. Such a problem is called visual question answering (VQA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Antol et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> in the AI community. VQA is an interdisciplinary research problem that has drawn extensive attention recently. Given an image (e.g., an image showing a dog is chasing a ball) and a question asked about the visual content of the image (e.g., “what is the dog chasing?”), VQA aims to develop AI algorithms to infer the correct answer (e.g., “ball”). VQA requires a deep comprehension of both images and textual questions, as well as the relationship between visual objects and textual entities, which is technically very demanding.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To train an AI system to perform VQA on pathology images and pass the ABP test, we first need to collect a dataset containing questions similar to those in the ABP test. ABP provides some sample questions, but they are too few to be useful for training data-driven models. Some commercial institutes provide a larger number of practice questions, but they are very expensive to buy and they cannot be shared with the public due to copyright issues. One possible way to create pathology VQA dataset is to leverage crowdsourcing, which is used successfully for creating general domain VQA datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Malinowski &amp; Fritz, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Antol et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Ren et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015a</a>; Johnson et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Goyal et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
However, it is much more challenging to build medical VQA datasets than general domain VQA datasets via crowdsourcing. First, medical images such as pathology images are highly domain-specific, which can only be interpreted by well-educated medical professionals. It is very difficult and expensive to hire medical professionals to help create medical VQA datasets.
Second, to create a VQA dataset, one first needs to collect an image dataset. While images in the general domain are pervasive, medical images are very difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we resort to pathology textbooks, especially those that are freely accessible online, as well as online digital libraries. These textbooks contain a lot of pathology images, covering the entire domain of pathology. Each image has a caption describing pathological findings in the image. The caption is carefully worded and clinically precise. We extract images and captions from the textbooks and online digital libraries. Given these images, question-answer pairs are created based on image captions. These QA pairs are verified by medical professionals to ensure clinical meaningfulness and correctness. In the end, we create a pathology VQA dataset called PathVQA, which contains 32,795 questions asked from 4,998 pathology images. To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset for pathology VQA.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Given the pathology VQA dataset, the next step is to develop a pathology VQA system, which is also very challenging, due to the following reasons. First, while we have tried our best to ensure the clinical correctness of the PathVQA dataset, it may still contain noises and errors that can only be identified by very experienced pathologists who unfortunately do not have time to do so for all the data examples in PathVQA. To address this problem, we propose a learning-by-ignoring method which can automatically identify bad-quality data (errors, noises, outliers, etc.) and remove them from the training set.
The learning-by-ignoring strategy analyzes the collection of training examples holistically and determines which ones should be ignored. The likelihood of ignoring each training example is learned by maximizing the performance on the validation set in a bi-level optimization framework.
The second challenge is: the medical concepts involved in PathVQA are very diverse while the number of question-answer pairs available for training is limited.
Learning effective representations of these diverse medical concepts using limited data is technically difficult. Poorly learned representations lead to inferior VQA performance.
To address the second challenge,
we propose cross-modal self-supervised learning approaches to pretrain the representation learning modules in VQA models for obtaining effective visual and textual embeddings.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gidaris et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018b</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016a</a>; Pathak et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016b</a>)</cite> is an unsupervised learning approach which creates auxiliary tasks on input data without using human-provided labels and learns data representations by solving these auxiliary tasks. We create two types of cross-modal SSL tasks: 1) given an image and a question, judge whether this question is asked from this image; 2) given an image and an answer, judge whether this answer is relevant to this image. We also conduct a single-modal SSL on question-answer pairs: we pretrain the text encoder by predicting answers only based on the questions without considering the input images.
Experiments on our developed PathVQA dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To our best knowledge, there are two existing datasets for medical visual question
answering.
The VQA-Med <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abacha et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> dataset is created on 4,200 radiology images and has 15,292 question-answer pairs. Most of the questions are in multiple-choice (MC) style and can be answered by multi-way classifiers.
This makes the difficulty of this dataset significantly lower.
VQA-RAD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lau et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> is a manually-crafted dataset where questions and answers are given by clinicians on radiology images. It has 3515 questions of 11 types.
Our dataset differs from VQA-Med and VQA-RAD in two-fold. First, ours is about pathology while VQA-Med and VQA-RAD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lau et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> are both about radiology. Second, our dataset is a truly challenging QA dataset where most of the questions are open-ended while in VQA-Med and VQA-RAD the majority of questions have a fixed number of candidate answers and can be answered by multi-way classification. Besides, the number of questions in our dataset is much larger than that in VQA-Med and VQA-RAD.</p>

In our PathVQA dataset, the number of training data examples is not very large (tens of thousands), we can directly learn an ignoring variable for each data example. In other applications, if there are millions of training examples, learning millions of ignoring variables may not be a good choice. Under such circumstances, we can use a neural network (called ignoring network) to parameterize the ignoring variable, where the input of the network is a feature representation of the data example and the output of the network is an ignoring variable. The ignoring network and the VQA model can share the same encoder used for representation learning.</p>

Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Self-supervised learning on PathVQA ‣ 4 Methods ‣ Pathological Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the idea.
We define this task on two types of pairs: image-question and image-answer. For image-question CMSSL, given an image and a question, if the question is asked based on the content of the image, then they are labeled as a match. Otherwise, they are labeled as not a match. The image encoder and question encoder are learned jointly to predict whether an image and a question match with each other. Such a task can help to learn the correspondence between image regions and words in the question.
The encoders learned in CMSSL are used to initialize the encoders in VQA models, which are then finetuned on the PathVQA dataset.
We also perform CMSSL on image-answer pairs: given an image and an answer, judge whether this answer is relevant to the image. We use the question encoder to encode the answer.
In addition, we perform single modal SSL on question-answer pairs (SSL-QA),
to capture the semantic correspondence between words in questions and answers. In SSL-QA, we first pretrain the question encoder by predicting answers solely based on questions themselves without using image information, then finetune the question encoder together with other modules in the full VQA task involving images. Given CMSSL on image-question pairs, CMSSL on image-answer pairs, and SSL-QA, we perform them simultaneously in a multi-task learning framework which minimizes the weighted sum of losses of the three SSL tasks.</p>

relationship encoder, a language encoder,
and a cross-modal encoder. The three encoders are built mostly based on two kinds of attention layers — self-attention layers and cross-attention layers. The object
relationship encoder and the language encoder are both single-modality encoders. Each
layer of them contains a self-attention sub-layer and a feed-forward sub-layer, where the feed-forward sub-layer is composed
of two fully-connected sub-layers. A cross-modal
encoder is proposed to learn the connections between
vision and language. Each layer of it consists of two self-attention
sub-layers, one bi-directional cross-attention sub-layer,

It extends the idea of co-attention into bilinear attention which considers every pair
of multimodal channels. It learns bilinear attention distributions using the bilinear attention networks (BAN) and uses low rank approximation techniques to approximate the bilinear interaction between question embeddings and image embeddings. It also proposes residual learning of attention which keeps
the size of intermediate features constant.</p>

In the PathVQA dataset, the frequencies of question categories are imbalanced. Because of this, during the partition process, we perform sampling to ensure the frequencies of these categories in each set to be consistent. There are 19,755 question-answer pairs in the training set, 6,279 in the validation set, and 6,761 in the testing set. For all the data examples in the validation set and test set, senior radiologists helped to carefully examine them to ensure they are clinically correct.

In the cross-modal SSL pretraining on Method 2, similar to that on Method 1, we train a linear classifier with a dimension of 1,280 to predict whether two modalities of data match or not. For learning-by-ignoring, we update ignoring variables using the Adam optimizer, with an initial learning rate of 0.01.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Implementation details ‣ 5.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Pathological Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the VQA performance achieved by different methods. From this table, we make the following observations. <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">First</span>, for both Method 1 and Method 2, applying learning-by-ignoring (LBI) improves the performance. This demonstrates the effectiveness of LBI in improving the generalization ability of trained VQA models. LBI learns to identify and remove noisy and erroneous training data examples, which can avoid the model to be distorted by such bad-quality examples.
<span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Second</span>, for both Method 1 and 2, applying cross-modal SSL (CMSSL) methods including CMSSL-IQ and CMSSL-IA improves the performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of CMSSL. CMSSL uses auxiliary tasks, including judging whether an image matches with a question and judging whether an image matches with an answer, to learn semantic correspondence between image regions and words in questions/answers, which can improve the effectiveness of visual and textual representations for accurate VQA. <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Third</span>, using SSL-QA improves VQA performance of Method 1 and 2. SSL-QA learns the correspondence between words in questions and words in answers, which can better extract semantic representations of questions and answers.
<span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fourth</span>, joint pretraining which performs CMSSL-IQ, CMSSL-IA, and SSL-QA jointly achieves better performance than performing the three SSL tasks individually, for both Method 1 and 2. This is because letting the model solve several SSL tasks simultaneously is more challenging, which encourages the model to learn more powerful textual and visual representations. <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fifth</span>, applying both joint pretraining and learning-by-ignoring achieves the best performance in Method 1 and 2.</p>

This is because it is relatively easy to recognize image regions of interest for “where” questions, which helps the model to give the correct answer.

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One may suspect how much information in images are used during the inference of the answers? Could it be possible that the models simply learn the correlations between questions and answers and ignore the images? In light of these concerns, we perform studies where the images are not fed into VQA models and only questions are used as inputs for inferring answers. Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Implementation details ‣ 5.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Pathological Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the results of not using images (“Method 1/2 without image”). As can be seen, for both Method 1 and 2, ignoring images leads to substantial degradation of performance. This shows that images in our dataset provide valuable information for VQA and PathVQA is a meaningful VQA dataset. The models trained on our datasets are not degenerated to simply capture the correlation between questions and answers.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, towards the goal of developing AI systems to pass the board-certificated examinations of the American Board of Pathology and fostering research in medical visual question answering, we build a pathology VQA dataset – PathVQA – that contains 32,795 question-answer pairs of 8 categories, generated from 4,998 images. Majority of questions in our dataset are open-ended, posing great challenges for the medical VQA research. Our dataset is publicly available. To address the challenges that the training data may contain errors and the effective representations of pathology images and questions are difficult to learn on limited data, we propose a learning-by-ignoring approach to automatically identify and remove problematic training examples and develop cross-modal self-supervised learning approaches to learn visual and textual representations effectively.
The experiments on our collected PathVQA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p>

The first five datasets are in the general domain while the last three are in the medical domain. Not surprisingly, the size of general-domain datasets (including the number of images and question-answer pairs) is much larger than that of medical datasets since general-domain images are much more available publicly and there are many qualified human annotators to generate QA pairs on general images. Our dataset is larger than the two medical datasets: VQA-Med and VQA-RAD, and majority of questions in our dataset are open-ended while majority of questions in VQA-Med and VQA-RAD are in multiple-choices style.</p>

<div id="A1.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A1.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A number of visual question answering datasets have been developed in the general domain. DAQUAR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Malinowski &amp; Fritz, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> is built on top of the NYU-Depth V2 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Silberman et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> which contains RGBD images of indoor scenes. DAQUAR consists of (1) synthetic question-answer pairs that are automatically generated based on textual templates and (2) human-created question-answer pairs produced by five annotators. The VQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Antol et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> is developed on real images in MS COCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> and abstract scene images
in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Antol et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Zitnick &amp; Parikh, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>. The
question-answer pairs are created by human annotators who are encouraged to ask “interesting” and “diverse” questions. VQA v2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Goyal et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is extended from the VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Antol et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> dataset to achieve more balance between visual and textual information, by collecting complementary images in a way that each question is associated with a pair of similar images with different answers. In the COCO-QA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ren et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015a</a>)</cite> dataset, the question-answer pairs are automatically generated from image captions based on syntactic parsing and linguistic rules. CLEVR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Johnson et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Kembhavi et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is a dataset developed on rendered images of spatially related objects (including cube, sphere, and cylinder) with different sizes, materials, and colors. The locations and attributes of objects are annotated for each image. The questions are automatically generated from the annotations.</p>
