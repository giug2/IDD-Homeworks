<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) allows model training from local data collected by edge/mobile devices while preserving data privacy, which has wide applicability to image and vision applications. A challenge is that client devices in FL usually have much more limited computation and communication resources compared to servers in a datacenter. To overcome this challenge, we propose <em id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">PruneFL</em> – a novel FL approach with adaptive and distributed parameter pruning, which adapts the model size during FL to reduce both communication and computation overhead and minimize the overall training time, while maintaining a similar accuracy as the original model. PruneFL includes initial pruning at a selected client and further pruning as part of the FL process. The model size is adapted during this process, which includes maximizing the approximate empirical risk reduction divided by the time of one FL round. Our experiments with various datasets on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi) show that: (i) we significantly reduce the training time compared to conventional FL and various other pruning-based methods; (ii) the pruned model with automatically determined size converges to an accuracy that is very similar to the original model, and it is also a lottery ticket of the original model.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The past decade has seen a rapid development of machine learning algorithms and applications, particularly in the area of deep neural networks (DNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, a huge volume of training data is usually required to train accurate models for complex tasks such as image classification and computer vision. Due to limits in data privacy regulations and communication bandwidth, it is usually infeasible to transmit and store all training data at a central location. To address this problem, <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL) has emerged as a promising approach of distributed model training from decentralized data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In a typical FL system, data is collected by client devices (e.g., cameras) at the network edge; the training process includes local model updates using each client’s own data and the fusion of all clients’ models typically through a server. In this way, the raw data remains local in clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Client devices in FL are usually much more resource-constrained than server machines in a datacenter, in terms of computation power, communication bandwidth, memory and storage size, etc. Training DNNs that can include over millions of parameters (weights) on such resource-limited edge devices can take prohibitively long and consume a large amount of energy.
Therefore, a natural question is: <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">how can we perform FL efficiently so that a model is trained within a reasonable amount of time and energy?</em></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some progress has been made towards this direction recently using model/gradient compression techniques, where instead of training the original model with full parameter vector, either a small model is extracted from the original model for training or a compressed parameter vector (or its gradient) is transmitted in the fusion stage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, the former approach may reduce the accuracy of the final model in undesirable ways, whereas the latter approach only reduces the communication overhead and does not generate a small model for efficient computation. Furthermore, how to adapt the compressed model size for the most efficient training remains a largely unexplored area, which is a challenging problem due to unpredictable training dynamics and the need of obtaining a good solution in a short time with minimal overhead.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome these problems, we propose a new FL paradigm called <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">PruneFL</em>, which includes <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">adaptive and distributed parameter pruning</em> as part of the FL procedure.
We make the following key contributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Distributed pruning.</span> PruneFL includes initial pruning at a selected client followed by further distributed pruning that is intertwined with the standard FL procedure. Our experimental results show that this method outperforms alternative approaches that either prunes at a single client only or directly involves multiple FL clients for pruning, especially when the clients have heterogeneous data statistics and computational power.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Adaptive pruning.</span> PruneFL continuously “tracks” a model that is small enough for efficient transmission and computation with low memory footprint, while maintaining useful connections and their parameters so that the model converges to a similar accuracy as the original model. The importance of model parameters evolves during training, so our method continuously updates which parameters to keep and the corresponding model size. The update follows an objective of minimizing the time of reaching intermediate and final loss values. Each FL round operates on a small pruned model, which is efficient. A small model is also obtained at any time during and after the FL process for efficient inference on edge devices, which is a lottery ticket <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> of the original model as we show experimentally.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Neural network pruning.</span>
To reduce the complexity of neural network models, different ways of parameter pruning were proposed in the literature. Early work considered approximation using second-order Taylor expansion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, the computation of Hessian matrix has high complexity which is infeasible for modern DNNs. In recent years, magnitude-based pruning has become popular <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where parameters with small enough magnitudes are removed from the network. A finding that suggests a network that is pruned by magnitude consists of an optimal substructure of the original network, known as “lottery ticket hypothesis”, was presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. It shows that directly training the pruned network can reach a similar accuracy as pruning a pre-trained original network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the above approaches that train until convergence before the next pruning step, there are iterative pruning methods where the model is pruned after every few steps of training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. There are also one-shot pruning approaches including SynFlow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> that prunes the model at model initialization (before training), and SNIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> that prunes the model using first training round’s gradient information. A dynamic pruning approach that allows the network to grow and shrink during training was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Besides these unstructured pruning methods, structured pruning was also studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which, however, often requires specific network architectures and does not conform to the lottery ticket hypothesis. The lottery ticket is useful for retraining a pruned model on a different yet similar dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The use of pruning for efficient model training was discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, where the optimal choice of pruning rate (or final model size) remained unstudied.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These existing pruning techniques consider the centralized setting with full access to training data, which is fundamentally different from our PruneFL that works with decentralized datasets at local clients. Furthermore, the automatic adaptation of model size has not been studied before.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Efficient federated learning.</span>
The first FL method is known as federated averaging (<span id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text">FedAvg</span>) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, where each “round” of training includes multiple local gradient computation steps on each client’s local data, followed by a parameter averaging step through a server. This method can be shown to converge in various settings including when the data at different clients are non-identically distributed (non-IID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the communication efficiency of FL, methods for optimizing the communication frequency were studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. An approach of parameter averaging using structured, sketched, and quantized updates was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which belongs to the broader area of gradient compression/sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. These techniques usually consider a fixed degree of sparsity or compression that needs to be configured as a hyperparameter. An online learning approach that determines a near-optimal gradient sparsity was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which includes exploration steps that may slow down the training initially. This body of work does not address computation efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce both communication and computation costs, efficient FL techniques using lossy compression and dropout were developed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, where the final model still has the original size and hence providing no benefit for efficient inference after the model is trained.
Moreover, because the main goal of pruning is to remove less important weights from the model, it is orthogonal to other acceleration methods such as quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, low-rank decomposition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, etc., and pruning can be applied together with these other methods. In addition, since our approach considers acceleration for both training and inference, methods that accelerate inference only, e.g., knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, runtime neural pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>,
and DNN partitioning and offloading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, do not serve our purpose. There are other distributed training methods, such as split learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, which are beyond our scope since we focus on FL in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, most existing studies on FL are based on simulation. Only a few recent papers considered implementation on real embedded devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, but they do not include parameter pruning.</p>

<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Novelty of our work.</span> The uniqueness of PruneFL is that we jointly address communication and computation efficiency for both training and inference phases, by extending FedAvg with minimal extra overhead. Our two-stage distributed pruning method is designed to address both data (statistical) and device (system) heterogeneity including non-IID data distribution.
Our adaptive pruning method is uniquely based on gradient information, which does not require sharing clients’ local data, so that existing privacy preservation and secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> methods for FL can be directly applied to the gradient.

In the iterative training and pruning approaches for the centralized machine learning setting, the model is first trained using SGD for a given number of iterations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Then, a certain percentage (referred to as the pruning rate) of weights that have smallest absolute values within each layer is removed (set to zero). This training and pruning process is repeated until a desired model size is reached. The benefit of this approach is that the training and pruning occurs at the same time, so that a trained model with a desired (small) size can be obtained in the end. However, existing pruning techniques require the availability of training data at a central location, which is not applicable to FL.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed PruneFL approach includes two stages: initial pruning at a selected client and further pruning involving both the server and clients during the FL process. The initial pruning can be done with biased data at a single client that has a relatively high computational capability, and the further pruning stage will “remove” the bias and refine the model. We use <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adaptive pruning</span> in both stages. The illustration of the overall procedure is presented in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II Related Work ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

Before FL starts, the system selects a single client to prune the model using its local data. This is important for two reasons. First, it allows us to start the FL process with a small model, which can significantly reduce the computation and communication time of each FL round. Second, when clients have heterogeneous computational capabilities, the selected client for initial pruning can be one that is powerful and trusted, so that the time required for initial pruning is short. We apply the adaptive pruning procedure that we describe in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Adaptive Pruning ‣ IV PruneFL ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a>, where we adjust the original model iteratively while training the model on the selected client’s local dataset, until the model size remains almost unchanged.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Further pruning during FL process.</span>
The model produced by initial pruning may not be optimal, because it is obtained based on data at a single client. However, it is a good starting point for the FL process involving all clients.
During FL, we perform further adaptive pruning together with the standard FedAvg procedure, where the model can either grow or shrink depending on which way makes the training most efficient. In this stage, data from all participating clients are involved.</p>

Hence, we also refer to such pruning operations as <em id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">reconfiguration</em>. We reconfigure the model at a given interval of multiple iterations. For initial pruning, the reconfiguration interval can be any number of local iterations at the selected client. For further pruning, reconfiguration is done at the server after receiving parameter updates from clients (i.e., at the boundary between two rounds), and the reconfiguration interval in this case is always an integer multiple of the number of iterations (i.e., <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="I" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">I</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">I</annotation></semantics></math>) in each round.</p>

This convergence result shows that the gradient components corresponding to the remaining (i.e., not pruned) parameters vanishes over time, which suggests that we will get a “stable” parameter vector in the end, because when the gradient norm is small, the change of parameters in each iteration is also small. In addition to gradient convergence on the subspace after pruning as suggested in Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem2" title="Theorem 2. ‣ IV-B Adaptive Pruning ‣ IV PruneFL ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, our experiments show that our pruned model also converges to an accuracy close to that of the full-sized model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As of today, well-known machine learning frameworks have limited support of sparse matrix computation. For instance, in PyTorch version 1.6.0, the persistent storage of a matrix in sparse form takes <math id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="5\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><mn id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">5</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">5\times</annotation></semantics></math> space compared to its dense form; the computations on sparse matrices are slow; and sparse matrices are not supported for the kernels in convolutional layers, etc. To benefit from using sparse matrices in real systems, we extend the PyTorch library by implementing a more efficient sparse storage, and the support for sparse convolutional kernels. We only partially improve backward passes due to implementation limitations (more details in Appendix <a href="#A0.SS3.SSS2" title="-C2 Gradient Computation ‣ -C PruneFL details ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">-C</span>2</span></a>). This problem, however, can be improved in the future by implementing and further optimizing efficient sparse matrix multiplication on low-level software, as well as developing specific hardware for this purpose. Nevertheless, the novelty in our implementation is that we use sparse matrices in both fully-connected and convolutional layers in the pruned model.</p>

We see that PruneFL outperforms conventional FL by a significant margin.
Since the prototype and simulation results match closely, we present the simulation results in subsequent experiments due to their excessive training time on the prototype system.</p>

In Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we compare the test accuracy vs. time results for all datasets, models, and baselines. Clearly, PruneFL demonstrates a consistent advantage on training speed over baselines. Moreover, PruneFL always converges to similar accuracy achieved by conventional FL (see Appendix <a href="#A0.SS4.SSS3" title="-D3 Convergence Accuracy Results for All Experiments ‣ -D Additional Experimental Results ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">-D</span>3</span></a>). Other methods may have suboptimal performance, e.g., SNIP does not converge to conventional FL’s accuracy with CIFAR-10. We also observe that some approaches such as online learning and SynFlow in Fig. <a href="#S6.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a> always stay at the random guess accuracy.

Although we observe that the training time on Raspberry Pis is relatively consistent across different models and tasks, there are still factors that can affect the training time (e.g., environment temperature). To further validate our approach’s advantage on accelerating training, we present the results on test accuracy vs. accumulated FLOPs per client for FEMNIST in Fig. <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI-B Training Cost Reduction ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. We find that this result shares the same characteristics with Fig. <a href="#S6.F5.sf0" title="In Figure 5 ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5()</span></a> in terms of acceleration (we present only one set of results here due to the similarity).</p>

It shows that the model obtained from the initial pruning stage does not converge to the optimal accuracy, and only performing further pruning without initial pruning results in a slower learning speed. PruneFL with both stages avoids drawbacks from methods that includes only one stage. Furthermore, the model obtained from initial pruning is not a lottery ticket of the original model, while PruneFL with only further pruning or both pruning stages find a lottery ticket.</p>

Since there is no notion of “round” in the initial pruning stage, we consider five local iterations in this stage as one round, which is consistent with our FL setting. Conventional FL always keeps the full model size. The model sizes provided by online learning is unstable. It fluctuates in initial rounds due to its exploration. SNIP and SynFlow prune the initial model to the target size in a one-shot manner at the beginning of training. Iterative pruning gradually reduces the model size until reaching the target.
We notice that PruneFL also discovers the degree of overparameterization. Empirically, Conv-2, an overparameterized model for FEMNIST, converges to a small density (<math id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="13.4\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">13.4</mn><mo id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">13.4</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.p1.2.m2.1c">13.4\%</annotation></semantics></math>), while ResNet-18, an underparameterized model for ImageNet-100, converges to a density of around <math id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="67.7\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">67.7</mn><mo id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">67.7</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.p1.3.m3.1c">67.7\%</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

Taking CIFAR-10 on VGG-11 as an example, the densities of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers at convergence are listed in Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ VI-F Relative Importance Between Layers ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Model Pruning Enables Efficient Federated Learning on Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> in a sequential manner. We observe that the input and output layers are not pruned to a low density, indicating that they are relatively important in the neural network architectures. This also agrees with the pruning scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, where the authors empirically set the pruning rate of the output layer to a small percentage or even to zero. Some large convolutional layers, such as the last two convolutional layers in VGG-11, are identified as redundant, and thus have small densities at convergence.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have proposed PruneFL for FL in edge/mobile computing environments, where the goal is to effectively reduce the size of neural networks so that resource-limited clients can train them within a short time.
Our PruneFL method includes initial and further pruning stages, which improves the performance compared to only having a single stage.
PruneFL also includes a low-complexity adaptive pruning method for efficient FL, which finds a desired model size that can achieve a similar prediction accuracy as the original model but with much less time. Our experiments on Raspberry Pi devices confirm that we improve the cost-efficiency of FL while
obtaining a lottery ticket.
Our method can be applied together with other compression techniques, such as quantization, to further reduce the communication overhead.</p>

There are two advantages: (i) if the task is easy, reconfiguration starts early, which results in early model size decrease that saves training time; and (ii) it also avoids pruning the model too early when the prediction is still close to random guess, meaning the parameter values are still in the random initialization stage. In the further pruning stage, reconfiguration happens periodically with a fixed interval.</p>

In both reconfiguration and non-reconfiguration rounds, the importance measure is summed locally after every local update, until the sum is sent to the server in the next reconfiguration round. Note that in non-reconfiguration rounds, only the remaining model parameters are used in computation and exchanged between server and clients. Since the parameter set is fixed in non-reconfiguration rounds, only the <span id="A0.SS3.SSS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">values</span> of the parameters need to be exchanged between the server and clients, which incurs no extra communication cost.
