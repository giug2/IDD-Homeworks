<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Structured Visual Content (SVC) such as graphs, flow charts, or the like are used by authors to illustrate various concepts. While such depictions allow the average reader to better understand the contents, images containing SVCs are typically not machine-readable. This, in turn, not only hinders automated knowledge aggregation, but also the perception of displayed information for visually impaired people.
In this work, we propose a synthetic dataset, containing SVCs in the form of images as well as ground truths. We show the usage of this dataset by an application that automatically extracts a graph representation from an SVC image. This is done by training a model via common supervised learning methods.
As there currently exist no large-scale public datasets for the detailed analysis of SVC, we propose the Synthetic SVC (SSVC) dataset comprising 12,000 images with respective bounding box annotations and detailed graph representations. Our dataset enables the development of strong models for the interpretation of SVCs while skipping the time-consuming dense data annotation.</span></p>
<p id="id4.id2" class="ltx_p"><span id="id4.id2.1" class="ltx_text">We evaluate our model on both synthetic and manually annotated data and show the transferability of synthetic to real via various metrics, given the presented application.
Here, we evaluate that this proof of concept is possible to some extend and lay down a solid baseline for this task.
We discuss the limitations of our approach for further improvements.
Our utilized metrics can be used as a tool for future comparisons in this domain.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We observe underlying similarities between various types of SVC. Nodes relating to objects are typically represented by geometrical structures such as boxes, ovals, etc. in varying forms whereas their relationships are displayed via different types of arrows. Despite building upon simple structures, highly complex graphs can become too difficult to interpret for handcrafted methods. To combat this issue, we propose the use of a synthetic dataset in which we artificially generate random visual graphs to train deep learning methods for the detection of nodes and their relationships. Our approach can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent works in the field of document analysis seem to focus on one of two different problems. On the one hand, the area of text recognition aims to identify text in images and transform it to machine understandable text representations. This is for example done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> by methods of machine learning. More advanced versions even try to recognize handwritten mathematical formulas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or printed formulas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, the focus is set on the recognition of document structures, often via segmentation. Examples are the page segmentation of lecture slide content <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or the detection and segmentation of tables <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In contrast to existing literature, we combine both text recognition and content localization. Thus, after the identification of nodes and edges we utilize text recognition models to deal with their content. We use this to build the graph representation of the SVC.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In regards to our use case, only little work has been done on the recognition of SVC in general. Existent research focuses on similar topics, where the detection of structure in visuals is important.
The recognition of mathematical formulas from text often uses a tree based structure to capture the structure and relation of different components within the formula <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Some work focuses on graph structures and the associated construction of metrics. Le <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> focuses on the recognition of subgraphs in graph representations of comic book images with state of the art methods and also addresses the availability of ground truth datasets. Possibilities of calculating the edit distance of graphs efficiently are considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
More closely related to our definition of SVC are the following related works.
Building upon the real-world dataset (DISKNET), Scharfenberger <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> train a model for the extraction of such SVC. They are however limited by the low number of manually labeled training data available for their context. Further, their research still lacks in detecting node text content and in detection of edges and assigning the weights and their text.
Awal <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> try to extract a graph-like structure from hand drawn flow charts. This separates the task into two parts. Recognizing the elements that represent the graphical components and extracting the text itself.
Auer <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> on the other hand do not consider text and concentrate on recognizing limited graph structures. Those consist only of fully colored circular nodes and bidirectional straight edges. Their work uses a multi-step procedure with pre-processing, segmentation, topology recognition, and post-processing, while mainly using conventional computer vision methods and pixel based operations.
Vasudevan <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> go one step further, their goal is to directly extract the knowledge from flow charts without recognizing an explicit graph structure. Similarly, Wu <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> want to generate code from given flow charts. Both works make strict assumptions about the given images and focus strictly on their use case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, our approach aims at SVC more in general and does not demand a certain type of graph structure. Therefore, we strive to detect basic elements such as nodes and their content, as well as different types of edges and their weights. The final graph representation should be purely descriptive, without being specialized for any certain use case. Further, we alleviate the issue of little available, ground-truth annotated data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> by combining manually labeled with synthetic data.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The creation of SVCs in this work is subject to various targets. We generate images of different sizes that present nodes and edges connecting them. Furthermore, groupings of nodes are possible and random text fields are included in these images. In addition, different design choices are applied to these objects, to increase the possible variations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A node can be a rectangle or an ellipse and displays text. Multiple nodes can be framed by a rectangular grouping. Each node can be connected to one or multiple other nodes or to a grouping by an edge, but it does not have to. A grouping itself can only be connected to other nodes outside, but not to nodes within itself. An edge can be a straight line or an angled one, while being uni-directional or bi-directional. A variation of these edges is striped and the arrow tips can be filled or just line-work. Each edge has a numerical weight, presented by a text near the line, sometimes with an additional white background, which could overlap with the edge itself. All variations mentioned are distributed uniformly. Furthermore, different text sizes are used in these images, as well as different line widths and drawing strategies such as anti-aliasing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In our implementation, we used a grid structure to place the objects. At a random position within each cell there may either be a node, a background text or nothing. Textual content is chosen from a list <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Then a number of edges is placed between the nodes, but no connection is made twice, also avoiding collisions with nodes. Edge weights between 0 and 1 are annotated as well. Just as the variations in design, all positional decisions are afflicted by randomness. The size of the image, grid structure and nodes are all chosen randomly, as well as the number of nodes, edges and other elements. An example of such an SVC can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>a.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Together with these images, we generate ground truth data for all tasks.
For the object detection, bounding boxes are stored for the objects and separately for text segments.
Nodes of all variations and groupings are labeled “node”, while edges are differentiated by their start and end point within a bounding box. In our case these can be in two opposing corners (diagonal edges) or at two opposing side centers (horizontal and vertical edges).
This leads to 8 different edge types as seen in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III Synthetic Structured Visual Content ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
To also represent bidirectional edges, which have two end points, we add further 4 classes in the same way.
Since we encountered problems with very small bounding boxes and under represented classes, we chose to label diagonal edges, that fall into +/-2.5 degrees of 0/90/180/270 degrees with the closest horizontal or vertical label.
We save bounding boxes for all texts within a node, besides an edge or in the background according to their purpose: “node”, “edge”, or “plain”.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For graph recognition tasks, we directly create a document that describes the generated graph structure. In this document, there is a list of all nodes, specifying their id, content and potential sub nodes. If a node has a sub node it is considered a grouping. Likewise, a list of all edges is defined with an id, weight, source-node and target-node id and information regarding the arrow tips for each edge.</p>

<div id="S3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">These images contain a total amount of 167,685 objects, 94,701 of them are nodes and 72,984 are edges. A detailed description of the edges and their respective classes is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III Synthetic Structured Visual Content ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
Diagonal edges are much more likely than horizontal or vertical edges. Furthermore, in our implementation, an edge has a 20% chance to be bi-directional. This is visible in the statistics, as for example #bl2tr + #tr2bl <math id="S3.p7.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\approx" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p7.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S3.p7.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml">≈</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p7.1.m1.1b"><approx id="S3.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p7.1.m1.1.1"></approx></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p7.1.m1.1c">\approx</annotation></semantics></math> 4 * #bi_tl2br.
The naming of the edge classes represent their orientation within their bounding box. For example, “tl2br” means “top-left to bottom-right”, likewise “l2r” means “left to right” referring to a horizontal edge pointing right (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III Synthetic Structured Visual Content ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).
Furthermore, a distinction is made between bi-directional and unidirectional edges. We display an exemplary synthetic image as well as a real-world image from the DISKNET dataset in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

The first receives an image and is supposed to detect all structural components such as nodes and edges. This is done via common object detection methods, utilizing the generated bounding box annotations.
In parallel, text recognition methods are applied, which extract the textual content from the image together with a position.
The next step uses the detected objects and reconstructs their structural relation by means of nearest neighbour approaches and heuristics.
Here, the goal is to create a graph structure describing the connection between nodes by the different edges and the grouping relations.
After that, the extracted textual information are mapped to their matching nodes and edges and added to the final graph representation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS0.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We used a pretrained version of the YOLOv5 model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> in its large configuration and fine tuned it on the training set of 8.400 images. We refrain from using flipping in the data augmentation step, as this would conflict with our definition of edge orientations. Furthermore, the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold in training and detection should be set to zero, as overlapping bounding boxes are normal in this application. The result of this step are bounding boxes for each image, describing the position of nodes and different types of edges. However, we lose some information. By describing edges only via a bounding box and general direction, the exact course of an edge, is lost. While this may lead to problems when assigning the text to the edges it can be improved in the future.</p>

Afterwards, the nodes are connected via edges. For this, the <span id="S4.SS0.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">connection points</span> are searched for an edge on its bounding box.
The connection points represent the start and end points of an edge, which are derived by the edge direction class. For a diagonal or angled edge these points are in the corner of a bounding box, for a horizontal or vertical edge, they are on the center of a side.
For each connection point the next adjacent node is searched and connected to the edge.
In the end, all elements are connected accordingly and we have created a graph structure, that contains all previously detected objects.</p>

After the graph structure has been created, the texts have to be assigned to the corresponding elements in the graph.
First, the overlap to the node boxes is determined for each text bounding box. If the overlap is large enough, the text is considered as a part of the node and added to it.
The remaining texts must therefore belong to edges, or have been placed freely in the image.
To assign the edges, all possible edge bounding boxes are determined for each text bounding box, based on their overlap.
Then the most probable edge bounding box for the text is determined, based on all possible courses of an edge within its bounding box. All remaining texts are assumed to be background texts and will not be added to the graph representation.</p>

The nodes and the most common edge types are detected very well by the model, while the less common types are recognized not as good. The comparison to the real world data set however shows, that those edge types are also less common there or not even present at all.
As seen in the table, horizontal and vertical edges pose a much harder problem for the object detection than the diagonal edges. This can be due to their generally smaller bounding box.
After manual evaluation we noticed, that most errors do not come from missed detections but from wrong classifications. This means that an edge from bottom to top is detected as an edge from bottom left to top right. It can be argued that such an error is less bad than a complete miss, since the graph reconstruction can still work correctly in those situations (see Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Step 2 ‣ IV-3 Create Graph Representation ‣ IV Methodology ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>).</p>

The normalized isomorphic error is calculated in two versions, where the first one includes wrong directions of the edges in the error, while the second does not and only measures the undirected graph.
The nodes are again the easiest part and are recognised almost perfectly on average even in the real world dataset.
Edges however are more difficult, while the detection of their direction is a big part of their error.
Furthermore, the mapping between edges of the ground truth and the detection results is very difficult.
In this implementation, we used heuristics to approximate a one to one mapping, which obviously can lead to problems.
This also means that one wrong assignment of an edge to a node can lead to two errors, as it counts towards a missing edge on the correct node and a false edge on that node.
Nevertheless, in multiple cases the graph reconstruction was perfect and able to create the wanted graph representation.

We observe, that the text recognition is on average better in the real world data set than in the synthetic data set.
Notice, that the error could be high, when a node is not detected, and therefore its text is falsely mapped. This influence is higher if there are only few nodes in the image.
The text recognition however is not the main task of our work and it is modular and easy exchangeable.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing the results of our evaluation is very difficult because there are no comparable works on this task. Existing works address problems such as recognising structures and assigning it to different classes, as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, because of the different task they are not suitable for comparison.
The evaluation shows that nodes themselves can be detected very confidently, while edges pose some problems. In general, horizontal or vertical edges are harder than diagonal edges, which can be due to their smaller bounding box size, the fact that they are less common in the dataset or due to the observation, that they are not always missed but incorrectly classified. It can be argued, that an edge from left to right which is detected as an edge from bottom left to top right is less bad than a complete miss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another problem with the detection of edges is their direction (c.f. Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table II ‣ V-C Results ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>). Apparently the arrow heads are too small to be confidently detected.
In the generation, some problems producing ambiguous graphs are not excluded, since they also represent existing challenges. In Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-C Results ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> two examples of such real world difficulties are shown. Furthermore, we show that a model is capable of generalizing over a large dataset, can extract the core structures of SVCs and apply them, also to maybe less complex SVCs. Therefore it is no problem, if the training data is sometimes a bit harder than the later real world use case. We show further examples in the supplementary material.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In our synthetic to real approach we can divide the limitations into two categories. One deals with the influence of the synthetic dataset. The second focuses on the applied method.</p>

<div id="S6.SS0.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS0.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The synthetic dataset provides first good approaches to generate different graphs. However, there are many variations that can be added to this dataset. For example, round edges and further edge types are possible, together with additional class labels representing their directions. Also, multiple nested groupings are missing and more shapes of nodes would be a useful extension. The horizontal as well as the vertical edges seem to be underrepresented in the dataset, which leads to a worse recognition results of these.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS0.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS0.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, the dataset does not contain any additional information, such as legends. These would be an interesting special case, since they often show elements of the graph without having a semantic meaning for the graph itself.
In general, our synthetic set is randomly generated. Therefore, the layouts and structures are also random in contrast to diagrams created by humans. This results in the entire diagram being distributed much more evenly in the image than it is often the case in reality. In reality, you often find converging structures that have many edges running up to each other. Such structures are underrepresented in the training set.
For further improvements, it would be interesting to extend the synthetic dataset to be able to represent even more real world graphs.</p>

<div id="S6.SS0.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS0.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of our main methodological limitation is the heuristic assignment of text to edges. This constraint originates in the problem, that we only work with bounding boxes of edges and lost the information about their exact path. Additionally, real world images do not follow any rule on how to assign weights to edges and therefore it is difficult to design a general heuristic. Similarly, our nodes are detected and processed only by their bounding boxes too. Even though this did not lead to any problems now, it maybe would be better to switch from an object detection via bounding boxes to segmentation masks, especially for better edge detection.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By storing the graph representation of SVC, the contained information within the image can be more easily accessed and utilized by other processes.
The automated parsing of such graph structures from SVC, however, is a challenging problem. To approach this, we have generated a synthetic automatically generated dataset which shares structures with its real counterpart. Through the automated dataset generation we gather annotations required for the training of deep learning models and enable tasks such as the parsing of graph structures. For the latter, our method matches detected nodes and edges with their respective captions based on spatial coordinates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We show promising results not only on the synthetic data but also on real world examples. Furthermore, we delineate potential limitations of our approach and, thereby, demonstrate the feasibility of our approach (<span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span> generating synthetic data, training on the aforementioned, applying the model on real world data) for SVC. Our approach allows for easily scalable training of performant models with only little manual annotation effort for, <span id="S7.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, real world data. The <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jN1pJJ" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">dataset</a> is publicly available.
We expect that our work will further enable easier automated analysis of SVC.</p>
