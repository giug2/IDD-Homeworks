<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Clustering is an important branch of unsupervised learning. The field attempts to uncover hidden structure within data sets. This ambiguous endeavor poses multiple challenges. It is usually not clear <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">what</span> a typical cluster looks like, nor <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how many</span> clusters a data set contains. In addition, real-world data often exhibits hierarchical structure. Each cluster may contain sub-clusters, raising the possibility of multiple valid clusterings at different resolutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This fuzziness can cause headaches for methodologists. When developing a new algorithm for cluster analysis, it is difficult to find appropriate data for testing. One approach is to use data sets from multi-class classification and erase the labels. This practice has limitations since class labels in classification tasks can depend strongly on individual variables, at the expense of the overall structure in the data. Another approach is to use initially unlabeled data that has been annotated by a domain expert. This strategy seems reasonable, though it is not always scalable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another possibility is to generate synthetic data on a computer. Surprisingly, in the field of cluster analysis such data possesses several advantages over real data. These include objectivity, manipulability, and fungibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">First, synthetic data is objective because it is based on mathematical models for data sets with clusters. Such models clarify <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">what</span> a cluster is and <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how many</span> clusters a data set contains. In addition, a model makes clear how many levels of hierarchy are present in the data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Second, synthetic data is manipulable because the user can change its properties. Such interventions enable computational experiments. For example, increasing the degree of overlap between clusters allows us to determine how a clustering algorithm performs under challenging conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Third, synthetic data should be fungible. The dictionary defines this word as meaning “replaceable by another identical item.” What we mean is that any individual synthetic data set should be freely replaceable with a fresh data set that has similar overall characteristics. In other words, fungibility requires the ability to sample from the data-generating probability distribution. In the context of synthetic data with clusters, fresh data sets should have new cluster locations and shapes. Consequently, “handcrafted” synthetic data with manually selected cluster locations is not fungible. Fungible synthetic data promotes reproducibility because researchers can share the data-generating probability distributions underlying benchmarks and computational experiments. Our data generator <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">repliclust</span> achieves fungibility by stochastically modeling the geometric structure of a clustered data set, including cluster shapes, locations, sample sizes, and distributions.</p>

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In the next section, we describe prior work on synthetic data for cluster analysis.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.1 </span>Related Work</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most existing data generators for cluster analysis use probabilistic mixture models to generate blob-like ellipsoidal clusters. Perhaps the most important requirement of such generators is the ability to effectively control the separation between clusters while allowing diverse cluster shapes (ellipsoids of varying sizes, eccentricities, and orientations) within a single data set. This requirement often presents a trade-off, as the coexistence of diverse cluster shapes makes it more difficult to manage overlap between clusters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Different generators navigate this trade-off differently. The HAWKS generator of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shand et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> uses a genetic algorithm to synthesize data sets of a desired <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">silhouette width</span>. This classical metric goes back to the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rousseeuw (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite> and measures the degree of clustering in a data set. High values indicate well-separated clusters, whereas low levels indicate overlap between clusters. The silhouette width presents a promising difficulty scale for benchmarking clustering algorithms, as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shand et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> discuss. However, its numerical values are difficult to interpret geometrically. In addition, HAWKS’ focus on optimizing the silhouette width makes it lose geometric flexibility. Whereas our method controls cluster shape independently of cluster separation, HAWKS automatically “evolves” cluster means and covariance matrices in order to tune the silhouette width. At a fixed level of cluster separation, the user cannot exert much control over the shapes of clusters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The generator of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Qiu and Joe (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006a</a>)</cite> introduces a similar dependence between cluster separation and shape. Their method controls overlap between clusters via a separation index. This quantity, proposed by the same authors, measures the spatial extent of clusters by their extreme quantiles along a one-dimensional projection. The method identifies the direction that best separates two clusters and measures separation along it. Placement of cluster centers takes place deterministically. The generator locates new centers at the vertices of axis-aligned regular simplices translated along the first coordinate axis. To make sufficient room for larger clusters, the method lengthens edges of the simplicial scaffold until all clusters are sufficiently well-separated. To attain a desired separation index exactly, the generator iteratively shrinks the cluster most separated from the others. Hence, it is not possible to control cluster volume without affecting cluster separation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The generator MDCGen of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Iglesias et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> presents yet another approach to controlling overlap between clusters. Their method initially places cluster centers at the vertices of a rectangular grid. Later on, the algorithm randomly translates cluster centers to make the overall layout less regular. To achieve a desired level of separation between clusters, the user must specify the grid resolution in relation to the cluster sizes. Unfortunately, an axis-aligned rectangular grid is not naturally adapted to the geometry of oblong ellipsoidal clusters at random orientations. While it is possible for obliquely-oriented ellipsoids to fit inside (large) axis-aligned boxes, this approach does not represent their spatial outlines effectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Other cluster generators include work by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pei and Zaïane (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Handl and Knowles (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Schubert and Zimek (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. These generators are compelling early contributions but, compared with other methods, appear limited today. The generator of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pei and Zaïane (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite> samples data sets with a user-specified complexity but can only create two-dimensional data sets. The “Gaussian” and “Ellipsoid” generators proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Handl and Knowles (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite> generate multivariate Gaussian and ellipsoidal clusters subject to significant restrictions on cluster shapes and overlaps. For example, the “Gaussian” generator ties cluster shape (spherical vs oblong) to the dimensionality, rather than letting the user control it. By contrast, the “Ellipsoid” generator creates oblong clusters of varying eccentricities, but only with circular cross-sections. Neither generator confers the ability to control cluster volume independently of shape. In addition, both generators minimize overlap between clusters, rather than letting the user specify a desired level of overlap.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The ELKI data mining toolkit by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Schubert and Zimek (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> contains an XML-based data generator capable of synthesizing data sets with clusters. However, this generator is not directly comparable to our method, as the user must manually configure all cluster parameters, including the locations of the centers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Data generation with <span id="S1.SS1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">repliclust</span> (headquartered at <a target="_blank" href="https://repliclust.org" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href ltx_font_typewriter">repliclust.org</a>) differs from existing approaches in three important ways. First, our generator solicits user input in the form of high-level geometric archetypes. Each archetype acts as a random sampler for probabilistic mixture models, allowing the user to generate similar but different synthetic data sets. Second, we define pairwise cluster overlap in terms of the error rate of the best linear classifier, for which a good approximation is available when clusters are normally distributed. The resulting metric ties overlap between clusters to the expected clustering performance, while naturally adapting to discrepancies in cluster shapes and orientations. Third, our software decomposes data generation into four distinct steps: generating cluster shapes, placing cluster centers, choosing the number of data points for each cluster, and assigning cluster-specific probability distributions. This approach controls different geometric attributes independently from each other, maximizing user control while allowing researchers to adapt the implementation of individual steps without affecting others.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our data generator <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">repliclust</span> is based on data set archetypes. A <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data set archetype</span> is a high-level description of the overall geometry of a data set with clusters. For example, the class of all data sets with “three oblong and slightly overlapping clusters in two dimensions with some class imbalance” is a data set archetype.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When generating synthetic data with <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">repliclust</span>, individual data sets are i.i.d. samples from probabilistic mixture models. An <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Archetype</span> object enables random sampling of probabilistic mixture models that meet the archetype’s description. Thus, the user can generate similar but distinct data sets at will. Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Overview ‣ repliclust: Synthetic Data for Cluster Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> illustrates this paradigm for synthetic data generation.

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Generating synthetic data using geometric archetypes has several advantages. First, benchmarks of new algorithms will become more reliable. When a researcher creates synthetic data sets by hand to test a new algorithm, generating each new data set takes substantial effort. Thus, it is tempting to leave the data unchanged while tweaking the algorithm, which incurs an optimistic bias in the test results. Our data generator removes the incentive for tolerating this bias because it makes generating new synthetic data effortless.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.3" class="ltx_p">Second, using data set archetypes makes benchmarks more reproducible. When researchers use one-off methods to generate synthetic data, each benchmark is unique and cannot be directly compared to another benchmark. By contrast, imagine testing a new algorithm on 1,000 synthetic data sets drawn from archetype <math id="S2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{A}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒜</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝒜</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p4.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{A}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The user specifies an <span id="S4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Archetype</span> object by selecting high-level parameters determining geometric attributes such as 1) the number of clusters and dimensionality of the data, 2) the typical shape of a cluster and its expected variation within a data set, 3) the degree of overlap between clusters, 4) the imbalance in the number of data points per cluster, and 5) the possible probability distributions for each cluster. There are different ways to parameterize such attributes.

For example, the aspect ratio of a cluster measures how elongated it is. On the one hand, it is a max-min ratio in its own right, since it equals the ratio of the lengths of the longest cluster axis to the shortest. On the other hand, it is also subject to control through max-min sampling. The parameter <span id="S4.p3.4.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">aspect_ref</span> sets the typical aspect ratio among all clusters in a data set, while <span id="S4.p3.4.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">aspect_maxmin</span> sets the ratio of the highest to the lowest aspect ratio.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Managing the degree of overlaps between clusters is one of the most important tasks of a cluster generator. For example, in benchmarks of clustering algorithms, synthetic data sets with significant overlap between clusters make it possible to test a new algorithm on challenging data sets. In <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">repliclust</span>, we define overlap between two clusters in terms of the irreducible error rate when classifying a new data point as belonging to one of the clusters.</p>

It requires thinking of clusters as multivariate probability distributions. This approach seems reasonable since many clustering algorithms implicitly define probabilistic models. For example, the popular K-Means algorithm is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of classifying each data point as a sample from one of <math id="S5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> distinct multivariate normal distributions (with <span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a priori</span> unknown means). Thus, measuring cluster overlap in terms of irreducible classification error guarantees that, as cluster overlap increases, K-Means performs worse. This desirable relationship suggests that our definition of cluster overlap partly reflects the intrinsic difficulty of a clustering problem.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents <span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">repliclust</span>, a synthetic data generator for cluster analysis. Our main contribution is to introduce data set archetypes. To implement this idea, we introduced several practical innovations. For example, we use max-min parameters to define the overall geometric characteristics of a data set with clusters. In addition, we define cluster overlap based on minimax classification error (along with useful approximations) and encode this definition in a loss function. Finally, <span id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">repliclust</span> uses a flexible definition of probabilistic mixture models, giving the user more control over data geometry than comparable software.</p>

Just like any other synthetic data, it is <span id="S8.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">objective</span> because the cluster identity of each data point is unambiguous, and <span id="S8.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">manipulable</span> because the user can change individual geometric attributes while leaving others constant. However, it is also <span id="S8.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fungible</span>, in the sense that sampling from a data-generating probability distribution makes individual data sets freely replaceable. This last quality bestows the gift of nearly unlimited statistical power. In our benchmark between K-Means and Gaussian mixture models, we could sample as many i.i.d. data sets from each archetype as we wished, subject only to (moderate) computational limitations.</p>
