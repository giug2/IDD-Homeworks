<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic datasets are often presented as a silver-bullet solution to the problem of privacy-preserving data publishing. However, for many applications, synthetic data has been shown to have limited utility when used to train predictive models. One promising potential application of these data is in the exploratory phase of the machine learning workflow, which involves understanding, engineering and selecting features. This phase often involves considerable time, and depends on the availability of data. There would be substantial value in synthetic data that permitted these steps to be carried out while, for example, data access was being negotiated, or with fewer information governance restrictions. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the agreement between the feature importance obtained from raw and from synthetic data, on a range of artificially generated and real-world datasets (where feature importance represents how useful each feature is when predicting a the outcome). We employ two differentially-private methods to produce synthetic data, and apply various utility measures to quantify the agreement in feature importance as this varies with the level of privacy. Our results indicate that synthetic data can sometimes preserve several representations of the ranking of feature importance in simple settings but their performance is not consistent and depends upon a number of factors. Particular caution should be exercised in more nuanced real-world settings, where synthetic data can lead to differences in ranked feature importance that could alter key modelling decisions. This work has important implications for developing synthetic versions of highly sensitive data sets in fields such as finance and healthcare.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Access to high-quality data is a key concern of every data scientist
and machine-learning practitioner. When the use of a dataset is restricted, perhaps to respect the privacy of individuals, the ability to perform analyses on the data, share results, or publish the analysis for reproduction by others is often limited. Restrictions might also incur additional infrastructure costs. This is often the case when dealing with datasets in domains such as healthcare, finance, telecommunications and the public sector, where access is tightly controlled using secure compute environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hubbard
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Methods for producing synthetic data promise to address these limitations, by offering data that: (i) has the same form as the
original data, (ii) preserves certain properties of the underlying dataset (such that it is has a degree of utility for its intended
application), and (iii) limits inferences about individual records in
the original dataset (thus preserving the privacy of individuals).
The latter property means that synthetic datasets can often be treated
as less sensitive, if not completely publicly disclosable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The requirement of synthetic data to have the same form as the original data, (i), means that synthetic data can be
substituted for the data it intends to replace or augment. This requirement sets it
apart from other data intended for release, such as aggregate statistics or
coarsened data, as well as other products of modelling, such as trained generative models themselves. The property
(ii) we refer to generally as <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">utility</em>, and (iii) as <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">privacy</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we will also use the term <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">dummy data</em> to describe synthetic data that satisfies properties (i) and (iii) only, which are useful for developing and validating the mechanics of a data science pipeline (e.g. a machine learning pipeline), but not for other purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">One might expect there to be a trade-off between the privacy and utility of
synthesis methods. The data of highest utility
possible, by any reasonable measure, is the original data. A synthesis method
cannot add new information to the dataset, but it may obfuscate or fail to
capture relationships present in the original data, resulting in a reduction of utility. On
the other hand, releasing the original data offers no enhancement to privacy,
whereas releasing no data at all—or synthetic data generated with no
reference to the original data—offers maximal privacy, but for most purposes, low utility.
This <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">privacy–utility trade-off</em> is explored in a growing literature on the subject, see for example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Stadler

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Other anonymisation and pseudonimisation techniques (for example, aggregation, the addition of random noise to records, outlier removal, record permutation, subsampling) share a similar trade-off between utility and privacy, with various issues documented in the literature. For example, removing names and identifiers may not offer good privacy;
keeping the data at the level of individuals without aggregating is sometimes considered to be a high risk approach, for anything beyond a very small set of released features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Graham, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>; aggregation can destroy the utility of the data for many types of analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Drechsler and

et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>; many techniques offer no theoretical privacy guarantees; re-identification attacks on supposedly anonymised data have been successful <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Emam

During this time, initial exploratory analysis can proceed only using publicly available data or dummy data, both of which are typically not good replacements for real data. Synthetic data could potentially be a higher-quality replacement at this exploration stage, allowing for better outcomes and shortening the total project time. This paper explores to what extent synthetic data can replicate the feature importance characteristics of a real dataset, which is one of the key elements in the exploration stage.</figcaption>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The utility of synthetic data inevitably depends on the application for
which this data is intended, and this is reflected in the variety of
comparative measures of utility. This may in turn influence the trade-off with privacy that one might be willing to make. There is no single measure of utility that guarantees the usefulness of synthetic data for all conceivable purposes.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a set of novel measures of utility for synthetic

Feature importance describes a number of techniques for scoring or ranking the contribution of each feature in a dataset towards a prediction, when performing predictive modelling.

An affirmative answer to this question would allow for substantial practical benefits: It would mean that certain steps may then be conducted in advance of data access being granted, and a larger group of analysts, who do not require access to the data, can work on them. The outcome of any work carried out on the synthetic data can be refined in subsequent iterations with access to the original dataset.</p>

tasks performed by a data analyst. We focus on this task and consider a class of utility measures for synthetic data, based on the similarity of feature importance for particular modelling tasks, compared with the original dataset on which it is based. We use measures based on both the ranking of features by their importance, and also their importance scores.

Even when access is granted, this might be provided only to a limited number of individuals and within strictly controlled environments.

If synthetic data are useful for performing these tasks, analysis can start before full access is granted, saving a lot of time and allowing early insights to be gained. The final optimisation of the features and model can then be performed on the original data when they become available (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Faking feature importance: A cautionary tale on the use of differentially-private synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

We empirically explore their use in artificially generated and real-world datasets. Ideally, the synthesizers generate datasets in which ranks and feature importance scores of features are preserved.

The importance of a feature is measured by accumulating the improvement (where the feature was used in) over all the trees in the forest. The “Gini importance” or MDI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Breiman, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite> is an example of such a feature importance measure when the splitting criterion is the Gini index. Impurity-based importance is biased towards high cardinality features and can therefore be misleading for datasets that contain numerical features and categorical features with a large number of categories. They are computed using only training data and as a result they do not reflect the ability of a feature to make predictions that generalize to the test set. Nevertheless, they are computationally cheap to evaluate during the training of the model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.14" class="ltx_p">From Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem, doubly stochastic matrices can be decomposed into linear combination of permutation matrices whose coefficents each is greater than zero and all sum to one. Thus, doubly stochastic matrices can be interpreted as soft assignment over permutation matrices and does not force a one-to-one correspondence between features.

The features include observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling, assets found in the home, educational attainment, demographic data, etc. We removed several features of low importance from the dataset and converted the one-hot-encoded features to label-encoded, resulting in a dataset with 29 columns. The prediction task is to determine the poverty level of each household, which is a four-class classification problem. It is possible to combine/aggregate the characteristics of individuals in each household to engineer new features that increase predictive accuracy. In contrast to the other two datasets, this one contains a hierarchical structure (households-individuals). The synthetic algorithms we use do not capture this hierarchy as will be shown later.</p>

The engineered features are all less important than the non-engineered ones. The variance in the original data is small but increases a lot when using PrivBayes, especially when epsilon drops. The variance originates mainly from the synthetic data generation process which distorts the dataset’s joint distribution, with larger distortion when introducing more noise, as expected. Feature importances in the original data are somewhat distinct, with a steep curve in importance from left to right, although there is some clustering of similar importances after the eighth feature. The synthetic data mean importances partially capture this pattern but seem to fail to do so when epsilon is 0.0001. Independent column resampling is mostly uniform.</p>

The years of schooling that members of the household have gone through seems to be a strong predictor but there is also some variance here. The separation between feature importances of the features is not very large compared to the Adult dataset. There are 2-3 features with high importance but the remaining ones differ slightly, with some variance even in the original feature importances. The PrivBayes versions seem to completely miss the high importance of engineered features, giving them low importance and with large variance for all epsilon bounds. This is a result of the inability of PrivBayes to capture hierarchical structures in datasets; using PrivBayes effectively leads to a synthetic dataset where households have one member each. It is clear that in this case we expect a lot of rank swaps between features when using the synthetic data, even for the top features which affect rank-based similarity drastically. The Adult dataset is somewhat more stable and swaps do not happen for the top features.</p>

Importance scores for the original data are close to each other to the point where the exact rank is not fixed (e.g. age can be more or less important than the engineered feature “age MULT bmi” depending on the random seed). Synthetic versions seems to partially capture some of the most important features on the left side when epsilon is high and variance of importance values is lower than with the other two datasets. But the overall picture is of a dataset with relatively uniform importances which are challenging to replicate. This is partially explained by the fact that the Polish dataset has the highest multi-collinearity compared to the other two datasets. The average correlation (or correlation-like association for categorical values) between its features is 0.325 compared to 0.149 for the Adult and 0.219 for the Household dataset.</p>

PATE-CTGAN similarity is more uniform across epsilon bounds and overlaps with the baselines in most cases, except for the Adult dataset where it is better. Its similarity scores have slightly lower variance than PrivBayes for the Household and Polish datasets. It is worth noting that epsilon values of 0.1 or 0.4 are not considered as extremely low or as offering very strong privacy [GM: Reference from literature here needed, e.g. Show me your epsilons]. The independent column resampling baseline performs better than both synthetic algorithms for low epsilon values, especially in the Household and Polish datasets. In addition, when comparing with the third baseline (see Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Real-World Data ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Faking feature importance: A cautionary tale on the use of differentially-private synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, <span id="S5.I2.i2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath">RBO</span> similarity achieved by PrivBayes and PATE-CTGAN with high epsilon bounds is comparable with that achieved by a 1%-10% fraction of the original dataset. With low epsilon bounds, similarity is lower than that of a 1% subsample. A possible explanation for these results is that, with high privacy, the synthetic methods add so much noise to the data that the correlations between columns are effectively lost. Also, the marginal distributions of each column might become distorted as well, especially for continuous features which are discretised. Finally, there is generally large variance in all the similarity scores except when privacy is lowered significantly, demonstrating that synthetic data can lead to unpredictable results in contrast to the deterministic results produced by traditional anonymisation methods.</p>

<div id="S5.I2.i2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.I2.i2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In more detail, we observe the following patterns in individual datasets: Neither synthetic algorithm can replicate the hierarchical structure of the Household dataset, leading to assigning low scores to several important features, as shown previously. This affects the Cosine similarity a lot, as the angle between the importance vectors of the original and synthetic datasets increases. Synthetic Cosine similarity is almost never better than the independent column resampling baseline. Rank-based measures are also affected by this and overlap with the baselines. The Polish dataset performs only slightly better, with both synthetic algorithms overlapping significantly with the baselines and only performing better for high epsilon bounds. This is due to the uniformity of feature importances in this dataset, partially caused by multi-collinearity. Synthetic data perform better on the Adult dataset: Similarity measures are generally higher than the baselines for epsilon larger than 0.1 and PrivBayes has relatively small variance in this epsilon range. This is partially explained by the distinct importance values of several of the top features in the dataset, even though some of the less important features tend to have uniform importance (rank-based measures are affected much more by the leading features than the trailing ones). Also, the fact that Adult mostly consists of categorical variables and has a larger size than other datasets (which helps reduce variance between independent runs) might contribute to the higher similarity scores.</p>

The reason this happens is that the HousehThe ataset contains a hierarchical structure which the two algorithms cannot replicate. As a result, features that summarise household members’ information become much less useful and with lower scores as shown in the previous section and this is reflected in all three metrics. Performance for this dataset is comparable to the two baselines. In addition, PrivBayes similarity in this dataset increases weakly when decreasing privacy, showing that the main cause is due to the hierarchy and cannot be overcome with less noise.</p>

Synthetic data similarity is often worse that the naive baselines we set up but becomes better when some privacy is compromised or when the dataset has characteristics that facilitate accurate data synthesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We are able to draw some general conclusions about these characteristics from our experiments. Feature importance with synthetic data (and data synthesis in general) is easier (and with lower variance) when feature importances are not close to uniform and ideally when they are clearly distinct. Whether this happens depends on a number of factors and cannot always be predicted but we observe that datasets with high multicollinearity or features without much predictive value tend to make feature importances uniform and complicate the task. In addition, datasets with large numbers of rows and few columns are easier targets. Datasets with hierarchical structures (e.g. households and individuals) cannot be simulated accurately with the methods used in this paper and thus feature importance becomes inaccurate, especially if engineered features that summarise hierarchical information tend to be important. Finally, several synthetic methods are more suited to datasets with categorical features rather than numerical ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Using synthetic data for feature importance needs to be done with a lot of caution. We recommend that before synthetic data are used to perform any task, an initial investigation is warranted to understand the characteristics of the dataset in question and at least get a first estimate of whether synthetic methods are able to act as proxies. This investigation might involve preliminary runs in the original data, using some of the proposed metrics and algorithms (as well as others that might be relevant to particular applications). Unfortunately, this might defeat the purpose of starting preliminary analysis early, as this investigation requires some level of access to the original data or at least a sample of the original data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Future work will involve experimenting with more complex datasets that are used in practice, applying some of the above techniques to understand the limits of using synthetic data to shorten project runtimes. Healthcare applications are of particular interest given the typically long and complicated processes to get access to sensitive data. Through these applications, it is possible to improve our understand about how different dataset characteristics (e.g. non-linearities) affect our ability to synthesise accurately and capture feature importance and whether other types of feature importance measures and similarity measures have advantages over the methods proposed here. Another stream of potential work consists of exploring additional utility metrics for feature importance as well as for other parts of preliminary data analysis like feature selection. In this work, we used differential privacy as a privacy indicator but there are multiple alternative ways to quantify privacy which are more interpretable, e.g. probability of identification after various types of intruder attacks. It would be interesting to understand how the utility-privacy trade-off we observed in this work shifts when using these alternative definitions of privacy.</p>

<p id="A1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When applying Featuretools to create engineered features, we made specific hyperparameter choices that fit each dataset and also allow us to explore how different types of feature engineering impact on the ability of synthetic methods to capture feature importance. For the Adult dataset, we configure Featuretools to create separate entities/tables for the variables “education-num”, “workclass” and “occupation”, to use “max_depth=2” when creating features and we do not define specific primitives for feature creation. This results in a dataset with 141 features plus the predicted variable. For the Household dataset we configure Featuretools to create a separate entity containing all the household-level variables. We then create engineered features that summarise the information of all individuals in each household, using the primitives “min”, “max”, “count”, “mode”, “num_unique”, “std”, “sum” and setting “max_depth=2”. This results in a dataset with 39 features plus the predicted variable. For the Polish dataset, we configure Featuretools to apply the transformation primitives “multiply_numeric”, “subtract_numeric”, “add_numeric”, “divide_numeric”, “percentile” to all numeric variables and to use “max_depth=2”. This results in a dataset with 67 features plus the predicted variable.</p>
