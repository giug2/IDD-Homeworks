<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning algorithms, just like any other Machine learning algorithm pose a serious threat from adversaries. The adversaries can manipulate the learning algorithm resulting in non-optimal policies. In this paper, we analyze the Multi-task Federated Reinforcement Learning algorithms, where multiple collaborative agents in various environments are trying to maximize the sum of discounted return, in the presence of adversarial agents. We argue that the common attack methods are not guaranteed to carry out a successful attack on Multi-task Federated Reinforcement Learning and propose an adaptive attack method with better attack performance. Furthermore, we modify the conventional federated reinforcement learning algorithm to address the issue of adversaries that works equally well with and without the adversaries. Experimentation on different small to mid-size reinforcement learning problems show that the proposed attack method outperforms other general attack methods and the proposed modification to federated reinforcement learning algorithm was able to achieve near-optimal policies in the presence of adversarial agents.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained wide popularity in solving complex problems in an online fashion for various problem sets such as game playing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, autonomous navigation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, robotics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and network security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In most of the real-life cases where we do not have complete access to the system dynamics, conventional control theory fails to provide optimum solutions. Model-free RL on the other hand uses heuristics to explore and exploit the environment to achieve the underlying goal. With a boom in Internet of Things (IoT) devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, we have a lot of compute power at our disposal. The problem, however, is that the compute is distributed. Distributed algorithms have been studied to take advantage of these distributed compute agents. Conventional method consist of using these IoT as data-collectors and then using a centralized server to train a network on the collected data. Federated Learning, introduced by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> is a distributed approach to machine learning tasks enabling model training on large sets of decentralized data by individual agents. The key idea behind federated learning is to preserve the privacy of the data to the local node responsible for generating it. The training data is assumed to be local only, the agents however, can share the model parameter that is learned. This model sharing serves two purpose. Primarily it ensures the privacy of the data being generated locally, secondly in some of the cases the size of the model parameter might be much smaller than the size of the local data, hence sharing the model parameter instead of the data might save up on the communication cost involved. Federated learning has also been considered in the context of Reinforcement learning problem for both multi-agent RL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and multi-task RL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> where multiple RL agents either in a single or multiple environments try to jointly maximize the collective or sum of individual discounted returns, respectively.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While ML algorithms have proven to provide superior accuracy over conventional methods, they pose a threat from adversarial manipulations. Adversaries can use a variety of attack models to manipulate the model either in the training or the inference phase leading to decreased accuracy or poor policies. Common attack methods include data-poisoning and model poisoning where the adversary tries to manipulate the input data or directly the learned model respectively. In this paper, we propose and analyze a model-poisoning attack for the Multi-task Federated RL (MT-FedRL) problem and modify the conventional Federated RL approach to provide protection from model poisoning attacks.</p>

The adversary here acts in the form of specifically creating adversarial inputs to produce erroneous outputs to a learned model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. For supervised learning problems, such as a classification task, where the network model has already been trained, attacking the input is the most probable choice for an adversary to attack through.
In RL, there is no clear boundary between the training and test phase. The adversary can act either in the form of data-poisoning attacks, such as creating adversarial examples<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, or can directly attack the underlying learned policy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> either in terms of malicious falsification of reward signals, or estimating the RL dynamics from a batch data set and poisoning the policy.
Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, try to attack an RL agent by selecting an adversarial policy acting in a multi-agent environment as a result of creating observations that are adversarial in nature. Their results on a two-player zero-sum game show that an adversarial agent can be trained to interact with the victim winning reliably against it.
In federated RL, alongside the data-poisoning and policy-poisoning attacks, we also have to worry about the model-poisoning attacks. Since we have more than one learning agents, a complete agent can take up the role of an adversary. The adversarial agent can feed in false data to purposely corrupt the global model. In model poisoning attacks the adversary, instead of poisoning the input, tries to adversely modify the learned model parameters directly by feeding false information purposely poisoning the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Since federated learning uses an average operator to merge the local model parameters learned by individual agents, such attacks can severely affect the performance of the global model.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Adversarial training can be used to mitigate the effects of such adversaries. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> showed that the classification model can be made much robust against the adversarial examples by feature de-noising. The robustness of RL policies has also been analyzed by the adversarial training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> show that the data-poisoning can be made a part of RL training to learn more robust policies. They feed perturbed observations during RL training for the trained policy to be more robust to dynamically changing conditions during test time. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> shows that the data-poisoning attacks in federated learning can be resolved by modifying the federated aggregation operator based on induced ordered weighted averaging operators <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and filtering out possible adversaries.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no detailed research carried out on MT-FedRL in the presence of adversaries. In this paper, we address the effects of model poisoning attacks on the MT-FedRL problem.</p>

The adversarial agent needs to share the policy parameter that moves the distribution of the smoothing average of non-adversarial agents either to a uniform distribution or in the direction that purposely yields bad actions (Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV MT-FedRL with adversaries ‣ Multi-Task Federated Reinforcement Learning with Adversaries" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). Generally shifting the distribution to uniform distribution will require less energy than to shift it to a non-optimal action distribution. This requires that the adversary cancel out the information gained by all the other non-adversarial agents hence not being able to differentiate between good and bad actions, leaving all the actions equally likely.</p>

Hence, we propose Communication Adaptive Federated RL (<span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ComA-FedRL</span>) to address the adversarial attacks on a Federated RL algorithm. Instead of communicating the policy parameter from all agents at a fixed communication interval, we assign different communication intervals to agents based on the confidence of them being an adversary. An agent, with higher confidence of being an adversary, is assigned a large communication interval and vice-versa. Communicating less frequently with an adversary agent can greatly mitigate its effects on the learned unified policy. Since we can’t guarantee that a certain agent is an adversary or not, we can’t just cut off the communication with an agent we think would be an adversary. Moreover, an adversary can fake being a non-adversarial agent to get away with being marked as an adversarial agent. Hence, we don’t mark agents as adversary or non-adversary, rather we adaptively vary the communication interval between the server and the agents based on how good, on average, does the policy of the agent performs in other environments. The complete algorithm of <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ComA-FedRL</span> can be seen in Algo. <a href="#alg2" title="In VI Detecting attacks - ComA-FedRL ‣ Multi-Task Federated Reinforcement Learning with Adversaries" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ComA-FedRL</span> begins with a pre-train phase, where each agent tries to learn a locally optimistic policy independent of others. These locally optimistic policies are expected to perform better than a random policy on other agents’ environments. After every certain number of episodes, the server randomly assigns a policy to all the environments without replacement for evaluation, and the cumulative reward achieved by this policy is recorded. Based on the nature of the policy and the environment it is cross-evaluated in, we have four cases as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ VI Detecting attacks - ComA-FedRL ‣ Multi-Task Federated Reinforcement Learning with Adversaries" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. When the policy locally learned by a non-adversarial agent is evaluated in the environment of a non-adversarial agent, it generally performs better than a random policy because of the correlation of the underlying tasks. Hence we get a slightly higher cumulative reward compared to other cases. On the other hand, if an adversarial policy is cross-evaluated on a non-adversarial agent’s environment, it generally performs worse because of the inherent nature of the adversary, giving a low cumulative reward. When the policies are evaluated on the adversarial agent’s environment, the adversary can present a secondary attack in faking the cumulative reward. It intentionally reports a low cumulative return with the hopes of confusing the server to mistake a non-adversarial agent with an adversarial one. Since the adversarial agent has no way of knowing if the policy shared by the server belongs to an adversarial or a non-adversarial agent, it always shares a low cumulative return.</p>

<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">At the end of the pre-train phase, the cumulative rewards are averaged out for a given policy and are compared to a threshold. If the averaged cumulative reward of the policy is below (above) this threshold, the policy is marked as <span id="S6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">possibly-adversarial</span> (<span id="S6.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">possibly-non-adversarial</span>). The <span id="S6.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">possibly-adversarial</span> agents are assigned a higher communication interval (less frequent communication), while <span id="S6.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">possibly-non-adversarial</span> agents are assigned a smaller communication interval (more frequent communication). The agents are constantly re-evaluated after a certain number of iterations and the categories associated with the agents are updated. After re-evaluation, if an already marked possible-adversary agent is re-marked as <span id="S6.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">possibly-adversary</span>, the agent’s communication interval is doubled, signifying a higher probability of it being an adversary and making it contribute even lesser towards the server smoothing average. Hence as the training proceeds, the adversarial agent’s contribution to the server smoothing average becomes smaller and smaller.</p>

For a higher learning rate, the local update for each agent’s policy parameter has more effect than the update of the server carried out with the adversary, and hence poorer the performance of the attack. Another thing to observe is that as the learning rate increases the relative performance of the OppositeGoal attack compared to the Random policy attack becomes poorer even becoming worse than the Random policy attack. The reason behind this is that the observable states across environments are non-overlapping. The environment available to the adversary for devising OppositeGoal attack from might not have access to the states observable in other environments. Hence the OppositeGoal policy attack can not modify the policy parameter related to those states. OppositeGoal policy attack method either require a large scaling factor or more than one adversary to attack the MT-FedRL with performance similar to <span id="S7.SS1.p3.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">AdAMInG</span> with single-adversary and unity scaling factor <math id="S7.SS1.p3.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS1.p3.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S7.SS1.p3.5.m5.1.1" xref="S7.SS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml">λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS1.p3.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S7.SS1.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS1.p3.5.m5.1.1">𝜆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS1.p3.5.m5.1c">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we analyse Multi-task Federated Reinforcement Learning algorithm with an adversarial perspective.
We analyze the attacking performance of some general attack methods and propose an adaptive attack method <span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">AdAMInG</span> that devises an attack taking into account the aggregation operator of federated RL. The <span id="S8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">AdAMinG</span> attack method is formulated and its effectiveness is studied. Furthermore, to address the issue of adversaries in MT-FedRL problem, we propose a communication adaptive modification to conventional federated RL algorithm, <span id="S8.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ComA-FedRL</span>, that varies the communication frequency for the agents based on their probability of being an adversary. Results on the problems of GridWorld (maze solving) and AutoNav (drone autonomous navigation) show that the <span id="S8.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">AdAMInG</span> attack method outperforms other attack methods almost every time. Moreover, <span id="S8.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">ComA-FedRL</span> was able to recover from the adversarial attack resulting in near-optimal policies.</p>
