<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm that enables the exploitation of clients’ vast amounts of unlabeled data while preserving data privacy. While FSSL offers advantages, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, a concern identified in traditional federated supervised learning (FSL), has not been investigated. To fill the research gap, we undertake a comprehensive investigation into a backdoor attack paradigm, where unscrupulous clients conspire to manipulate the global model, revealing the vulnerability of FSSL to such attacks. In FSL, backdoor attacks typically build a direct association between the backdoor trigger and the target label. In contrast, in FSSL, backdoor attacks aim to alter the global model’s representation for images containing the attacker’s specified trigger pattern in favor of the attacker’s intended target class, which is less straightforward. In this sense, we demonstrate that existing defenses are insufficient to mitigate the investigated backdoor attacks in FSSL, thus finding an effective defense mechanism is urgent.
To tackle this issue, we dive into the fundamental mechanism of backdoor attacks on FSSL, proposing the <span id="id10.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Embedding Inspector (EmInspector)</span> that detects malicious clients by inspecting the embedding space of local models.
In particular, EmInspector assesses the similarity of embeddings from different local models using a small set of inspection images (e.g., ten images of CIFAR100) without specific requirements on sample distribution or labels. We discover that embeddings from backdoored models tend to cluster together in the embedding space for a given inspection image. Evaluation results show that EmInspector can effectively mitigate backdoor attacks on FSSL across various adversary settings.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although self-supervised learning (SSL) frees model training from the burdens of costly data annotation efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, it demands a massive amount of data to achieve comparable performance to its supervised counterpart, e.g., 400 million image-text pairs for training the CLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and one billion noisy image-text pairs for training the ALIGN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Such a massive volume of data can be overwhelming for individuals or organizations and could become an insurmountable obstacle for model training in certain fields where data is scarce. In this regard, federated SSL (FSSL) employs a distributed learning approach and offers an alternative to address the data provision issue. This is because contemporary edge devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Various research works of FSSL on practical usage such as audio recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, video understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and disease diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, have emerged recently, showcasing its immense potential.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, as the traditional federated supervised learning (FSL) paradigm is vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to its decentralized nature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, this vulnerability may also be inherited in FSSL. According to our survey, prior research has mainly focused on the vulnerability of traditional FSL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> or centralized SSL frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> while lacking in treating in FSSL.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Distinctions of backdoor attacks in FSSL and FSL.</span>
In FSL, malicious clients execute backdoor attacks by uploading crafted models trained on mismatched data-label (i.e., the target label) pairs with a trigger. The aim is to mislead the global model to predict the attacker’s desired label for inputs embedded with the attacker’s chosen trigger. In FSSL, each trained model only outputs embeddings (features) of input data, and the predicting process relies on downstream classifiers. Thus, for a successful backdoor attack, malicious clients should modify their local models to generate similar embeddings for inputs containing the attacker’s chosen trigger and twist these embeddings to the attacker’s target class <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. As a result, any downstream classifier built based on the frozen backdoored global model as a backbone will misclassify inputs with a similar trigger into the same target class. In conclusion, backdoor attacks in FSL build a direct association between the backdoor trigger and the target label in the low-dimensional label space (e.g., 10 in CIFAR10) while in FSSL, backdoors are embedded in the high-dimensional embedding space (e.g., 512 of ResNet18), which is less explicit and more challenging to detect.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Infeasibilities of existing defenses.</span>
In the literature, there have been numerous defenses for safeguarding FL against model poisoning attacks like untargeted attacks that aim to degrade the model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> and backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Most of them are based on statistical characteristics of uploaded local model parameters/gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, aiming to filter outliers. Besides inspecting model parameters directly, some others use a set of inspection data to acquire feedback (e.g., labels and embeddings) from uploaded local models to detect whether they are backdoored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Both the existing statistical-based and feedback-based defense strategies share a common underlying principle: they aim to identify and discard potentially malicious models by assessing their dissimilarity to the majority of models recognized as benign.</span> However, thanks to the high-dimensional outputs in FSSL, backdoored models can be optimized with a loss constraint (Eq. <a href="#S4.E2" title="In IV Backdoor Attacks on FSSL ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) to have very similar outputs on clean samples with benign models.
This practice also suppresses the deviation in model parameters between the backdoored model and its benign counterpart to a teeny-tiny level.
<span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Furthermore, defeating the intuition proposed in the literature of FSL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, we discover that one backdoored local model in FSSL is prone to generate more similar embeddings (i.e., non-outliers) with other models when inputting identical images.</span> Therefore, existing defenses designed based on outlier detection (both statistical-based and feedback-based) could fail, as we demonstrated in Sec. <a href="#S7" title="VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our works and contributions.</span> To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a comprehensive exploration of backdoor attacks on FSSL to fill this research gap.
Generally, backdoor attacks on FSSL can be divided into two paradigms depending on the attacker’s capability: one in which the attacker can only poison a limited number of images in clients’ training datasets, and the other in which the attacker has full control over a certain number of malicious clients to manipulate the loss function, hyper-parameters, training data, optimizer, and training process arbitrarily. According to the experimental results (refer Fig. <a href="#A1.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ Attacking with/without freezing BN layers: ‣ A-F Additional Experimental results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a> in Appendix <a href="#A1.SS6" title="A-F Additional Experimental results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">A-F</span></span></a>), we observe that the first data-poisoning-based attack paradigm has minimal effects on FSSL owing to the strict requirements for its success and the damping effect caused by data augmentations used by SSL and global aggregation. Therefore, we primarily focus on the second paradigm, which poses a more substantial threat to FSSL systems. We relegate the detailed description of the first paradigm to Appendix <a href="#A1.SS2" title="A-B Data-poisoning-based backdoor attack ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">A-B</span></span></a>.
Moreover, we demonstrate that existing defenses are inadequate in mitigating the investigated backdoor attacks in FSSL. To counter the threat of backdoor attacks in FSSL, we dive into the fundamental working mechanism of backdoor attacks on FSSL and then elaborate on the idea of embedding inspection to propose a novel defense mechanism for FSSL against backdoor attacks, i.e. Embedding Inspector (EmInspector). Our EmInspector mechanism is predicated on a crucial observation, i.e., for a given image, embeddings generated by backdoored local models tend to cluster together and stay within the region of embeddings produced by benign local models in the embedding space (refer Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-A Key observations ‣ V Design of EmInspector ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmInspector only requires minimal inspection images (e.g., ten samples are enough in experiments with CIFAR100) to accurately identify backdoored models, without specific requirements on sample distribution or labels. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An FSSL system typically consists of two components: a pretext task at the client side, designed to learn representations from unlabelled data, and an aggregation algorithm at the server side to aggregate local models uploaded by clients.
For pretext tasks, a commonly used approach is contrastive learning, as demonstrated by methods like SimCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and MoCo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In contrastive learning, two different augmentations of the same image are considered as a positive pair, and the model aims to make their representations similar. On the other hand, two different images are treated as a negative pair, and the model strives to make their representations dissimilar. This approach enables the model to learn meaningful representations that capture the underlying structure of the data.
For aggregation, FedAVG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> is the most widely-used method which uses the average of all uploaded models as the new global model. Moreover, as data held by different clients usually have various distributions, model consistency of the aggregated model has gained much popularity and motivated various research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>.

BadEncoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> assumes access to a clean pre-trained image encoder and a set of unlabeled images.
By fine-tuning the pre-trained encoder with an elaborately designed loss function and a reference image of the attacker’s target class, BadEncoder aims to mislead the encoder to recognize data containing the specific trigger pattern as the target class.</p>

In the literature, most current defenses against backdoor attacks in FL are designed based on inspecting local models’ parameters or gradients directly to detect outlier models: Deepsight <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> performs deep model inspection for each model by checking its Normalized Update Energies (NEUPs) and Division Differences (DDifs). Foolsgold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> punishes clients that have historical updates with high pairwise cosine similarities by a low learning rate. FLAME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> bounds the added noise of differential privacy defenses to mitigate the negative impact on primary tasks. RFLBAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to separate malicious models from benign models in a low dimensional space.
Most related to our work that detects malicious clients through inspecting the embedding space is Flare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, which is designed based on an observation that embeddings from backdoored models are outliers among those from benign models.</p>

Also, malicious clients expect to maintain the accuracy of the primary task for stealthy purposes.
Specifically, malicious clients may backdoor their models and upload these corrupt results to the server.</p>

We consider that malicious clients have knowledge of the global model’s architecture and can manipulate their local datasets, redesign the loss function, and alter the model training process arbitrarily. Moreover, malicious clients can collude with each other to enhance the effect of the backdoor attack, as we will interpret in detail later.
However, malicious clients are largely unaware of other details of the FSSL system, including models from benign clients and the aggregation rule of the server.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Injecting triggers.</span>
Specifically, each malicious client needs to inject triggers into its local model and keep them stealthy.
To achieve this objective, the first step for malicious clients is to generate similar feature vectors for data containing triggers and data about the target class (designated as reference data).
Moreover, to increase the potency and efficiency of the attack, they also ensure that the backdoored model accurately identifies the reference data by guiding it to produce a similar feature vector for the reference data with the clean model, as explained in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.

Briefly speaking, malicious clients first work in collusion to backdoor the global SSL model, and the learned representation will transfer to downstream supervised tasks. We will make a comparison between the two collusion methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of EmInspector against both of them in Sec. <a href="#S7.SS2" title="VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VII-B</span></span></a>.</p>

In practice, malicious clients can launch attacks in any round of FSSL.
However, they are more likely to launch attacks when the global model is close to convergence to reduce the negative effect on the performance of primary tasks, as pointed out by Xie <span id="S4.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
In addition, Bagdasaryan <span id="S4.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> suggests that initializing the attack when the global model is close to convergence would make the attack more efficient. Therefore, we begin attacking when the global model is close to convergence by default. We also conduct an ablation experiment to verify the impact of the attack timing and the result is presented in Sec. <a href="#S7.SS1" title="VII-A AQ1 (Answer Q1): Attack Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VII-A</span></span></a>.</p>

We find that this attack paradigm can achieve backdoor objectives by fine-tuning model parameters to an extremely small extent in FSSL systems.
This makes backdoored and benign models of high similarity, causing the failures of various existing defense mechanisms, which we will discuss in Section <a href="#S7.SS2" title="VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VII-B</span></span></a>. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a defense mechanism that can mitigate backdoor attacks effectively while maintaining the performance of the model on primary tasks in FSSL systems.</p>

Moreover, we can observe that the gap relative error increases first and then decreases to a stable value. This can be explained by the fact that the model initially cannot give much weightage to the trigger, and thus tends to rely more on the clean part of the poisoned images in the beginning, to explore the information. Along with the training process, the model will pay more attention to the trigger, and thus the gap relative error will decrease.</p>

In contrast, the distribution of the training data would not change the stable nature of backdoor objectives, as we can observe that embeddings from malicious models clustered together and stay beside the embedding from the current global model under both i.i.d and non-i.i.d settings.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recall the observations discussed above, for the same image, we find that the embeddings generated by backdoored models usually congregate in a certain place and intermingle with features extracted by benign models. Conversely, the distribution of embeddings generated by benign models is ruleless.
This means that embeddings generated by backdoored models are usually similar to those generated by all the other models, while there is randomness for benign models.
Based on this, we suggest detecting poisoned models by inspecting the embeddings generated by all uploaded local models and formally proposing the Embedding Inspector (EmInspector). In particular, EmInspector uses a set of inspection data to inspire the “constancy” of backdoored models and detect them based on the accumulated similarity values between output features from all the uploaded local models.</p>

Without other mentioned, we follow a practical setting similar to the previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, in which the attacker begins to attack when the global model is close to convergence.
We choose “truck”, “airplane”, “camel” and “priority road sign” as our target class for CIFAR10, STL10, CIFAR100, and GTSRB, respectively. In particular, malicious clients will embed triggers into all images in their local training datasets to maximize the efficiency of the attack.
The triggers and the reference images of the target classes we use are illustrated in Fig. <a href="#A1.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ A-E Experiment setup ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> and <a href="#A1.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ A-E Experiment setup ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> in Appendix <a href="#A1.SS5" title="A-E Experiment setup ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">A-E</span></span></a>, respectively.

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Attacking early v.s. Attacking later.</span> To verify the impact of the attack timing, we consider two scenarios: attacking from the beginning vs.. attacking when the global model is close to convergence.
We employ a single pattern attack with 20% malicious clients for evaluation.
For the former scenario, we initiate the attack at round 5 for CIFAR10 and STL10, and at round 35 for CIFAR100, respectively. For the latter, we will attack when the global model is nearing convergence. To simplify our description, we refer to the former scenario as “attack early” and the latter as “attack late”.
In Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-B FSSL Setting ‣ VI Experimental Setup ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we illustrate the training process after attacks begin. We observe that in both scenarios, both the ACC and ASR increase along with the training process, while the ASR converges much faster if we attack later. To our surprise, attacking at an early stage of network training does not seem to negatively impact the primary task accuracy, contrary to the understanding of previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. This counterintuitive result indicates that the investigated backdoor attack can be launched at any round without hurting the performance of primary tasks, thereby highlighting the severity of backdoor attacks on FSSL.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Comparison of different prop. of MCs.</span> The top row of Tab. <a href="#S7.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> displays the ACC of the initial clean global model, along with the initial ASR triggered by the global trigger pattern. This serves as a baseline for evaluating the efficacy of backdoor attacks on FSSL. The subsequent rows exhibit ACCs and ASRs of backdoored global models that are trained with various proportions of malicious clients and two different collusion methods.
Notably, both single and coordinated pattern attacks achieve ASRs of over 95% once the proportion of malicious clients reaches 20% for CIFAR10 and STL10 datasets. With a lower proportion of 10%, such attacks can still achieve ASRs of over 50%.
Despite being a more intricate dataset, CIFAR100 is also vulnerable to backdoor attacks, with 20% of malicious clients achieving an ASR of approximately 70%.
Moreover, all attacks have a negligible impact on the primary task accuracy, making it difficult to notice the existence of backdoors. We also depict the training process in Fig. <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI-B FSSL Setting ‣ VI Experimental Setup ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, revealing that as the proportion of malicious clients increases, the ASR converges faster.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Comparison of two collusion methods.</span> According to Fig. <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI-B FSSL Setting ‣ VI Experimental Setup ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, it is evident that ASRs in single pattern attacks converge faster compared to in coordinate pattern attacks when the proportion of malicious clients is identical.
This can be attributed to the fact that all malicious clients in a single pattern attack employ the same trigger to backdoor the global model, thereby enhancing the effect of this trigger, let alone the trigger used in a single pattern attack is larger, being easier for the model to perceive.
Although coordinated pattern attacks are less efficient, they may bring more challenges to the design of defense mechanisms as each malicious client uses a unique trigger to execute the attack, making the changes of local models of more variety.</p>

We interpret this phenomenon as being caused by the extensive number of classes in CIFAR100, some of which may share common features, resulting in minor differences between them. Consequently, the attacker might overfine-tune the model with our preset learning rate, leading to a rapid decline in the ASR.</p>

To evaluate the efficacy of backdoor attacks on FSSL across different network architectures, we test a single pattern attack with 20% malicious clients on CIFAR10 with four distinct global model architectures, i.e. ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and VGG19_bn.
Note that before launching an attack, the image encoders of different networks have been pre-trained for identical rounds. Our results are presented in Fig. <a href="#S7.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VII-A AQ1 (Answer Q1): Attack Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> (b), proving that the investigated backdoor attacks are effective across different network architectures.
Moreover, we observe that when the pre-trained global models are of similar ACCs (see Tab. <a href="#S7.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ VII-A AQ1 (Answer Q1): Attack Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>), the ASR on ResNet18 converges faster than on ResNet34, which in turn, converges faster than on ResNet50. This suggests that attacks on more complex networks exhibit a slower convergence speed. We also notice that the ASR on VGG19_bn is significantly lower than on ResNets. Our interpretation for this is that the residual connection in ResNet helps to build a shortcut between the target class with the backdoor trigger, as also studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.</p>

For example, with CIFAR10 and GTSRB as the pre-training dataset and downstream dataset, the backdoored model and the clean model achieve ASRs of 98.12% and 4.79%, respectively. This large gap between the two ASRs indicates a highly effective backdoor attack. Moreover, the accuracy of the backdoored model on clean inputs is not affected, indicating the backdoor attack of high utility (i.e., the attack is stealth).</p>

Tab. <a href="#S7.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VII-A AQ1 (Answer Q1): Attack Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> shows the performance of our EmInspector against seven existing defense methods under two different collusion methods and the non-i.i.d setting. From the results, it is evident that despite the deployment of the existing defenses, the global model still is infiltrated by malicious clients, exhibiting backdoor behaviors. This observation leads to the conclusion that existing defense strategies are inadequate in mitigating backdoor attacks on FSSL. On the one hand, the failures of statistical-based methods (i.e., the former six baselines in Tab. <a href="#S7.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VII-A AQ1 (Answer Q1): Attack Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>) indicate that the parameters of backdoored models have minimal deviations from those of benign models. On the other hand, though FLARE also detects backdoored models by inspecting local models’ embedding space, it is based on an observation that is untenable in FSSL, which is exactly the opposite of ours. This reveals that embeddings from backdoored models are not outliers among those from benign models. In contrast, our EmInspector successfully maintains ASRs at a low level without obviously degrading the primary task accuracy across all datasets. Specifically, EmInspector ensures the increase of the ASR of no more than 5% on CIFAR10, no more than 2% on STL10, and maintains the ASR on CIFAR100 at a level of nearly 0%.
Moreover, the degradation of the primary task accuracy is less than 1% on CIFAR10 and less than 1.54% on CIFAR100, whereas, on STL10, the primary task accuracy increases by about 1%. Our findings demonstrate that EmInspector outperforms existing defense methods by a significant margin in mitigating backdoor attacks on FSSL.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, it is common for multiple groups of clients to have very similar local data distributions in the real world. Therefore, we conduct some experiments under an i.i.d data setting across CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 to further demonstrate the vulnerability of FSSL to backdoor attacks and the effectiveness of EmInspector. For attacks, we adopt the single pattern attack of 1:1 attack degree with two different proportions of malicious clients, namely 20% and 30%. Results are presented in Tab. <a href="#S7.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ VII-A AQ1 (Answer Q1): Attack Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, where we can see that the investigated backdoor attack is also of high efficacy, achieving ASRs of over 80% on both datasets. Furthermore, the gap of ASRs between the FSSL system deployed with EmInspector and with FedAvg (e.g., on CIFAR10 with 20% malicious clients, ASR of 12.09 vs. 91.42) indicates that EmInspector remains highly effective in detecting malicious clients even though under the i.i.d data settings.</p>

EmInspector does not require the inspection data to conform to a specific sample distribution. Thus we characterize the inspection dataset by its size.
Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> (a) shows ASRs under a single pattern attack with 20% malicious clients when the size of the inspection dataset increases from 10 to 100. Our results indicate that using only ten inspection images is sufficient for EmInspector to effectively mitigate backdoors on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. For STL10, though a larger inspection dataset is required, 50 is enough. These findings demonstrate that EmInspector with very few inspection images is effective in detecting malicious clients.</p>

A test is done on CIFAR10 to evaluate the effectiveness of EmInspector under adversary settings of various proportions of malicious clients, ranging from 10% to 50%. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> (b), EmInspector is robust against various ratios of malicious clients. Moreover, we use 100 images sampled from the GTSRB dataset to investigate the effectiveness of using out-of-distribution data as the inspection data. The purple curve in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> (b) indicates that even though the inspection data is out-of-distribution with the training data, EmInspector still works effectively.
In addition, we substitute the 100 inspection images with 100 randomly generated vectors of the same dimension with an inspection image and discover that EmInspector can still perform effectively when the proportion of malicious clients reaches 40%, as demonstrated by the blue curve in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> (b). However, EmInspector performs poorly when the proportion of malicious clients is below this threshold and it is more prone to make misclassifications than using clean images as inspection data. This approach can serve as a remedy when the server lacks access to clean images but has an approximation of the ratio of malicious clients.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">AQ3: Identification accuracy of EmInspector.</span>
After each inspection image is fed, we record which client is identified as malicious by EmInspector and the malicious scores of all clients. We find that in each round, a true malicious client is correctly identified as malicious on average in more than 70 out of 100 inspection images, while benign clients misclassified as malicious varied with different inspection images. Consequently, the final malicious score for a benign client is typically less than 0 after all the inspection images are inputted. Even if a benign client is misclassified as malicious, the malicious score remains low (always below 10), whereas the malicious score of a true malicious client is consistently much larger (always exceeds 40).
Moreover, we have observed some intriguing phenomena in our experiments conducted with different attack settings, and the statistical outcomes are presented in Tab. <a href="#S7.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>. In Tab. <a href="#S7.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>, FPR (false positive rate) means the rate of benign clients misclassified as malicious by EmInspector, and TPR (true positive rate) means the rate of malicious clients correctly classified by EmInspector. B-MS/M-MS means the average malicious score of benign/malicious clients in each round.
Initially, we consider an FSSL system without malicious clients to measure the FPR of EmInspector. From Tab. <a href="#S7.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a> we can see that under a non-adversary setting, the FPR is 35%. The reason is that we use the mean or the median value of all similarities as the threshold (i.e., the decision boundary <math id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\hat{d}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1a"><mover accent="true" id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mo id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">^</mo></mover><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1"><ci id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.1">^</ci><ci id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑑</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS2.p7.1.m1.1c">\hat{d}</annotation></semantics></math>) to make decisions. However, since we assume no prior knowledge about the system (e.g., the proportion of malicious clients), it is non-trivial to design a threshold that achieves high TPR and low FPR simultaneously.
<span id="S7.SS2.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The comforting thing is that the impact on the ACC is negligible (from 71.06% to 70.64%).</span>
We can also note that B-Ms is still lower than 0 under a non-adversary setting, indicating the correctness of our thoughts behind EmInspector.
In addition, using Eq. <a href="#S5.E9" title="In V-B Backdoor Mitigation for FSSL ‣ V Design of EmInspector ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> as the decision boundary outperforms using Eq. <a href="#S5.E7" title="In V-B Backdoor Mitigation for FSSL ‣ V Design of EmInspector ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> since it can largely decrease the FPR when there is no malicious client (see the first two rows of Tab. <a href="#S7.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>).
Moreover, it is noteworthy that the increase in the proportion of malicious clients or attack degrees will lead to lower FPR. We posit that this is due to the greater number of malicious clients contributing to the identification of one another and the higher attack degree makes the attack objective further highlighted, resulting in more concentrated embeddings from malicious clients. When the proportion of malicious reaches 20%, EmInspector only gets the FPR of 5% or lower, which can be neglected compared to its TPR of 100% across all proportions of malicious clients and attack degrees.</p>

<div id="S7.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, if we assume the defender knows the proportion of malicious clients, we can adjust the threshold accordingly. For example, we consider an FSSL system consisting of 10% malicious clients, and the defender knows an estimation of the proportion. Then he can adjust the threshold to remove models that get 10% top embedding similarities and reserve some space for fluctuations (e.g., 10% to 20%, i.e., regarding models of top 20% to 30% embedding similarities as malicious). The reason for reserving some space for fluctuations is that different inspection images may have different effects on detecting malicious clients, and the “constancy level” of malicious clients is different under various adversary settings. Less fluctuation space is needed as the proportion of malicious clients increases or the attack degree increases. Therefore, we adopt 20% (relatively high) fluctuation for this experiment and the result is presented in the last row of Tab. <a href="#S7.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>. This adjustment can decrease the FPR from 20% to 0%, indicating that if we have some prior knowledge, we can make adjustments accordingly and work better.</p>

Additionally, we propose that each malicious client can employ a distinct clean model to produce reference embeddings, thereby achieving their respective backdoor objectives. This approach leads to less similarity between embeddings generated by backdoored models compared to using an identical clean model. To obtain distinct clean models, we consider adaptive malicious clients who first fine-tune the initial clean global model on their training datasets before executing backdoor attacks. The results, presented in Tab. <a href="#S7.T9" title="TABLE IX ‣ VII-B Defense Results ‣ VII Experimental Results ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a>, demonstrate that EmInspector can accurately detect malicious clients even when each malicious client utilizes a different model to guide the optimization for the backdoor objectives.</p>

<p id="S8.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this scenario, we consider that malicious clients are aware of the criterion used by EmInspector to measure the similarity between embeddings from local clients, i.e., cosine similarity in Eq. <a href="#S5.E6" title="In V-B Backdoor Mitigation for FSSL ‣ V Design of EmInspector ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Under these circumstances, the malicious clients can modify the criterion they use for optimizing their backdoor objectives, such as employing Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy loss in Eq. <a href="#S4.E1" title="In IV Backdoor Attacks on FSSL ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Eq. <a href="#S4.E2" title="In IV Backdoor Attacks on FSSL ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> to replace cosine similarity, in an attempt to counteract EmInspector.</p>

Additionally, we have experimented with other optimizers, such as Adam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, to train backdoored models, but still encountered difficulties in achieving a high ASR. This indicates that even though malicious clients possess knowledge about the criterion employed by EmInspector to measure embedding similarity, designing a new attack method with novel loss functions is necessary to counteract EmInspector, which can be a complex task.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have conducted a systematic study of backdoor attacks on FSSL through extensive experiments. The results show that FSSL is susceptible to backdoor attacks and existing robust defense methods are invalid in mitigating them. The attacker can inject backdoors into the global model without impairing the primary tasks. To address this security gap, we have proposed EmInspector, the first defense mechanism against backdoor attacks on FSSL. EmInspector is easy to implement yet highly effective, requiring only a few inspection images and minimal additional computation at the server. In particular, EmInspector has proven to be highly effective in mitigating backdoors on FSSL, regardless of the network architecture, proportion of malicious clients, distribution of training data of local clients, and attack degrees. Our extensive evaluations have demonstrated that EmInspector can accurately identify malicious clients hidden in the FSSL system while maintaining the accuracy of primary tasks.</p>

The attacker in a data-poisoning-based backdoor attack only can randomly poison several images of some clients’ local training datasets. Clients who train their models with poisoned datasets are manipulated by the attacker. The attacker is also largely unaware of other details of the FSSL system, including models from benign clients and the aggregation rule of the server.</p>

In FLTrust, the service provider itself bootstraps trust by maintaining a server model. Specifically, FLTrust assigns a trust score to each local model update based on its cosine similarity with the server model update and then normalizes the magnitudes of the local model updates to limit the impact of malicious local model updates. Finally, the server achieves an aggregated model based on these normalized local model updates and their trust scores.</p>

In particular, we randomly sample 50 images for each class from the labeled training dataset of CIFAR10 / STL10 to formulate a mini dataset respectively. For CIFAR100, we formulate the mini dataset by randomly sampling 10 classes including the target class from the training set, with each class also having 50 images. For each mini dataset, we measure the gap between our target class and other classes as follows:</p>

In the pre-training phase, we randomly select 3 local clients from the overall 25 clients to train a global SSL model in each communication round.
On CIFAR10 and STL10, we pre-train for 400 rounds and 200 rounds respectively, with each client having 2,000 unlabeled images to train a local model for 10 local epochs.
On CIFAR100, to get a model of relatively high accuracy, we set each client to have 5,000 unlabeled images. The training also lasts for 200 rounds.</p>

For the data-poisoning-based backdoor attack scenario, we poison all images belonging to the “truck” category in CIFAR10 or the “came” category in CIFAR100 and train the model for 100 rounds. The clients who train with these poisoned images are assumed to be malicious.
Because STL10 only contains 5,000 labeled images, we do not evaluate the data-poisoning-based attack on it.

<p id="A1.SS6.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct an ablation experiment to explore the impact of freezing parameters of the BN layers. Fig. <a href="#A1.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ A-E Experiment setup ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> shows that the attack efficiency grows and the ASR is more persistent when the BN layers are frozen.
We infer that this phenomenon may be attributed to the leakage of information within the mini-batch during the updating of BN layers. This can give the impression that the model easily discovers a solution with low loss, but it is ultimately a deceitful solution that does not align with the training objective, as expounded in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, because the poisoned images comprise identical triggers, the damage that can be caused by the information leakage may be even more catastrophic.</p>

<p id="A1.SS6.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The attacker executing the data-poisoning-based attack shall introduce triggers to a specific category (i.e. its target class), and have them utilized during model training.
These data with triggers can mislead the trained SSL model to build a connection between the trigger and the target class. In FSSL, several malicious clients may use some data with triggers to train their models, and then upload these poisoned models to backdoor the global model. The connection between the trigger and a certain class is weak in local models and stochastic in different local models. Thus, this backdoor module can be eliminated easily via aggregation, resulting in a low ASR, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#A1.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ Attacking with/without freezing BN layers: ‣ A-F Additional Experimental results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ EmInspector: Combating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Self-Supervised Learning Through Embedding Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>.</p>
