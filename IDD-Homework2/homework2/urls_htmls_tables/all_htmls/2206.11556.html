<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, cooperative edge caching problem is studied in fog radio access networks (F-RANs). Given the non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard) property of the problem, a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) based caching update algorithm is proposed to make an optimal caching decision by learning the dynamic network environment. In order to protect user data privacy and solve the problem of slow convergence of the single deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model training, we propose a federated reinforcement learning method with quantization (FRLQ) to implement cooperative training of models from multiple fog access points (F-APs) in F-RANs. To address the excessive consumption of communications resources caused by model transmission, we prune and quantize the shared DRL models to reduce the number of model transfer parameters. The communications interval is increased and the communications rounds are reduced by periodical model global aggregation. We analyze the global convergence and computational complexity of our policy. Simulation results verify that our policy has better performance in reducing user request delay and improving cache hit rate compared to benchmark schemes. The proposed policy is also shown to have faster training speed and higher communications efficiency with minimal loss of model accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, mobile data traffic is exploding due to the widespread popularity of mobile services, social networks and resource-intensive applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Various mobile device applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), virtual reality and augmented reality, require higher network throughput and tighter network delay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The traditional base station (BS)-centric network architecture can no longer meet these demands, so a new network architecture is needed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Fog radio access network (F-RAN) is a promising solution to the congestion problem of cellular network communications. In F-RANs, fog access points (F-APs) are located at the edge of the networks and therefore closer to users than the cloud server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Edge caching technology allows F-APs to store popular contents in the networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Therefore, F-APs can effectively reduce both the load pressure on backhaul links and content delivery delay. Due to the limited communications resources and local storage capacity of F-APs, however, how to cache the most popular contents has become the main challenge of edge caching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several research works have been published on content placement for edge caching. In<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, by considering the popularity and location factors of contents, a cooperative caching scheme was proposed to cooperatively transmit contents to users in vehicular networks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, an iterative cache layout algorithm with convex approximation was developed to solve the cache layout problem in device-to-device (D2D) networks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, game theory was implemented to solve the caching problem by considering different participants (e.g., BS, mobile network operation (MNO), user equipment (UE)) competing with each other to minimize transmission delay and service cost in the networks.
Different from game theory and optimization theory, stochastic geometry schemes realize content caching and replacement by using the corresponding statistical characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the authors developed an analytical framework based on a probabilistic model from stochastic geometry to characterize the performance of the proposed caching policy in terms of cache hit rate.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a probabilistic content placement based best tradeoff between content diversity gain and collaborative gain, and stochastic geometry tool was applied to quantify the tradeoff.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, learning algorithms have in recent years been used widely to optimize content caching problems by learning key attribute features, such as user request behavior, content popularity, and user mobility distribution.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors used the supervised learning approach to design an online content popularity prediction algorithm based on content features and user preference.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, for random content requests, the researchers used <math id="S1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>-means and <math id="S1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) unsupervised algorithms to implement inter-cluster and intra-cluster caching, respectively.
A deep learning-based active caching scheme was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> that collected sparse information about the relevance between content and specific users from a content popularity matrix.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning (RL) for edge caching has also received significant attention in recent years due to its advantage in decision-making in non-stationary environments. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, a Markov decision process (MDP) was used to characterize the content request model to describe the temporal and spatial fluctuation of traffic demand in F-RANs.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the authors applied a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to implement the dynamic caching decision and optimize the content delivery problem. To overcome the curse of dimensionality of RL and improve the convergence speed, a distributed edge caching algorithm based on deep Q-network (DQN) was considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. However, most centralized learning algorithms are prone to over-utilization of storage, which can significantly consume network communications resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, centralized training requires users to upload their data to the cloud server, and data security of users may therefore be compromised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, distributed learning approaches do not need data transfer, but require a large amount of cache and action space, which represents a great challenge for edge servers with limited storage and computation resources in F-RANs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), as a special machine learning architecture, can protect user privacy by sharing the training model without requiring users to provide their own data.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a cooperative caching strategy based on federated deep reinforcement learning to find the optimal caching policy in F-RANs.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the authors studied the training problem of FL algorithm in wireless networks and analyzed the effect of transmit power on the training efficiency of FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an adaptive asynchronous FL mechanism to change intelligently the number of local update models for achieving global model aggregation.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the researchers trained a two-timescale RL model by using FL in a distributed manner, in order to achieve real-time and low-overhead computation offloading and resource allocation strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Model transfer in FL, however, can also consume a high amount of communications resources. In the above literature, the communications efficiency problem of FL was not analyzed.
To improve the communications efficiency and reduce the communications cost of FL framework, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed two methods to reduce the upstream communications cost: structured updates and sketch updates. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an FL approach with periodic averaging and quantified communications to address the communications efficiency and scalability challenges. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, the researchers proposed a sparse-valued compression framework to meet the special requirements of FL environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Model computation and communications transmission are two major factors that influence the efficiency of FL. Current intelligent edge devices are equipped with abundant computing resources. The local training of an FL model takes only a few milliseconds, while model transmission takes several seconds, which is influenced by the network bandwidth and the participants distribution of FL. The cross-territory participants make the communications delay of FL grow larger. How to effectively improve the training efficiency and communications efficiency of FL without degrading the model performance has become a key to whether the FL model can be deployed practically.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, in order to address the formulated cache optimization problem, we propose an FRLQ-based cooperative caching policy. First, dueling DQN is used to solve the cache update problem of single F-AP. Then, we deploy an FL framework between the cloud server and the edge layer to achieve collaborative training of local models from multiple F-APs. Subsequently, we quantify the uploaded local model from each F-AP to compress model parameters so as to improve the communications efficiency of the FL framework. Finally, we analyze the global convergence and computational complexity of the proposed policy.</p>

Compared with traditional DQN, dueling DQN can solve the reward over-estimation problem and the reward bias problem of DQN, and has strong decision-making ability.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Few problems arise in the above proposed cooperative caching policy based on dueling DQN in single F-AP. Firstly, when the state feature space is small and the training data is limited, it is very challenging to build a high quality content caching policy based on RL. Transfer learning approaches can build a high-performance RL model by transferring experience, parameters, or gradients from learned tasks to new tasks. However, the privacy of data or models in many privacy-aware applications usually does not allow directly transferring data or models from one agent to another. Secondly, it needs to take a long time to train a good RL agent in single F-AP. Meanwhile, the separate training of individual F-AP agents can also cause an additional waste of resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the above problems, in this subsection, we propose FRLQ to implement cooperative caching between the cloud server and the edge layer. By sharing the same DRL model between multiple F-APs and the cloud server, it can solve the problem that the samples are too small for DRL model training in single F-AP. At the same time, the proposed policy allows user data to stay in the local F-AP without sharing with the cloud server for training, which protects the users’ privacy. However, transmission of massive model parameters brings about the communications efficiency problem for FL. To improve the communications efficiency, on one hand, we prune and quantize the shared DRL model. On the other hand, we periodically perform global model aggregation to increase the communications interval and reduce the communications rounds. Therefore, the proposed FRLQ consists of three modules: (1) network pruning, (2) quantization and weight sharing, and (3) periodical global aggregation.</p>

We use pruning and quantization methods to compress the shared DRL models to reduce the amount of model transmission parameters and lighten the network load. We execute periodic global model aggregation to increase the communications interval and reduce the communications rounds, which further improve the communications efficiency.</p>

We perform pruning and quantization on the shared model, which ensures that our model is lightweight and easy to deploy.

It can be seen that the loss curve decreases rapidly as the number of training steps increases. After enough training steps, the loss converges to a stable state. Compared with the traditional FRL-based caching policy, the proposed caching policy is less stable at the beginning of model training. The model parameters change a lot at the beginning of model training, and the proposed policy further quantizes and compresses the model to make it lighter, so the model converges slowly. We can also see that the proposed policy converges when the training steps reach 400 or more.</p>

As the period increases, the uploaded model parameters decrease slowly. The reason is that as the period increases, the model gradually converges. The weight update amount of each layer of the model becomes smaller and smaller, and the uploaded parameters participating in the global model update also decrease.</p>

The reason is that the RL-based caching policies have fewer samples to learn in the replay memory at the beginning of the training process. As the time slot increases and the learning samples accumulate, the performance of the RL-based policies is significantly better than that of LFU and LRU. We can also see that the cache hit rate of the proposed policy grows significantly faster than that of the FRL-based caching policy. The reason is that the proposed policy only needs 60% of the latter on the number of uploaded parameters, which can be seen from the Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV Simulation Results ‣ A Federated Reinforcement Learning Method with Quantization for Cooperative Edge Caching in Fog Radio Access Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. The proposed policy significantly reduces the network load and makes the network cache update faster, and the cache hit rate of F-AP also increases rapidly.</p>

We can also observe that although the number of model parameters of the proposed policy is significantly reduced, the cache hit rate is however significantly higher than that of LFU and LRU, and only slightly lower than that of the FRL-based caching policy and the centralized DRL-based caching policy.</p>

In LFU, the F-AP updates contents according to the requested frequency. In LRU, the F-AP updates contents according to whether the content has been recently requested.
The two caching schemes ignore cooperative caching among multiple F-APs in the network.
For the centralized DRL-based caching policy, all content cache updates are uniformly scheduled by the cloud server. And the users’ data will be uploaded to the cloud server, which threatens the data security.
This policy is also difficult to deploy in reality, because the load pressure on backhaul links is relatively large. On the contrary, the proposed policy uploads significantly fewer parameters for the global model update, whereas it achieves almost the same performance as the FRL-based caching policy. Obviously, the proposed caching policy is more lightweight to deploy.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed the federated reinforcement learning method with quantization for cooperative edge caching in F-RANs. Considering the dynamic network environment, we have formulated the cooperative caching problem as an MDP. We have deployed dueling DQN in each F-AP to find the optimal caching policy by learning the user request behavior and content popularity. We have also established an FL framework between the edge layer and the cloud server.
Local DRL models from multiple F-APs can be trained collaboratively through the FL framework.
On one hand, it avoids the data security problem caused by directly transmitting data of users to the cloud server. On the other hand, it solves the problem of insufficient samples for training a DRL model in single F-AP. Finally, the uploaded local model has been quantized to make the model lighter, which reduces the network transmission pressure.
Furthermore, we have also demonstrated the global convergence and low time complexity of the proposed policy.
Simulation results have shown that the proposed policy achieves almost the same performance as the benchmark schemes, and is more lightweight and easy to deploy.
Future work will explore the joint optimization of user request delay and model transfer delay in F-RANs.</p>
