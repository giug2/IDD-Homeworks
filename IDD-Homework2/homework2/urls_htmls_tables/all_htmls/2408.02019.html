<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) aims to acquire customized models for each client without disclosing raw data by leveraging the collective knowledge of distributed clients. However, the data collected in real-world scenarios is likely to follow a long-tailed distribution. For example, in the medical domain, it is more common for the number of general health notes to be much larger than those specifically related to certain diseases.
The presence of long-tailed data can significantly degrade the performance of PFL models. Additionally, due to the diverse environments in which each client operates, data heterogeneity is also a classic challenge in federated learning. In this paper, we explore the joint problem of global long-tailed distribution and data heterogeneity in PFL and propose a method called Expert Collaborative Learning (ECL) to tackle this problem. Specifically, each client has multiple experts, and each expert has a different training subset, which ensures that each class, especially the minority classes, receives sufficient training. Multiple experts collaborate synergistically to produce the final prediction output. Without special bells and whistles, the vanilla ECL outperforms other state-of-the-art PFL methods on several benchmark datasets under different degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, deep learning technology has made incredible progress in various fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
A common way of constructing deep learning models involves collecting training data from various devices and training the models on a specific server.
However, with growing concerns about the security of user data privacy, centralized training methods are not suitable for certain cross-organizational collaborative training tasks.
Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> has emerged as a distributed machine learning framework, allowing collaborative training of models across multiple clients while safeguarding user data privacy.
In FL, data is stored locally on each client and cannot be directly transmitted. Instead, the global model serves as the initialization model of each client, flowing among these clients. Updates from clients are then aggregated to obtain the global model for the next round on the server side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
FL aims to optimize a global model that can be regarded as an “average” across all clients.
However, during FL training, one major practical challenge is data heterogeneity. Local data generated or collected by different clients may come from various sources, which results in diverse distribution between clients. In this case, training a single global model may struggle to efficiently adapt to the diverse data distributions across all clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, many works have delved into attaining “personalized models” for each client to alleviate potential client drift caused by heterogeneous data and most of them can achieve excellent personalized performance for each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
However, these methods typically assume a balanced global data distribution. In real-world applications, collected data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where most classes have very few samples (referred to as tailed classes), while a few classes contain the majority of samples (referred to as head classes) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. It is reasonable to take into account the presence of a long-tailed distribution in PFL.
In a PFL setting characterized by both data heterogeneity and a globally long-tail distribution, the majority of clients often are in extremely imbalanced states. This imbalance leads to a significant decline in the overall performance of personalized models.
Specifically, due to data heterogeneity, there may be significant differences in the imbalance distribution among different clients. The imbalance rates or minority classes may vary across clients and diverge from the global distribution.
In this case, the global model is underrepresented in global-tailed classes due to the scarcity of samples and can only contribute limited knowledge to PFL models in identifying global-tailed classes. In addition, PFL models may also overfit some classes with a small number of samples of each client, resulting in poor PFL model performance.
So, it becomes exceptionally challenging to learn personalized models in the PFL setting with long-tailed data, especially for the tailed classes.
FedAFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposes to utilize the data from the majority classes of each client to generate adversarial features for its minority classes.
Although it provides a solution for PFL on the joint problem, its performance is severely affected by the network architecture and layers employed for adversarial augmentation, resulting in weak robustness.
Furthermore, due to privacy considerations, the global long-tailed distribution is unknown.
Many long-tailed learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> cannot be directly employed to tackle this issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose an Expert Collaborative Learning (ECL) framework to address the joint problem of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution in PFL.
Importantly, our method does not necessitate additional information beyond the standard FL setup, such as the label distribution for each client, ensuring privacy security to a large degree.
Specifically, we allocate multiple expert models to each client, and each expert is assigned a distinct training subset. Compared to the degree of imbalance in the corresponding client, the imbalance within each expert is relatively smaller, which enables each class to receive sufficient attention and training. Especially, minority classes can also become the dominant class for specific experts and be well-trained.
Each expert specializes in predicting specific categories. By combining the predictive strengths of each expert, we form the final prediction outputs.
Therefore, our approach is simple yet effective and demonstrates robustness to network architecture.
We conduct experiments on various heterogeneous and long-tailed benchmarks, and the results show that ECL outperforms the state-of-the-art PFL and long-tailed methods.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the non-IID data distribution among clients, the single global model cannot adapt to the distribution of each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
PFL can provide a customized model for each client. A series of works have been proposed about PFL, which are mainly two strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
The first strategy is <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Global Model Personalization</span>, whose aim is to personalize the trained global FL model through a local adaptation step.
Some methods, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, utilize data augmentation techniques to generate additional data for each client to produce an IID dataset. Another line of research focuses on the design of FL client selection mechanisms for sampling from a more homogeneous distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, Ditto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> adds a regularization term on the local optimization objective, which encourages the personalized models to be close to the optimal global model.
FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposes to keep the Batch Normalization layers on the client and exclude it from federated aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The second strategy is <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Learning Personalized Models</span>, aiming to modify the FL model aggregation process.
The parameter decoupling method is an intuitive and effective approach in PFL. It entails partitioning the overall model parameters into global and personalized components. Personalized parameters are trained locally on the clients and are not shared with the FL server.
FedPer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> retains the classifier parameters as personalized parameters and the parameters of the feature extractor as globally shared parameters.
Instead, LG-FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> shares the global classifier parameters and retains the feature extractor as personalized parameters.
PFLEGO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> is based on the framework of FedPer and improves the optimization process.
CD2-pFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> uses channel decoupling to divide model parameters into global and personalized ones by channel.
pFedLA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> leverages hypernetworks to train layer aggregation parameters for each client to acquire personalized models.
Additionally, PFL methods based on knowledge distillation, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, achieve promising performance by acquiring a stronger global model or directly assisting in obtaining improved personalized models.
However, these methods assume a balanced global data distribution. When the global distribution follows a long-tailed pattern, the insufficient samples for tail classes result in inadequate learning for these classes, leading to a sharp decline in the performance of personalized models.
Recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> have been proposed to deal with Federated long-tailed problems.
However, the personalized federated long-tailed problem is still an area that requires further exploration.
Though FedAFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> has been proposed to solve the problem of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution in PFL through feature augmentation, it is severely affected by the network architecture and layers used for adversarial augmentation. In this paper, we explore this issue and provide a simple yet effective algorithm for tackling it through expert collaboration.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Long-tailed visual recognition aims to improve the accuracy of tailed classes while minimizing the damage to the accuracy of head classes. <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Re-balancing</span> is the most common practice in long-tailed visual recognition, which aims to re-balance the distribution by over-sampling tailed classes, under-sampling head classes, or re-weighting the cost function according to the frequency or importance of samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Specifically, BBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> finds that the re-balancing method would damage the classifier learning to a certain extent and provides a bilateral branch network to remedy it.
Other methods include <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adopting logit adjustment</span> by post-processing the model prediction according to class frequencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
cRT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> improved the model’s performance by decoupling the model into feature learning and classifier learning to obtain better representation learning. Moreover,
<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data augmentations</span> can help re-balance the distribution by transferring head classes information to tailed classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, generating tailed classes’ features by estimating the distribution of tailed classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, or using prior knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. The current methods based on augmentation can be divided into sample level and feature level. SHIKE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> fuses the features of the shallow parts and the deep part in each expert to improve representation in the first stage and utilizes the balanced softmax cross-entropy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> to retrain the classifier in the second stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, methods based on a mixture of experts (MoE) have shown the potential to improve performance by leveraging the knowledge of multiple models. LFME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> divides long-tailed data into different groups for different experts to reduce the imbalance.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the limited data on each client, which is insufficient for training a high-performance model individually, personalized federated learning is based on federated training. It aims to utilize the knowledge of other clients to help train personalized models while protecting the privacy of each client’s data.
ECL is a simple yet effective method based on FedAvg to help train personalized expert models by fully utilizing the backbone network of the global model as a carrier of ”knowledge” for other clients.
It is based on the following intuitions.
Firstly, the global model is trained indirectly on all local datasets, which results in better generalization and robustness than training on each client’s local data alone. Second, the classifier is more negatively affected by long-tailed distributions, while the impact on the feature extractor’s representational ability is less <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. This observation holds in federated learning of heterogeneous and long-tailed distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Leveraging the backbone network of the global model obtained through the FedAvg method is both reasonable and feasible in the training process of personalized models. Additionally, our approach is orthogonal to the training of the global model, where FedAvg can also be substituted with other methods capable of obtaining superior feature representations.</p>

ECL consists of two stages. In Phase I, we leverage FedAvg to obtain a converged global model. In Phase II, we aim to acquire personalized expert models.
Specifically, we assign multiple expert models for each client, with these expert models sharing the same architecture as the global model, only reusing the backbone network of the global model. We sort each client’s data based on sample count in descending order and sequentially divide it into different groups, each serving as the training dataset for the corresponding expert.
In this context, each expert exhibits a notably smaller degree of imbalance when compared to the imbalance present within the corresponding client, which ensures adequate training for every class.
Particularly, minority classes also have the potential to become the dominant class for a specific expert, receiving more attention and effective training.
The global model exhibits good generalization and robustness, but its classifier is more attuned to the global data distribution. Hence, we retrain the classifier of the global model. During the inference process, we combine the predicted logits from the retrained classifier of the global model with the predicted logits from multiple expert models to obtain the final prediction output.
Next, three key steps in ECL, namely, Data Grouping, Personalized Multi-Expert Model Optimization, and Multi-expert Output Aggregation in the inference stage, will be elucidated in detail.</p>

It can be seen that ECL with both two and three expert models achieve similar superior performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art PFL methods. Among them, using two expert models yielded the best results, primarily because, with highly heterogeneous data and long-tail distributions where each client has fewer categories, employing two expert models adequately ensures comprehensive training for each class within the local client.
Local training unexpectedly achieves almost the worst results due to a lack of generalization performance. Other PFL methods may not yield the best results as they only consider the impact of data heterogeneity without considering the influence of long-tailed distribution. Although long-tailed methods applied to the framework of PFL achieve good performance, they still have a certain gap with ECL. FedAFA addresses the problems of long-tailed data in PFL through feature augmentation. However, the performance of FedAFA is not robust and is not as good as ECL.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed an Expert Collaboration Learning (ECL) framework to address the joint problems of heterogeneous and long-tailed data in PFL.
In highly heterogeneous long-tail data, there is a significant imbalance within each client, where minority class data tends to be overlooked, leading to an overall decline in personalized performance. We allocate multiple experts to each client, with each expert corresponding to a different training subset. Compared to the imbalance within the respective clients, this strategy significantly reduces the imbalance within each expert, ensuring that each class receives sufficient training and attention. Ultimately, we perform a weighted summation of the predicted logits from the global model and expert models to obtain the final prediction output.
Extensive experimental results show that ECL outperforms the state-of-the-art PFL methods under different settings.
