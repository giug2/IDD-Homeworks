<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the integration of flow-level and packet-level information for real-time intrusion detection remains a largely untapped area of research. This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the dynamic and increasingly complex landscape of cybersecurity, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a crucial role in protecting systems and networks from a wide range of cyber threats <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mallick and Nath, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>. The growing significance of cybersecurity is underscored by the rise in cyber-attacks driven by rapid digital expansion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mwangi, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite>. In an era marked by unprecedented interconnectedness and technological advancement, the cybersecurity landscape faces an escalating challenge: the relentless wave of cyber threats targeting critical infrastructures, sensitive information, and the core functions of society <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Farrukh et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024a</a>)</cite>. As the digital landscape expands, so does the complexity and sophistication of cyber-attacks, necessitating a paradigm shift in defensive strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cunningham, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. According to Gartner, by 2025, 30% of businesses in critical infrastructure will face a security breach, potentially leading to the shutdown of mission-critical cyber-physical systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gartner, Inc., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, highlighting the critical need for improved defensive measures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional machine learning-based NIDS methodologies can be broadly categorized into two types: those that analyze flow information and those that scrutinize packet-level information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Farrukh et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. Flow-based NIDS analyze aggregated data about network traffic, such as the volume of data transferred between endpoints, the duration of connections, and the frequency of interactions. This approach is efficient for identifying patterns and anomalies at a higher level, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are characterized by unusually high volumes of traffic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Specht and Lee, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>. However, flow-based systems can miss more nuanced attacks that are embedded within the payload of individual packets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Umer et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Conversely, packet-based NIDS focus on the contents of individual packets, examining payloads for signatures of known exploits, malware, and other malicious content. This method excels at detecting attacks that rely on specific payload characteristics, such as SQL injection or buffer overflow attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Farrukh et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Despite their detailed inspection capabilities, packet-based systems can be overwhelmed by high volumes of traffic and may fail to identify broader traffic patterns indicative of certain attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The inherent limitations of relying solely on either flow or packet-level information highlight the need for an integrated approach. Certain sophisticated attacks can exploit these limitations to bypass detection. For instance, an SQL injection attack, which embeds malicious SQL commands within a packet’s payload, might evade a flow-based NIDS because it does not generate significant anomalies in traffic patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Umer et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Conversely, flow-based attacks can slip through packet-level NIDS because they do not involve malicious payloads but rather manipulate the volume and frequency of packets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. This dichotomy underscores a critical gap in current machine learning-based NIDS technologies. By failing to leverage the complementary strengths of both flow and packet-level information, existing systems leave networks vulnerable to a range of attack vectors. Addressing this gap requires a novel approach that combines these two types of information into a unified framework, enabling more comprehensive threat detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these challenges, our paper proposes a novel method of multi-modal data fusion that integrates both flow and packet-level information, represented in a unique heterogeneous graph format. This approach leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to process and analyze the heterogeneous data, capturing the intricate relationships and patterns within network traffic. By representing network traffic as graphs, where nodes and edges encapsulate both flow and packet attributes, we can harness the strengths of both modalities of data. This fusion allows our system to detect a broader spectrum of cyber-attacks, improving overall detection accuracy. The graph-based representation also facilitates the learning of complex network patterns, which are essential for identifying sophisticated threats.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of contextual explainability in cybersecurity. Traditional NIDS outputs are often cryptic, making it difficult for cyber analysts to understand and respond to threats effectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abou El Houda et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. By integrating explainability using contexual information from large language models (LLMs), our approach provides clear, actionable insights into detected threats, detailing the nature of the attack, affected components, and recommended mitigation strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In short, this paper emphasizes the importance of data fusion in network security and proposes a novel framework that integrates flow and packet-level information using GNNs, along with contextual and explainable inferences. By bridging the gap between these two data modalities and leveraging their combined information, our approach offers a robust and comprehensive solution to network intrusion detection. This framework not only enhances the detection of threats but also provides actionable insights that can lead to the development of intelligent systems capable of making autonomous decisions on appropriate responses, thereby paving the way for improved cybersecurity measures.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we review the existing literature in two parts: the application of GNNs in NIDS and the role of XAI in the NIDS domain. Notably, there is a significant gap in the research concerning the integration of packet-level and flow-level information for both inference and explainability. Our work aims to address this gap by leveraging data fusion through heterogeneous graph structures, extracting contextual information from both packet and flow levels, and performing graph-level classification to enable real-time inference with explainability. This comprehensive approach not only enhances the detection capabilities but also provides actionable insights, advancing the field of network security.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The majority of the existing literature on GNN-based NIDS focuses on node-level and edge-level classification. These studies are primarily aimed at analyzing historical network traffic to understand past attacks or to visualize network activity in a more user-friendly manner, often lacking real-time inference capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Messai and Seba, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. Further, most of these works employ homogeneous graph representations of network traffic, which do not fully exploit the heterogeneous nature of network data. This leaves a gap in leveraging the heterogeneity of network traffic and providing real-time inference. We discuss several notable works herein, highlighting their contributions and limitations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Lo et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> presented "E-GraphSAGE" to classify network flows using edge-level classification. The model captures edge and topological information in IoT networks for classification. The authors enhanced the GraphSAGE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hamilton et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> algorithm to directly exploit the structural information of the network flow and encode it in a graph. Despite these advancements, the scalability and real-time inference capabilities remain questionable due to the computational complexity of analyzing complete flow information. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Chang and Branco (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite> further enhanced E-GraphSAGE by integrating residual learning and an attention mechanism to increase efficiency. They utilized E-GraphSAGE with residual learning to target minority class imbalance and introduced an edge-based residual graph attention network (E-ResGAT) to improve efficiency. However, the reliance on fixed neighborhood edge sampling and attention mechanisms might still face challenges in highly dynamic network environments.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhou et al. (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposed a supervised approach based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and network traces. They considered only the topological structure of the graph, omitting edge features and initializing node features as a vector of ones. This method can efficiently handle large graphs but may miss critical edge information that could enhance detection accuracy. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> suggested using a GCN for botnet detection. They used 12 GCN layers to capture long-term dependencies in large botnet architectures. However, very deep GCN models are prone to over-smoothing, which can diminish the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> presented a comprehensive GNN-based NIDS model capable of capturing relations in the network graph and combining both node and edge features to identify abnormal traffic behavior. This approach uses IP addresses and port numbers to represent Internet of Things (IoT) sessions as nodes and network flows as edges, which helps mitigate multiple attack vectors at the application and network layers. However, attacks dependent on payload content can still evade detection. A more general approach to detecting intrusions with a heterogeneous graph is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pujol-Perich et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. The graph is built based on network flows, creating separate nodes for the source host, destination host, and the flow itself. This structure, combined with a nonstandard message-passing neural network (MPNN), improves the model’s ability to learn embeddings from flows. Despite its promising accuracy, the model was tested on a heavily pre-processed dataset, raising questions about its performance on more balanced and varied data.</p>

While this approach effectively captures temporal dynamics, its applicability to a wider range of attacks remains to be seen. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Premkumar et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> is the only paper we found that effectively integrates both flow and packet information utilizing Graph Representation Learning (GRL). Their approach first generates packet-level embeddings from graph representations, then combines these with flow-level features for final prediction. While this method captures detailed packet information and broader flow characteristics, it lacks direct fusion of these features, potentially leading to increased computational overhead due to the two-step processing required.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In short, while existing GNN-based NIDS models offer various methods for network intrusion detection, they often focus on either node or edge-level classification and typically lack the integration of heterogeneous information sources. Our proposed approach addresses these shortcomings by leveraging both packet and flow-level data within a heterogeneous graph framework, enabling more comprehensive and real-time intrusion detection. By utilizing graph-level classification, our model can better capture the complex relationships inherent in network traffic and provide robust defense mechanisms against a broader range of cyber threats.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">XAI holds promise in enhancing the adoption of machine learning (ML) models within existing cybersecurity frameworks. However, several challenges still need to be addressed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nadeem et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, particularly in making explanations more understandable for users and reducing the opacity of ML models within NIDS frameworks. To address these issues, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alwahedi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite> explored the integration of LLMs with XAI techniques. Consequently, recent research papers have focused on adding an LLM layer to the existing frameworks.</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> introduced LLM-DTE (Large Language Model Decision Tree Explanations), a method that utilizes LLM to generate natural language explanations for decision tree-based NIDS. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Khediri et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite> proposed an approach that integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with LLMs to generate human-understandable explanations for detected anomalies.

<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite these advancements, significant issues remain regarding the scalability, efficiency, and human-centric aspects of XAI-driven cybersecurity solutions. Current explanations based on SHAP values often lack the necessary contextual and temporal information, which is crucial for accurately identifying and explaining time-based attacks. Time-based attacks, such as DDoS attacks, unfold over specific periods, where the timing and sequence of network events are quite important. A more effective explanation would incorporate temporal information, with features highlighting a rapid influx of requests to the targeted server from specific IPs within a brief timeframe, providing a clearer understanding of why the attack was detected.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Explaining payload-specific attacks based on network flow remains a challenge. The actual signature of payload-specific attacks, such as SQL injection, lies within the payload itself. These attacks can demonstrate benign behavior in network flow, with their malicious intent residing in the packet content. Thus, explanations must consider the payload to clearly convey why a prediction was made. Current methods that explain such attacks solely based on flow data fail to capture the critical details within the payload, leading to incomplete or inaccurate explanations. These shortcomings are addressed in this paper by enhancing the feature extraction process to include both contextual and temporal information for time-based attacks, and by ensuring payload-specific attacks are explained based on their content.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed framework ”XG-NID” presents a novel approach to network intrusion detection by integrating flow and packet-level information into a heterogeneous graph structure, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of network behavior. This fusion of multiple data modalities enhances the model’s ability to capture complex interactions within the network, leading to more accurate and effective intrusion detection. Moreover, the framework not only provides performant detection capabilities but also delivers detailed, human-readable explanations and potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights generated are both actionable and understandable. The framework is composed of six key components, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Explainable Artificial Intelligence ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ XG-NID: Dual-Modality Network Intrusion Detection using a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Flow and Feature Generator is the first component of our proposed framework, responsible for processing raw network traffic and aggregating it into flows. The primary goal of this component is to extract features from raw network traffic for real-time inference. For our approach, we set a maximum limit of 20 packets per flow, following the work of the CIC-IoT2023 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Neto et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. The decision to limit the flow to 20 packets is driven by our objective to enable real-time inference; allowing flows to accumulate based on default parameters could result in flow durations of up to 30 minutes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Aouini and Pekar, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Additionally, we set an idle timeout of 120 seconds, meaning that if a flow remains inactive for this duration, it is concluded.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The Flow and Feature Generator also segregates packet-level information with respect to its corresponding flow, ensuring that each flow includes
payload information derived from its associated packets. This segregation is crucial for generating graph structures, as our objective is to unify flow and packet-level information into a cohesive representation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Built upon NFStream <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Aouini and Pekar, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, the Flow and Feature Generator computes 76 flow-level features and 14 packet-level features. The primary focus of the packet features is to capture the payload information, which is crucial for detecting payload-specific attacks.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Once the flows and their respective features are generated, the Flow and Feature Generator transforms the payload of each packet within a flow into a uniform feature space of 1500 features. This transformation is based on the method outlined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Farrukh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, where the payload of each packet is represented by 1500 features derived from the bytes of the payload. The hexadecimal representation of each byte is converted into an integer ranging from 0 to 255, with each resulting integer forming one feature. In cases where the payload is shorter than 1500 bytes, zero padding is applied to maintain a consistent feature vector structure. For packets with no payload, the entire feature vector is padded with zeros.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Conventional features, developed by the first component, are typically effective for identifying volume-based attacks characterized by significant spikes in SYN requests or packet rates within a single flow but are less effective in detecting attacks that require understanding patterns across multiple flows. To address this limitation, the explainable feature extractor also extracts temporal features that capture statistics from previous flows. This approach involves analyzing the evolution of network flow statistics over time and identifying patterns across multiple flows. Techniques such as sliding window features, which aggregate statistics within specific time frames (e.g., connection attempts or packet rates over the last minute), provide a more comprehensive view of network activity and help identify deviations from normal behavior. Temporal correlation, which tracks the relationship between successive flows such as repeated scanning attempts from the same source, aids in identifying reconnaissance activities. By integrating these additional features, the detection system can better understand and explain the broader context of network traffic patterns, leading to a more performant approach for identifying and mitigating threats.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed approach for extracting additional features is illustrated in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.1.2 Explainable Feature Extractor ‣ 3.1 Proposed Framework ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ 2.2 Explainable Artificial Intelligence ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ XG-NID: Dual-Modality Network Intrusion Detection using a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. This approach leverages sliding window and temporal techniques to enhance the detection and explanation of cyber-attacks. As detailed in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.1.1 Flow and Feature Generator ‣ 3.1 Proposed Framework ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ 2.2 Explainable Artificial Intelligence ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ XG-NID: Dual-Modality Network Intrusion Detection using a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the algorithm tracks and calculates various rolling window-based temporal features for each destination machine. These temporal features are systematically updated over time and are then integrated with conventional flow features. The resulting set of metrics offers a comprehensive framework for network intrusion detection, improving both the accuracy and interpretability of the system’s predictions. This integration of temporal and flow-based features allows for a more dynamic and context-aware understanding of network behavior, which is crucial for identifying and explaining complex, time-based attacks.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fourth component in our system is the Integrated Gradient Explainer, which provides feature-based local explanations for each predicted outcome from the HGNN model. This explainer uses the Integrated Gradient approach to determine the contribution of each input feature to the network’s prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sundararajan et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. One of the primary advantages of Integrated Gradients is that it does not require any modification to the original network architecture. It is implemented with a few calls to the standard gradient operator, making it simple and efficient to use. Moreover, this method ensures that the attributions are accurate and meaningful, as it satisfies key theoretical principles that make the explanations reliable.</p>

This process begins by utilizing the output of the Integrated Gradients Explainer to assess the importance of heterogeneous graph features.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Conducting an apple-to-apple comparison for the proposed framework presents certain challenges, as our work is the first to fuse dual modalities—packet-level and flow-level information of network traffic—through a heterogeneous GNN, as per the authors knowledge. Consequently, comparing our framework with other approaches that solely utilize either flow-level or packet-level information may not provide an accurate assessment of its effectiveness. Furthermore, comparing our proposed HGNN with other graph-based approaches is also problematic, as the majority of existing works in NIDS utilizing GNNs focus on edge or node-level classification. These methods primarily aim at analyzing network traffic rather than providing real-time inference, as highlighted in Section 2.

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the standout aspects of our proposed framework is the fusion of dual modalities—packet-level and flow-level information—in network security. This multi-modal data fusion represents a significant innovation but also presents a challenge in evaluating our framework against other approaches, as the integration of both types of information is quite uncommon in the existing literature. Despite this, we identified a few state-of-the-art approaches that, in some capacity, utilize both packet-level and flow-level information, albeit through multiple steps or separate processes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One such approach is presented by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Premkumar et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, where the authors utilized packet-level information—specifically, the payload of packets—to compute embeddings of the packets within a flow. After generating these embeddings using a GNN, they combined the embeddings with respective flow features to perform classification, thereby leveraging dual modality. Another notable work by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Kiflay et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>)</cite> employs a two-step classification process. In their approach, two separate models are trained: one for flow-level information and another for packet-level information. This multimodal network traffic analysis approach, though effective, treats the modalities separately before combining them for final classification. Further, the TR-IDS framework proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Min et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> incorporates a multi-stage processing pipeline. It uses word embeddings and a Text-CNN to extract features from packet payloads, which are then combined with flow features for classification. While these methods represent significant strides in multi-modal network security, they all rely on multi-step or multi-process approaches to fuse the dual modalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, our proposed framework inherently fuses packet-level and flow-level information within a unified, heterogeneous graph structure, eliminating the need for additional processing steps. This seamless integration not only simplifies the processing pipeline but also enhances the model’s ability to detect sophisticated attacks that span both modalities. Moreover, our framework represents the first of its kind to fuse dual modalities through a heterogeneous graph, providing a novel and more holistic approach to network intrusion detection.</p>

The inherent fusion of packet-level and flow-level information in our model allows for more accurate and efficient classification, setting a new benchmark in network intrusion detection.

The Generative Explainer leveraged the top features identified by the previous component and provided a comprehensive response, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.SS1.SSS2" title="4.1.2 Dual-Modality State-of-the-Art ‣ 4.1.1 Baseline Comparisons ‣ 4.1 Performance Analysis ‣ 4 Results and Analysis ‣ 3.2.1 Dataset Preprocessing ‣ 3.2 Dataset ‣ 3.1.6 Generative Explainer ‣ 3.1.5 Integrated Gradient Explainer ‣ 3.1.4 Graph Neural Network Model ‣ 3.1.3 Graph Generator ‣ 3.1 Proposed Framework ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ 2.2 Explainable Artificial Intelligence ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ XG-NID: Dual-Modality Network Intrusion Detection using a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1.2</span></a>. The initial part of the response highlights the predicted attack using descriptive feature names. It clearly shows how an increase in ICMP packets within the specific timeframe suggests that the attacker is attempting to overwhelm the targeted system. The second part outlines the potential mitigation steps that can be taken to address such attacks.</p>

This limitation arises because individual flow attributes, such as acceptable packet size ranges, can be misleading when considered in isolation. In contrast, DDoS attacks are more effectively explained by analyzing the average behavior of packets over a specific timeframe rather than focusing on single flow attributes. This comparison highlights that the inclusion of our explainable features and the rolling window concept provides more accurate reasoning for flow-based attacks, making the responses generated by our proposed system significantly more meaningful.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work presented ”XG-NID,” a novel framework that advances the state-of-the-art in ML-based NIDS by integrating flow-level and packet-level data into a heterogeneous graph structure. By leveraging a HGNN for graph-level classification, XG-NID provides real-time inference capabilities while capturing the complex relationships inherent in network traffic. The incorporation of LLMs adds a layer of explainability, enabling the generation of human-readable explanations and actionable insights, which are critical for effective cybersecurity defense mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, the introduction of new flow features based on temporal information enhances the contextual understanding and explainability of the model’s predictions. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that XG-NID significantly outperforms existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods, achieving an impressive F1 score of 97% in multi-class classification. This underscores the efficacy of our approach in addressing the challenges of real-time intrusion detection while providing a robust and adaptive defense mechanism. Ultimately, XG-NID sets a new benchmark in the field of NIDS by combining innovative data fusion techniques with enhanced interpretability and real-time operational capabilities, offering a promising direction for future research and practical implementations in cybersecurity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Future work will focus on extending XG-NID to multiple datasets to ensure its robustness across diverse network environments. Additionally, we aim to integrate it into an automated system capable of making autonomous decisions and providing rapid security responses, paving the way for intelligent, self-sustaining cybersecurity solutions</p>
