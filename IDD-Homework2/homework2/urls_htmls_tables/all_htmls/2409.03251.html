<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals allows access to user intentions conveniently, which plays an important role in the fields of human-machine interaction. To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method. This study provides a new approach to high-performance EEG decoding, and has great potential for future CNN-Transformer based applications.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Brain-Computer/Machine interfaces (BCIS/BMIS) have garnered much attention over the past decades due to their outstanding ability to convert the users’ brain activity into machine-readable intentions or commands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Among various BCI modalities, noninvasive electroencephalograph (EEG) has the advantages of adequate temporal resolution, non-surgical electrode placements, and low cost, thus leading to its widest application in the fields of rehabilitation engineering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, cognitive science <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, neuroscience, and psychology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Various brain paradigms, such as the motor imagery (MI), event-related P300, and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), have been extensively studied by researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and a complete EEG-based BCI system generally consists of the user intention decoding process of the signal acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and a final application interface for the control signal convert. To gain an accurate interpreting of the sampled EEG, two main categories of recognition methods, traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and advanced deep learning (DL) techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, have been innovatively investigated. Traditional ML methods usually involve feature extraction and feature classifi-cation, where the former procedure uses algorithms of the common spatial pattern (CSP), Filter bank CSP, fast Fourier transform (FFT), wavelet transform, etc. As for the feature classification, the supervised learning approach (e.g., linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM)) and the unsupervised methods (e.g., K nearest neighbor (KNN)) have been shown to be effective. However, since features are manually extracted from the raw non-stationary EEG with low signal-to-noise ratio, the specific expertise is generally required, leading to the process being time-consuming and complicated. Worse more, the useful information may also be lost due to insufficient expert experience. The DL methods, on the other hand, allow end-to-end models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn the data representation automatically, thereby minimizing the need for human manual intervention and domain-specific preprocessing, and have already achieved excellent even the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in several domains such as computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically for the EEG decoding, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based ConvNet has reached comparable classification results to the traditional ML methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. A compact network called EEGNet has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which utilized depth wise and separable convolutions to build an EEG-specific model that capable of learning features across various tasks. Moreover, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN) has been developed by Tortora et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> for decoding the gait events from EEG, where the network’s ability to handle the time-dependent information was fully leveraged. However, despite these commendable advances, CNNs and RNNs are not perfect in processing EEG signals. More specifically, while CNNs are good at learning local features, it is difficult to obtain long-term dependencies across the whole data scale. RNNs, on the other hand, are also prone to difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies in long sequence data. Therefore, to address these shortcomings, the research processing for sequence signals is gradually shifting to the self-attention mechanism, which allows each element in a sequence to be processed taking into account the relationship with all other elements, thus capturing richer contextual features. Moreover, the multi-feature analysis of EEG has also increasingly attracted attention considering that the sampled signals contain multi-dimensional features of the temporal, spectral, and spatial domains.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most famous models based on the self-attention mechanism is the Transformer model, which has recently been attempted to EEG decoding. Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> introduced a novel approach by integrating the multi-head attention mechanisms with CNNs for motor imagery tasks, and the various positional embedding techniques were used to improve the classification accuracy. As a result, the introduced five Transformer-based models have significantly outperformed existing models. Similarly, a compact hybrid model of CNNs and Transformers, named EEG Conformer, was developed to decode EEG signals by capturing both the local and global features, which was excelled on three public datasets and potentially established a new baseline for EEG processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The proposed ADFCNN in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> utilized the convolutions at two different scales to capture comprehensive spatial details in EEG data, and the features were fused through a self-attention mechanism. Moreover, Arjun <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Al-Quraishi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and Mulkey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> first converted the EEG data into time-frequency images, and then used Vision Transformers based on the idea of computer vision field. In the realm of pretrained models, different models of the BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, GPT and Swin Transformer model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> have been designed to transform the EEG into textual and visual formats for the further processing. Particularly, a Transformer-like recognition approach of Speech2EEG has been proposed to leverage the pretrained speech processing networks for the robust EEG feature aggregation, thereby boosting EEG signal analysis capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Given these above advancements, the promising potential of Transformers in EEG decoding has been well demonstrated.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, with the development of DL models, a single feature can no longer satisfy the requirement of the performance improvement for increasingly complex models in EEG decoding, and therefore, multi-feature analysis methods gradually occupy the mainstream of EEG analysis methods. In 2019, Tian et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> crafted a multi-view DL strategy that first transforming the raw data into representations in the frequency and time-frequency domains, then independently extracting the features, which were finally merged to perform classification tasks efficiently. The data from multiple frequency bands was used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> to create multi-view representations, where the spatial discrimination patterns of the views were learned by CNN, temporal information was aggregated by a variance layer, and the resultant features were classified by a fully connected layer. Recently, a multi-domain CNN model of TSFCNet was developed for MI decoding, which significantly outperformed the other traditional methods by extracting multi-scale features from the time domain and capturing the additional spatial, frequency, and time-frequency features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Earlier in this year, Liang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> developed an EISATC-Fusion model to leverage the multi-scale EEG frequency band information combined with the attention mechanism and temporal convo¬lutional networks (TCN) for an integrated feature extraction process. In addition, a lightweight multi-feature attention CNN was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> to extract the information from frequency, localized spatial domains, and feature maps to enhance the precision of EEG analysis, where a hybrid neural network of SHNN was designed to autonomously extract the spatial, spectral, and temporal features from EEG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In conclusion of these mentioned studies, the research community has tended to extract the temporal-spatial-spectral features simultaneously, which helps to improve the understanding and decoding effects of specific EEG signals. However, since the EEG signals are first collected and expressed in temporal domain, while the frequency/time-frequency/spatial features are represented or converted by various approaches, how to efficiently extract and integrate the features from different dimensions and establish a more robust extraction process still remain challenging.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned earlier, the application of Transformer-based and multi-feature analysis in EEG decoding has just emerged and is in a phase of continuous development, and there are few attempts to naturally combine the two. Since the convolutional networks-based models are able to automatically learn more discriminative local features from raw EEG data, while the attention-based Transformer adepts to describe the long-range dependencies, the combination of these two modules is envisioned to benefit each other for a more comprehensive interpretation of human user EEG data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Driven by this insight, in present work, a novel decoding architecture model with dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer, termed as Dual-TSST, is proposed to extract multi-dimensional features hidden in EEG while considering their global correlations. Specifically, the proposed architecture mainly consists of three parts of the feature extraction, feature fusion, and classification modules. The first feature extraction module is composed of two branches of convolutional neural networks to receive multi-view inputs from raw EEG and to extract the inherent temporal-spectral-spatial features. These obtained features are fed into the feature fusion module to be jointly concatenated and then to learn their global relationships by a Transformer, and a classifier composed of multilayer perceptron and global pooling layers is finally used to achieve the results output.

For the first module of the feature extraction, two branches based on convolutional neural networks are applied to sufficiently extract potential characteristics from the temporal, frequency, and spatial domain. Branch II, in particular, is uniquely designed to simultaneously analyze the wavelet-transformed time-frequency EEG data in two separate flip-flop formats, collecting the time-frequency-space features comprehensively.

<p id="S2.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">2) Data Augmentation: To mitigate the challenge of limited EEG data availability in decoding, several data augmentation strategies can be applied. Here the Segment and Reassemble (S&amp;R) mechanism is adopted. More specifically, each EEG sample from the same category and its corresponding time-frequency data are divided into a predetermined number of fixed segments (labeled <span id="S2.SS2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">R</span>). These segments are subsequently reconnected in various random orders that respect the original temporal sequence. This technique not only diversifies the training dataset but also enhances the model’s ability to generalize from limited data samples. Following the guidelines set forth in references <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, we generated augmented data in each epoch, matching the batch size, thereby ensuring consistent model training across different data permutations.</p>

Here, the Input 2 is obtained by subtly transposing Input 1 by 90 degrees. Unlike branch I of processing original EEG in a single line, branch II is actually perform simultaneous processing of multi-inputs. Specifically, the time convolution is applied first with a followed Batch normalization, which can be expressed as:</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The outcome of the Transformer Encoder maintains the same dimensional structure as its input. To effectively distill this complex data, global average pooling (GAP) is employed, which simplifies the feature map by averaging out the features over the entire spatial extent of each channel. This process extracts pivotal global information that is crucial for the next stage of processing.</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.p2.5" class="ltx_p">Following the pooling, the data is routed to an MLP module with two linear layers. The Softmax function, which normalizes the linear outputs to form a probability distribution over the predicted output classes, aids in the transformation of the pooled features into an M-dimensional vector. The model’s performance is evaluated using a cross-entropy loss function, which is essential for classification tasks and is mathematically represented as:</p>

Data were collected by 22 positioned Ag/AgCl electrodes according to international 10-20 system. To ensure signal quality, a 250 Hz sampling rate was utilized and the recorded data was filtered between 0.5 Hz and 100 Hz. The dataset includes two sessions, where the first session serves as the training set, and the second as the test set. Each session consists of six runs, with 48 trials per run that distributed evenly across task categories. In our study, we set the time window for each trial of this dataset between 2 and 6 seconds, and filtered the data using a frequency range from 0 to 40 Hz.</p>

Each subject participated in five sessions, where the initial two collected data without visual feedback and the subse¬quent three sessions included online feedback. Moreover, the dataset designates the initial three sessions (400 trials in total) for training and the final two (i.e., 320 trials) for testing.

Each subject underwent three experimental sessions, with data filtered through a 0-75 Hz band-pass filter. In addition, five-fold/ten-fold cross-validation techniques were involved in training. Also, a band-pass filter ranging from 0.5 Hz to 50 Hz was utilized on the SEED dataset, and the continuous data from each experiment was segmented into 1-second windows.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Specifically, from the model structure, it is apparent that the final feature size outputted by each branch is primarily governed by the kernel size and stride of the Average Pooling layer. For Branch I, a relative small convolution kernel is set to capture more granular features along the temporal dimension. However, despite richer details can be extracted, it may result in a larger feature map size. Using a larger Pooling Kernel size helps control the map size and the receptive field of the features. Meanwhile, it helps to reduce the computational requirements and enhance the model’s generalization capabilities while maintaining substantial contextual information. In contrast, a larger convolution kernel set in Branch II aims to capture broader features along the time-frequency dimension, and a following smaller Pooling Kernel Size may facilitate more intensive feature extraction. Indeed, balancing the convolution kernel sizes and pooling parameters between different branches enhances the model’s flexibility, which helps to better adapt to the model’s intrinsic structure and allow the model to learn features of different scales from different data types, thus improving model performance. Here, to balance the features obtained while enhancing the model performance, we set a larger Pooling Kernel size <math id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">P</mi><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑃</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">P_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> of 120 with a stride of <math id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P_{1}/10" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">P</mi><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1"><divide id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1"></divide><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝑃</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.3">1</cn></apply><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">P_{1}/10</annotation></semantics></math> for Branch I, and a smaller Pooling Kernel size <math id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">P</mi><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑃</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.3.m3.1c">P_{2}</annotation></semantics></math> of 64 with a stride of <math id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P_{2}/2" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml">P</mi><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1"><divide id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.1"></divide><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.2">𝑃</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.2.3">2</cn></apply><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.4.m4.1c">P_{2}/2</annotation></semantics></math> for Branch II.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we compared the relevant results of proposed model against a variety of innovative state-of-the-art methods, where ablation experiments also being involved to demonstrate the contribution of each model part. Finally, we illustrated the interpretability of the extracted features visually, which helps in understanding underlying principles of the model.
In general, for the selected datasets, the classification effect of existing deep learning has made great progress compared to machine learning. To avoid redundancy and ensure the persua¬siveness of the comparison, we mainly review the latest methods of the relevant datasets in the past three years, as well as some well-established deep learning techniques (e.g., ConvNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, EEGNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, FBCNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, EEG Conformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>). Among used methods, DRDA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> offers a sophisticated end-to-end domain adaptation approach tailored for EEG-based motor imagery classification tasks, and DAFS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> merges small sample learning with domain adaptation, enhancing domain-specific classification efficacy in MI-EEG tasks by leveraging source domain insights. EEG-ITNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> features an interpretable CNN framework that relies on inception modules and dilated causal convolutions, whereas IFNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> is a streamlined interactive convolutional network focusing on the interplay among various frequency signals to boost EEG feature depiction. MANN in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> integrates multiple attention mechanisms with transfer learning for EEG classification, and incorporates domain adaptation techniques to enhance its efficacy, while a multi-scale hybrid convolutional network of MSHCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> leverages convolu-tions across different dimen¬sions to distinctly extract temporal and spatial features from EEG data. In addition, several other latest models such as TSFCNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, Speech2EEG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, EISATC-Fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, FSA- TSP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, FTCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> have also been used for the evaluation.</p>

Specifically, the proposed Dual-TSST outperformed the existing SOTA methods in terms of overall average classification accuracy and the Kappa metrics, notably across subjects S1, S5, S6, and S7. In particular, compared with classical EEG decoding techniques like ConvNet and EEGNet, the average accuracy under current model has improved by 8.14% (p&lt;0.05) and 6.17% (p&lt;0.05), respectively, also with an obviously corresponding rise in Kappa values. Such the results underscore Dual-TSST’s enhanced capability for global feature extraction, as opposed to those local feature focus seen in ConvNet and EEGNet. Moreover, for the most test subjects, Dual-TSST achieved superior results over the FBCSP-inspired FBCNet and domain adaptation methods like DRDA and DAFS (p&lt;0.05), although being slightly inferior on S2 and S4. Compared to the models that introduced attention mechanisms into deep learning networks, such as Conformer, ADFCNN, and M-FANet, the developed Dual-TSST also showed better performance in most subjects’ accuracy, the average classifi¬cation accuracy, and the Kappa value. Among all the compared methods, the SHNN model excels in subjects S8 and S9, while being less accurate in S6. Overall, our proposed dual-TSST framework delivers varied improvements in the classification accuracy among different subjects within the Dataset I, and leads in terms of the average accuracy, and the Kappa metrics.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the binary classification Dataset II, as we see from Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV Results ‣ Dual-TSST: A Dual-Branch Temporal-Spectral- Spatial Transformer Model for EEG Decoding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, several additional models have been supplemented for the evaluation. Consequently, near the similar effects have been observed with those in Dataset I, where the dual-TSST not only surpasses conventional deep learning models such as ConvNet and EEGNet but significantly outperformed other advanced methods like DRDA, SHNN, Conformer, and ADFCNN, in almost all metrics (p&lt;0.05). In head-to-head comparisons with other leading techniques of MANN, TSFCNet, MSHCNN, and EISATC-Fusion, Dual-TSST consistently achieved superior average accuracy and Kappa values. Furthermore, the standard deviation values of the proposed dual-TSST in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV Results ‣ Dual-TSST: A Dual-Branch Temporal-Spectral- Spatial Transformer Model for EEG Decoding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> is 9.17, which is relatively lower to most of the compared methods. Such the result underscores the model’s robust generalization ability to deliver steady strong results for diverse subjects.</p>

Generally, the deeper models typically enhance the model’s representational ability and fit the data better. However, as the number of layers increases, issues such as the overfitting and gradient explosion may occur, along with an increase in computational costs. The accuracy trends with changes in number of Transformer layers are illustrated in Fig <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Parameter Sensitivity ‣ IV Results ‣ Dual-TSST: A Dual-Branch Temporal-Spectral- Spatial Transformer Model for EEG Decoding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, where we see that the introduction of the Transformer (from zero to one layer) may lead to a marked performance improvement. Besides, while initial increases in layers (i.e., from 0 to 4) enhance performance for both datasets, the accuracy associated with all datasets begins to decline after the fourth layer. This may indicate that the model has reached its learning saturation or is beginning to overfit the noise within the data. For Dataset I, the peak accuracy with Dual-TSST exceeded the lowest by 4.36% (p&lt;0.01), and for Dataset II, the corresponding value is 2.03% (p&lt;0.05). These results suggest that while increasing the number of layers can enhance performance up to a certain limit, excessively high numbers may hinder training and increase the risk of overfitting.</p>

In particular, a substantial overlap of features between the feet and tongue, left- and right-hands can be apparently observed. This overlap indicates that while efficiently learning the properties of each category on the training data, the model exhibits poor generalization when exposed to unknown data, failing to discriminate between comparable classes. Conversely, the introduction of Transfor¬mer results in a dramatic improvement. As in t-SNE visualiza¬tion, the training set displays highly distinct and well-separated clusters, with each category occupying a clear, even non-overlapping region in low-dimensional space. This implies that the transformer module significantly improves the model’s capacity to describe diverse properties, resulting in a better defined distribution of categories. Importantly, the t-SNE visualization of the test set also exhibits considerable improvement, where the distinctions between hand features and other categories become more prominent. Especially in categories prone to confusion (such as left and right hand), the Transformer module significantly lowers overlap, highlighting its vital role in strengthening the model’s generalization performance and capacity to differentiate between comparable categories.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The statistical distribution of non-stationary EEG data varies across different subjects and recording sessions, making it challenging for BCI researchers to design a classifier with high accuracy and generalization capability. Borrowing the idea of machine learning with data flow of feature extraction, feature fusion, and classification, a novel efficient DL-framework that fully incorporates the CNN and Transformer is suggested in this study to handle the data processing of EEG signals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed dual-TSST model first leverages a dual-branch CNN structure, which accepts data from diverse perspectives, to dig the comprehensive representation of entailed features. In this configuration, Branch I is tasked with extracting spatio¬temporal features from raw EEG, while Branch II handles the spatio-temporal-frequency features from wavelet-transformed data. The Transformer module further explores the long-range global dependencies and synthesizes all the diverse features into a cohesive feature set, which is finally classified by the classification module. For the proposed dual-TSST framework, minimal yet critical preprocessing with band-pass filtering, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, is needed to EEG signals, which avoids the specific sophisticated data preprocessing steps. In essence, such the proposed DL model does not require the extra expert knowledge but can automatically extract the comprehensive spatio-temporal-frequency features, which is conducive to the identification from multifaceted data sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Experimentally, the framework was evaluated through two BCI Competition IV Datasets of 2a, 2b, and one widely used emotional Dataset of SEED, where the superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods has been achieved. In general, extensive parameter sensitivity and ablation studies affirm that each component significantly contributes to the model’s effectiveness, particularly highlighting the substantial impact of pointwise dimension and Transformer. Particularly, the number of Transformer layers, which also being termed as the depth in other related studies, directly influences the model’s classification result, highlighting the importance of such the module introduction. More importantly, our specific results of Fig. 5 reveal the instructive suggestion for subsequent layer configuration of future transformer-based EEG decoding. Conversely, the number of heads in the multi-head attention setup showed marginally impact on the final performance, and such insensitivity may aid in the lightweight iterative design of future models. Moreover, the effects of the related branches and data augmentation have also been intuitively presented, thus clarifying the rationality of the developed framework.</p>

The majority of the parameters in current model originates from the comprehensive Transformer module and the fully connected layers for the classification, which coincides with the prior research of EEG Conformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Although depthwise separable convolutions were applied to mitigate this issue, current model still maintains a higher parameter count. Second, as the deep learning model, the number of samples for the focused data is expected to be large enough. While the data augmentation strategies can be strategically adopted as current work, one should maintain the quest for more effective source data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Since it is expensive, not-friendly, and impractical to always collect a larger number of recording data, several advanced methods, such as the transfer learning based domain adaptation, which uses knowledge from source subjects to improve the performance of a targeted one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, ought to be applied toward all accessible data. Moreover, only the subject-specific based experiments are conducted in this study, while more cross-subjects validation should be focused to further investigate the generalizability of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To sum up, the developed innovative architecture leverages the distinct strengths of related data types to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the decoding process, while also improving network interpretability through obeying ML-based processing flow. Moving forward, our objectives will focus on optimizing the model’s architecture and reducing its parameter footprint, alongside exploring online potential applications.</p>
