<p id="id39.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a promising collaborative and privacy-preserving machine learning approach in data-rich smart cities. Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity of these urban environments presents a significant challenge in selecting trustworthy clients for collaborative model training. The usage of traditional approaches, such as the random client selection technique, poses several threats to the system’s integrity due to the possibility of malicious client selection. Primarily, the existing literature focuses on assessing the trustworthiness of clients, neglecting the crucial aspect of trust in federated servers. To bridge this gap, in this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses the mutual trustworthiness in federated learning by considering the trust needs of both the client and the server. Our approach entails: (1) Creating preference functions for servers and clients, allowing them to rank each other based on trust scores, (2) Establishing a reputation-based recommendation system leveraging multiple clients to assess newly connected servers, (3) Assigning credibility scores to recommending devices for better server trustworthiness measurement, (4) Developing a trust assessment mechanism for smart devices using a statistical Interquartile Range (IQR) method, (5) Designing intelligent matching algorithms considering the preferences of both parties. Based on simulation and experimental results, our approach outperforms baseline methods by increasing trust levels, global model accuracy, and reducing non-trustworthy clients in the system.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">T</span>he concept of smart cities is gaining popularity day by day. This is driven by the fact that urban regions now host more than half of the global population. Projections from the World Bank indicate that this urban population will reach 6 billion by 2045 <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview</span></span></span>. Smart cities rely on data collected from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the number of IoT devices globally is estimated to reach approximately 41.6 billion by 2025 <span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>https://www.idc.com/</span></span></span>. This data abundance offers businesses opportunities to enhance production processes and strategic decision-making, boosting profitability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, the prevailing data analysis method often involves offloading data of smart devices to edge servers for training and pattern extraction. This approach encounters scalability challenges given the exponential growth of smart city devices and data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break">To address these challenges, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution to communication and privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. FL enables model training tasks to be executed locally, at the device level, and through distributed methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In this process, the federated server initially creates a machine-learning model and communicates its weights to a selected group of client devices during each communication round. Clients perform model training on their local data and provide updated weights to the federated server, which aggregates them to construct a new global model. This iterative process continues until a specific number of training rounds or the desired accuracy is reached <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break">The distributed nature of data in smart cities drives the adoption of FL, aligning with data localization and privacy needs. FL handles data growth, offering scalability, resource efficiency, resilience, real-time adaptability, and latency reduction. It taps into the potential of edge devices, ensuring system resilience even in node failure scenarios. In summary, FL addresses challenges posed by distributed datasets, enhancing privacy and scalability while unlocking the potential of smart city initiatives.
Nevertheless, given the heterogeneous nature of devices in smart cities, it is a challenging task to select a trustworthy set of clients to cooperate and work within the model training during federated learning rounds. The usage of traditional approaches, such as the random client selection technique, would pose several threats to the integrity of the system. This is due to the possibility of selecting malicious clients which can target the system with attacks such as poisoning attacks. These attacks can degrade the accuracy of the final global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Current literature often focuses on assessing client trust while neglecting trust in federated servers and primarily targets bootstrapping the process rather than addressing newcomer IoT device challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces a novel framework for bilateral client selection in federated learning environments in the domain of smart cities. The advantage of the approach stems from the fact that it considers the trustworthiness of both entities in the environment, i.e., the federated servers, as well as the clients. The goal is to enhance the security, reliability, and efficiency of the federated learning system while unlocking the full potential of smart cities. The main challenge lies in assessing the client’s trust without directly accessing the smart devices’ internals. The approach addresses this through a method based on resource monitoring and statistical IQR score analysis. We assume that by monitoring client device resource utilization, abnormal behaviour or performance deviations can raise concerns about trustworthiness. In addition, the reputation of the federated servers is also a crucial factor, which leads to the use of a reputation-based recommendation system in the environment. This system evaluates and recommends trustworthy federated servers based on past performance, integrity, and reliability while introducing a credibility score for recommending devices; by considering the trustworthiness of both clients and the federated servers, the proposed framework targets to create a robust and secure federated learning ecosystem in the realm of smart cities. This approach addresses concerns related to data privacy, security breaches, and biased learning outcomes, fostering trust and confidence among federated learning parties.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Performing federated learning training tasks on smart devices can provide substantial advantages. Nonetheless, adopting an unsupervised client selection approach, as per the standard federated learning model<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, has drawbacks for a plethora of reasons. First, the inclusion of untrustworthy clients can significantly degrade the performance of the overall system. Untrustworthy devices may engage in malicious activities, such as injecting bogus data into the local training process, which can lead to skewed models and reduced accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This not only undermines the effectiveness of the federated learning approach but also compromises the privacy and security of the system. Second, While existing research primarily focuses on assessing the trustworthiness of clients, this process is usually single-sided, as it often neglects the potential untrustworthy effects of servers, particularly in scenarios involving payment or data disclosure. In such contexts, servers can pose a threat to the confidentiality and integrity of client data. Overlooking this aspect of trust leaves the federated learning system vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access. To create a more comprehensive and robust trust framework, we believe that it is essential to consider the trustworthiness of both clients and servers.
Furthermore, allowing the servers to assign trust values to themselves is also a challenging task since the servers might act mischievously and assign high scores deliberately. Such factors ensure that the trustworthiness of federated servers poses a significant challenge and should not be neglected. However, the absence of a comprehensive trust assessment framework hinders the widespread adoption of federated server infrastructures in smart cities. In our prior research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, we addressed the challenge of selecting clients in federated learning, taking into account client incentives (rewards) and enhancing the accuracy of the global model on federated servers. In this study, we propose that trust scores for all participants in a federated learning system should take a crucial role in the decision-making process. Consequently, we have created a mechanism to foster trust between smart devices and federated servers, which facilitates mutual trust establishment and authentication between these two parties.</p>

In this paper, we introduce a novel mutual trust selection approach for federated learning within smart city environments. Our approach relies on a combination of reputation-based recommendation systems, statistical IQR trust-establishing methods, and matching game theory. The reputation-based recommendation system evaluates and recommends trustworthy federated servers based on past performance, integrity, and reliability while introducing a credibility score for recommender devices. The IQR method is applied to evaluate the trustworthiness of smart devices based on resource usage. Finally, the adoption of matching game theory allows the clients and the federated servers to choose each other by preferences, taking into account trustworthiness. Consequently, smart devices will play a role in determining their preferred federated server based on the server’s level of trust and vice versa.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In a recent study by authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, FLTrust was proposed to mitigate the presence of malicious clients in federated learning. Unlike conventional byzantine-robust techniques that heavily count on statistical analysis to identify malicious clients, their method leverages a small quantity of acquired data to bootstrap trust.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The work presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> tackles the issue of restricted computational capabilities on client devices and introduces an approach referred to as FedCS. This method aims to address the challenge posed by the diversity of resources available on client devices by introducing certain limitations on the acceptance criteria for updated models. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the authors introduce FedMCCS. This approach considers the resources of each individual device during the selection process. An evaluation of these resources is performed to determine whether a particular device is capable of performing a Federated Learning (FL) task.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Another noteworthy contribution in the field of FL is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed FLOD, an innovative approach designed to defend against byzantine threats in federated learning. FLOD leverages trust establishment, aggregation based on Hamming distance, several optimizations and homomorphic encryption to guarantee resistance to byzantine attacks and privacy preservation. In contrast to other methods, these techniques illustrate the benefits of utilizing trust establishment to assign a trust score to each local model.</p>

</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the literature, the majority of the approaches consider trust from a single-side approach. That is, from the side of the clients or vice versa.
Also, it is important to note that these solutions primarily focus on bootstrapping the overall model and the federated learning process rather than specifically targeting newcomer IoT devices, which is the primary focus of our work. On the other hand, our suggested approach aims to develop a mutual trust-based solution that considers the trust of both entities, i.e., the server as well as the clients. This gives room for less biased selections while minimizing the levels of untrustworthiness in the environment, making the system more robust and secure.</p>

The core concept behind the IQR method involves dividing the dataset into different quartiles, denoted as Q3, Q2, and Q1. Q1 represents the threshold above which 75% of the dataset observations lie, while Q2 corresponds to the median of the sorted dataset. Q3, on the other hand, signifies the point below which 75% of the dataset resides. This approach takes a small dataset as input, containing the average consumption of RAM, CPU, and bandwidth across a group of clients previously involved in federated learning model training with similar resource requirements. To identify potentially suspicious usage patterns within the dataset, the federated server incorporates the Interquartile Range (IQR) statistical technique.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Bootstrapping is a mechanism commonly applied in various areas of study (like cloud computing) to provide recommendations to the different parties involved in roles within the environment. In the context of our work, such a system helps determine the level of trust for newly joined federated servers in the environment when there is no prior information about them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Accordingly, our approach aims to use bootstrapping to assess the trustworthiness of newly added federated servers initially. In our proposed solution, clients create preference lists which contain a list of the federated servers they want to work with based on the trust levels of the servers. Thus, servers without trust scores are excluded from the list, as assigning random trust values can create unfair situations for both the clients and servers. To overcome this problem, our method relies on the collaboration of multiple active clients working together in a distributed manner. Whenever a client encounters a new federated server, it seeks guidance from its neighbouring devices to obtain a recommended trust value.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our collaborative smart devices ecosystem, depicted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-B1 Bootstrapping Overview ‣ III-B Bootstrapping Trust for federated servers ‣ III Problem Formulation ‣ Enhancing Mutual Trustworthiness in Federated Learning for Data-Rich Smart Cities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the smart devices work together to establish a trust score for assessing the trustworthiness of federated servers. Each smart device maintains a comprehensive dataset that captures the historical interactions with the federated server in the previous rounds of training. This dataset encompasses various characteristics, such as type, region, payment, and the corresponding trust score. When a new federated server expresses its willingness to call a specific client (Step I), the client requests from the neighbouring clients to predict the expected trust score for the federated server (Step II). To accomplish this, the client forwards a bootstrapping query to all other active nearby clients (Step II). Subsequently, the intended clients predict the trust score based on their local decision tree classification model (section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS2" title="III-B2 Decision Tree Creation ‣ III-B Bootstrapping Trust for federated servers ‣ III Problem Formulation ‣ Enhancing Mutual Trustworthiness in Federated Learning for Data-Rich Smart Cities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span>2</span></a>) (Step III). Once the trust values are produced, the client aggregates the received scores using the Dempster-Shafer method (DST) by considering the credibility score of each smart device (Step IV). Finally, the smart device updates the credibility score for all participated neighbours based on the DST result (Step V). This collaborative process harnesses the collective knowledge and experiences of the clients in the system to assess the federated servers’ trustworthiness and integration capabilities within the smart cities ecosystem.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The decision tree is a popular supervised technique in machine learning that utilizes the concept of information gain to construct decision trees in a top-down manner. This approach, inspired by the ID3 algorithm and employing a greedy search strategy without backtracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, finds broad application in various domains. Decision trees can be created for regression and classification tasks, where the focus of classification decision trees lies in categorical outcomes. When constructing a classification decision tree, the primary consideration is information gain. Information gain quantifies the decrease in entropy or impurity within a dataset after dividing it based on a specific attribute. The objective is to identify the attribute that maximizes information gain, leading to informative and predictive splits. As the decision tree continues to split the dataset into subsets that are increasingly homogeneous with regards to the target variable, a tree structure gradually emerges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The decision tree begins with a root node and progressively splits the data into branches according to attribute values. At each decision node, the attribute that maximizes information gain is selected for further partitioning. Leaf nodes represent final classification outcomes or class labels. The resulting structure of nodes and branches forms a set of rules that facilitate the classification of new instances.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Information gain is a guiding principle for determining the most informative attribute to split on at each node. It quantifies the level of uncertainty or randomness in the dataset attributable to a specific attribute. The attribute with the highest information gain is deemed the most significant in discriminating between different classes or categories.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After setting up the recommendation trees on each side of the recommender system and obtaining the recommendations, we can move forward to the next phase, which is endorsement aggregation. The main objective of this phase is to combine the collected endorsements in a way that can handle dishonest and misleading submissions. To accomplish this, we apply the Dempster-Shafer method of evidence, which is known for its ability to combine information from different sources. What makes our approach different from existing techniques for trust establishment is that it doesn’t rely on predetermined thresholds for decision-making. Instead, we calculate beliefs about both untrustworthiness and trustworthiness of devices and compare them to make the final decision. Additionally, our approach assigns weights to endorsers based on their credibility scores, which are constantly updated to reflect changes in their honesty over time. This dynamic weight assignment approach differs from the static weight assignment used in other methods.</p>

These datasets were thoughtfully distributed across the smart devices using a non-IID approach. To conduct the experiments, we built upon the ModularFed environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> as our foundation. Each of the smart devices has varying resource capabilities, with RAM capacity ranging from [100, 1300] megabytes, CPU capacity ranging from [50,1000] million instructions per second (MIPS), and network bandwidth varying from [50, 1300] megabits per second (Mbps). For our experimentation, we established two federated servers, each requesting K=20 clients, and intended to conduct a total of 100 federated learning (FL) training rounds, denoted as R. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach. We compared it to the original federated learning technique, which was initially introduced by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In our experiments, we refer to this conventional method as ”VanillaFL.”</p>

Our technique consistently maintains an accuracy of approximately 72%, even when 80% of the devices are untrustworthy, meaning that only 40 smart devices are considered trustworthy. In contrast, the accuracy of VanillaFL experiences a rapid decline as the portion of untrustworthy clients increases, falling to nearly 10% when 80% of the clients are untrustworthy.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we presented innovative matching-based game theory-based strategies for addressing the client-server selection dilemma in federated learning settings, highlighting the necessity of mutual trust and authentication for IoT/IoV devices and federated servers. Our technique improves the overall accuracy of the global federated learning model and reduces the selection of untrustworthy clients, resulting in fewer perceived interactions.
The simulation outcomes prove the effectiveness of our mutual trust matching-based selection technique, resulting in a significant boost in global model accuracy of more than 33% as compared to the conventional VanillaFL on two varied datasets. Furthermore, in an 80% malevolent environment, our strategy decreases the average number of untrustworthy clients chosen from 16 to 2 out of 20.
In the future, we will focus on a full investigation of the network’s sensitivity to device collusion to mitigate or prevent it entirely. Furthermore, we are working to improve a self-healing system that automatically increases the number of trusted clients inside the network while requiring less time and data. These developments can potentially improve the security and efficacy of federated learning systems.</p>
