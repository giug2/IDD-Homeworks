<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The digital economy is a highly relevant item on the European Union’s policy agenda. Cross-border internet purchases are part of the digital economy, but their total value can currently not be accurately measured or estimated. Traditional approaches based on consumer surveys or business surveys are shown to be inadequate for this purpose, due to language bias and sampling issues, respectively. We address both problems by proposing a novel approach based on supply-side data, namely tax returns. The proposed data-driven record-linkage techniques and machine learning algorithms utilize two additional open data sources: European business registers and internet data. Our main finding is that the value of total cross-border internet purchases within the European Union by Dutch consumers was over EUR 1.3 billion in 2016. This is more than 6 times as high as current estimates. Our finding motivates the implementation of the proposed methodology in other EU member states. Ultimately, it could lead to more accurate estimates of cross-border internet purchases within the entire European Union.<span id="footnotex1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the policy of Statistics Netherlands.</span></span></span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Accurate estimates of cross-border online consumption within the European Union (EU) are difficult to obtain. Recently, accurately estimating cross-border online consumption has become more important for two reasons. The first reason is that consumption through online channels of both goods and services is increasing within the EU, especially across borders. Consumers have more access to the internet, shipping costs are decreasing and payment services converge across countries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>]</cite>. Accurate estimates of cross-border online consumption are thus of increasing importance for adequately reporting on national accounts by national statistical institutes. The second reason is that cross-border online trade is nowadays a highly relevant item on the EU’s policy agenda when considering the EU Digital Single Market (European Commission, COM/2010/0245). Therefore, getting grip on cross-border online consumption through reliable estimates is essential in quantifying the effect of any new policy. The need for accurate estimates on aspects of the digital economy within the European Union is emphasized by the <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional methods for estimating consumption are based on either consumer surveys or business surveys. One EU-wide consumer survey on cross-border online consumption is conducted by Ecommerce Europe (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecommerce-europe.eu" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://www.ecommerce-europe.eu</a>). In the Netherlands, this survey is conducted by market research institute GfK (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gfk.com" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://www.gfk.com</a>). It is commissioned by the national e-commerce association in the Netherlands, Thuiswinkel.org (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thuiswinkel.org" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://www.thuiswinkel.org</a>), on behalf of Ecommerce Europe. The estimates of total cross-border online consumption are based on asking consumers how much they spent at foreign webshops over a fixed time period in the past. However, webshops selling goods or services typically operate in a country using a website in the regional language <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite>. This observation corresponds to the main impediment of online consumption, which is foreign language, rather than security reasons, shipping costs, geographical distance or available payment services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is difficult for a consumer to distinguish between domestic and foreign webshops, as both will be presented in the same, regional language. A consumer-survey approach thus leads to a severe downward bias in measuring cross-border online consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A solution suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite> is to use business surveys instead. For measuring cross-border online consumption of consumers in a single country, large companies within the EU should report their sales to consumers per EU member state. This places a huge burden on companies. Moreover, the approach poses significant challenges on any correction for sampling probabilities and biases if, for example, the population of the existing ICT business survey would be used. The referenced population is the result of sampling and stratification with respect to (a) economic activity and (b) either relative turnover or number of employees. The stratified sampling probabilities with respect to size in one country have to be transformed into that of the total online sales in another country. Given large differences between countries in this regard, it seems infeasible to arrive at accurate estimations for cross-border online consumption for each EU member state using the suggested solution. It thus renders traditional official statistical methods inadequate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the shortcomings of traditional methods, an adequate method to measure cross-border online consumption should at least meet the following three requirements. First, the method should be based on supply-side data, to prevent a strong downward bias due to a webshop’s availability in different languages. Second, it should be based on existing data that were collected to accurately measure the sales of companies across borders. A reliable administrative or other integral data source would be preferable, to prevent dealing with sampling issues. Third, the data would have to be available to national statistical institutes across the European Union in order to longitudinally monitor cross-border online consumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by these three requirements, we propose to use supply-side data in the form of tax returns filed by foreign companies. The EU system of value added tax (VAT) states that any company established in the EU that is involved with cross-border intra-community supplies to consumers has to pay VAT in the country of destination, through filing a tax return (European Commission, Council Directive 2006/112/EC). The threshold value on total turnover from sales to consumers, above which filing a tax return is mandatory, is either EUR 35,000 or EUR 100,000, depending on the country of destination. For foreign companies selling to consumers in the Netherlands, the threshold value on total sales in the Netherlands equals EUR 100,000. The Dutch Tax and Customs Administration collects such tax returns, which are then made available to Statistics Netherlands. Here we note that using these data restricts us to measuring cross-border <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">online consumption of goods</em> (henceforth referred to as cross-border internet purchases). The approach that we will propose cannot be applied to measure cross-border <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">online consumption of services</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.2" class="ltx_p">The main challenge in using filed tax returns is to identify webshops. For this identification, we propose a two-phase approach. In the first phase, the aim is to select the companies that are economically active in retail trade, according to the NACE (Rev. 2) classification of industries. NACE is the acronym for <em id="S1.p6.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Nomenclature statistique des Activités économiques dans la Communauté Européenne</em> and is thus the "statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community". The filed tax returns do contain a classification of economic activity for each company. However, it is based on a statistical classification of industries as of 1974. As webshops did not exist in 1974, the classification is inadequate in identifying webshops. We propose a data fusion approach, merging the companies filing tax returns with a complete list of European companies active in retail trade. The list can be obtained from any business register (BR) containing the company names, country of establishment and the NACE classification of industries for every company in the EU. We choose to use the global ORBIS database (<a target="_blank" href="http://bvdinfo.com/orbis" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">http://bvdinfo.com/orbis</a>), maintained by Bureau van Dijk, as it is an open data source. We remark that the legal name of a company can be registered differently in the BR compared to the filed tax returns. As a result, merging legal company names from the two datasets is not straightforward due to challenges related to record linkage. Mostly, only three types of differences occur. The first type of difference results from different uses of non-alphanumeric characters, such as a period (<span id="S1.p6.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath">.</span>), a hyphen (<math id="S1.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="-" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml">−</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1b"><minus id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1"></minus></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1c">-</annotation></semantics></math>) or an ampersand (&amp;). The second type of difference is the notation (abbreviated or fully written out) of the type of business entity, at the end of a legal company name. An example is <em id="S1.p6.2.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ltd</em> instead of <em id="S1.p6.2.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">limited</em>. The third type of difference is spelling, in particular for non-ASCII characters such as the German <em id="S1.p6.2.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ü</em>, which occurs either as <em id="S1.p6.2.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ue</em> or simply <em id="S1.p6.2.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">u</em>. Other common differences in spelling are the use or omission of white spaces, such as writing <em id="S1.p6.2.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">web shop</em> instead of <em id="S1.p6.2.9" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">webshop</em>. Other types of occurring differences, such as an updated company name which has been processed in only one of the two databases, are more complicated. We use text mining and data-driven record-linkage techniques to neutralize the first three types of differences. A significant part of the methods section describes this first phase.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">A second phase is necessary, because being a foreign company active in retail trade, exporting to the Netherlands is not equivalent to being a foreign webshop, exporting to the Netherlands. We might assume that a foreign webshop that sells goods to consumers in the Netherlands will file a tax return (if the annual turnover is above the threshold value) and will be registered as a retail company in the BR, either as principal or secondary economic activity. However, a foreign company that files a tax return in the Netherlands and that is registered as a retail company in the BR, might not necessarily be active as an online retailer <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">in the Netherlands</em>. As a result, merging tax returns and the list of retail companies in the BR might lead to false positives. Therefore, we propose a second phase based on internet data. This phase roughly consists of two steps. The first step is to find the web page of a company based on the legal company name. The second step is to assess whether the web page belongs to a webshop, using text-based features obtained from the HTML-code of the web page.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In the implementation of the two phases described above, fine tuning of parameters is still required. We provide for phase an example. In the first phase, for example, it has to be specified how similar two legal company names should be in order to be considered identical. It requires choosing an optimal threshold value for the similarity score of two legal company names. In the second phase, for example, a function has to be chosen that maps text-based features obtained from the data to a binary categorization, namely webshop or not a webshop. In both phases, the fine tuning of parameters is achieved by using machine learning techniques. The challenge in using machine learning is choosing a suitable algorithm from the wide variety of machine learning algorithms that exist. A solution is to compare the goodness of fit of a variety of machine learning algorithms. The algorithm that performs best according to the goodness of fit on the data is chosen to fine tune the parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed approach is a combination of using supply-side data measuring internet sales and data-driven methods to identify foreign webshops. We claim that the proposed approach yields more accurate estimates of cross-border internet purchases than existing or earlier suggested approaches. It should be noted that the proposed approach might still result in an estimate of cross-border internet purchases with a small downward bias, for which two reasons can be identified. First, companies with sales below the threshold value in the country of destination do not have to file a tax return. The internet purchases at such small companies are therefore missing in a measurement based on filed tax returns. We remark that there may exist many companies of this type. Second, the reported turnover from sales to consumers might be inaccurate, potentially leading to an underestimation of the total cross-border internet purchases. The second effect, however, is expected to be minimal, due to strict law enforcement by and collaboration between tax authorities in the EU. Whatever the cause, we do not aim to correct for any of these two biases, as there is no data available to estimate them. Moreover, our main aim is to demonstrate the severe downward bias of consumer-survey approaches compared to a supply-side approach in estimating cross-border internet purchases within the EU. We therefore do not mind if our supply-side approach still yields a conservative estimate.</p>

Logically, this dataset of tax returns filed in the Netherlands is not openly available, due to strict privacy legislation. Under severe restrictions (among others, anonymizing) and obeying serious impositions (such as suppressing extreme values), we are permitted to present aggregated figures on the data. When relevant, we reveal the criterion for which we suppressed information.

It contains detailed corporate information on over 200 million private companies worldwide.

Data on smaller foreign companies are not needed in our analysis, as they do not have to file tax returns in the Netherlands. The ORBIS database is used, because it contains the principal and secondary NACE (Rev. 2) codes for companies established in the EU.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to train classification algorithms, a labeled dataset is required. Since no such dataset existed, it was manually constructed as follows. The filed tax returns contain a classification of economic activity according to the (outdated) statistical classification of industries as of 1974. At first glance, most webshops seemed to be classified as <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Retail Trade</em>, many as <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Wholesale trade</em> and some as another type of industry according to the outdated classification. We constructed a training dataset of 180 companies by manually categorizing all companies of which the total annual turnover in at least one year exceeded an industry-dependent threshold value (see Table <a href="#S2.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 2.2 Training and Validation Dataset ‣ 2 Data ‣ A Data-Driven Supply-Side Approach for Measuring Cross-Border Internet Purchases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, column 2).

The first categorization is whether the company is economically active as a retail company according to the BR.

Our three-step approach is based on the first published stemming algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">1968</a>]</cite> as well as on Porter’s stemming algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">1980</a>]</cite>. The latter still is “the most common algorithm for stemming English” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>, p. 32]</cite>. In the first step, a country-dependent list of most common end-of-string words, or suffixes, of variable length in the BR is constructed. Only the BR is used, as the dataset of filed tax returns does not contain a company’s country of establishment. As the names of types of business entities strongly differ per country, the types of business entities in smaller countries might not show up as most common suffixes. It is assumed that a suffix, if present, consists of at least one and at most four words. The most common suffixes are complemented with a list of known types of business entities per EU member state, obtained from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_business_entities" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_business_entities</a>.
In the second step, the obtained list of suffixes is reduced to a list of most common starts of suffixes. It not only reduces the computation time of removing a suffix, but it also increases the number of suffixes found. This step is inspired by Porter’s algorithm for stemming English <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">1980</a>]</cite>. In the third and final step, suffixes are removed from company names in both lists by searching for any of the most common starts of suffixes. It is ensured that the remaining <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px1.p2.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stems</em> of company names are never empty.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The second problem is that the stems might be spelled differently in both datasets. A typical example would be <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">webshop ltd</em> versus <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">web shop ltd</em> or <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">web-shop ltd</em>. Another typical difference occurs in, for example, German names, such as <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">muller</em> versus <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">mueller</em>.

We consider the linear classification algorithms Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Linear Support Vector Classification (LinSVC). The nonlinear algorithms implemented are k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Support Vector Classification with Radial Basis Function Kernel (RBFSVC). Further more, we examine three ensemble algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB) and AdaBoost (AB). The algorithms will mostly be referred to using the acronyms between brackets.
The details on the specifications of the classification algorithms can be found in, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>]</cite> or <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Now, for each algorithm and each parameter setting in the parameter grid, stratified 5-fold cross-validation is performed on the training dataset. Cross-validation is used to prevent overfitting. The choice of using 5 folds is based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">1992</a>]</cite>, although it might introduce more variance than choosing 10 or 20 folds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>]</cite>. However, due to the small size of the training dataset, choosing 10 or 20 folds might lead to unstable results. Therefore, we have chosen to use <em id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stratified</em> 5-fold cross-validation in order to reduce the variance, as suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, we optimize parameter settings using mean F1 scores over the 5 folds. We prefer F1 over accuracy due to the low base rate of webshops occurring in the entire dataset. We do not use the common metric AUROC to optimize parameter settings, as it is known to possibly mask poor performance when facing imbalanced data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>]</cite>. As our data is in fact strongly imbalanced, due to the low base rate of webshops, it does not seem wise to use AUROC as optimizing metric. Moreover, optimizing AUROC does not, in general, imply optimizing F1 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>]</cite>. Thus, for each algorithm the parameter setting that maximizes the mean F1 score over the five folds is selected. Subsequently, the mean and standard deviation of F1 scores over the five folds between the ten optimal classification algorithms are compared.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.Px4.p6.10" class="ltx_p">Finally, both the mean F1 score and the standard deviation of F1 scores over the five folds are considered in choosing the final classification algorithm and corresponding parameter settings. If necessary, the local behaviour on the parameter grid is examined to reduce the standard deviation of F1 scores over the five folds. This final classification algorithm is then trained on the entire training dataset.

A URL might be available in filed tax returns in some countries. In tax returns filed in the Netherlands, it is not. Therefore, at Statistics Netherlands, software has been developed to find the URL of the home page of a company based on the legal company name. The software, referred to as <em id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">URLfinding</em>, uses Google’s Search API. The input is a list of legal company names and the output is a list of URLs per company, ranked according to a score between 0 (definitely not a match) and 1 (definitely a match). The score is referred to as the matching probability, however note that it should not be interpreted as an actual probability in the statistical sense (see (<math id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="*" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∗</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.m1.1b"><times id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.Px1.p1.1.m1.1c">*</annotation></semantics></math>) below).

The training set consists of a few thousand Dutch companies from different industries of different sizes, in terms of number of employees.

The choice of these three languages is based on the fact that most Dutch citizens mostly speak only Dutch, English and/or German.

We have chosen not to follow this approach, as it would lead to serious dimensionality issues: the number of different words (features) would be much larger than the number of documents (companies in the training set).</p>

This assumption might be argued to be incorrect for two reasons. First, it is more difficult to find the correct web site for a small company than for a large company. Moreover, a small company that is not a webshop might not even have a web site. Second, the coverage and quality of the BR for smaller companies is significantly lower than for larger companies. Both reasons imply that the probability of a classification error (more specifically, a false negative classification error) increases as turnover decreases. However, estimating <math id="S3.SS2.p3.5.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p3.5.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p3.5.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p3.5.m3.1.1.cmml">P</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p3.5.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p3.5.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p3.5.m3.1.1">𝑃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p3.5.m3.1c">P</annotation></semantics></math> for different turnover classes, as suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite>, requires a far larger training dataset, which is quite labour intensive. Moreover, it would also require some large companies <em id="S3.SS2.p3.6.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">not</em> to be included in the training dataset. We do not believe that this is wise in our case, as the turnover distribution is highly skewed, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1 Data Description ‣ 2 Data ‣ A Data-Driven Supply-Side Approach for Measuring Cross-Border Internet Purchases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> in Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="2.1 Data Description ‣ 2 Data ‣ A Data-Driven Supply-Side Approach for Measuring Cross-Border Internet Purchases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1</span></a>.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed data-driven supply-side approach for measuring cross-border internet purchases within the EU can be summarized as follows. Based on EU VAT legislation, the starting point is a dataset of tax returns filed by foreign companies established within the EU. Tax returns are <em id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">supply-side</em> data as they contains company sales. Then, the challenge was to identify webshops within the dataset of tax returns. We solved this problem in two phases. In the first phase, we implemented approximate string matching techniques to merge the set of tax returns to a business register of retail companies established within the EU. The merging can be viewed as <em id="S3.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data-driven</em> record-linkage, as we optimized the performance of the approximate string matching using machine learning algorithms. In the second phase, we used web scraping in combination with (<em id="S3.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data-driven</em>) machine learning to assess whether a company is a webshop. The outcomes of the two phases are combined to obtain a more accurate estimate of cross-border internet purchases. Moreover, we use the data to estimate the bias and standard deviation of the estimate. Thus, the proposed methods applied on the proposed data yield our data-driven supply-side approach for measuring cross-border internet purchases within the EU.</p>

Again, the algorithms are ranked with respect to the optimal mean F1 score over the folds in the stratified 5-fold cross-validation. The standard deviation in scores over the five folds is shown in parentheses. Observe that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) perform considerably less well than the other algorithms. Moreover, observe that the linear algorithms (LR, LinSVC, LDA) perform less well than the remaining algorithms. It suggests that a linear separation of the data points in higher dimensional space does not yield the best classification on unseen data. Note that the ensemble methods (AB, GB, RF) outperform the other methods.

The reason for this choice is that RF maximizes mean precision. Moreover, the local behaviour of the F1 score of RF, as a function of the algorithm parameters, is more stable around the optimal parameters compared to the local behaviour for AB and GB.

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the Netherlands, total household consumption on retail goods (food and durable goods, codes 1000 up until and including 3000) in 2016 is equal to EUR 87,206 million, according to Statistics Netherlands (<a target="_blank" href="https://opendata.cbs.nl" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://opendata.cbs.nl</a>). Statistics Netherlands does not publish the total online consumption of goods by Dutch consumers. The only currently available estimate is by Thuiswinkel.org and GfK and it is based on consumer surveys. The estimate for 2016 equals EUR 11.01 billion. It seems possible that just over 12 per cent of online consumption by Dutch consumers is spent at foreign webshops established within the EU. Besides, Statistics Netherlands does publish year-on-year growth figures on online retail sales by Dutch webshops. In 2016, this year-on-year growth was equal to 22.1 per cent. It is quite similar to the growth of 21.2 per cent that we find by comparing the values of <math id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="y" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">y</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑦</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">y</annotation></semantics></math> in 2015 and 2016 as presented in Table <a href="#S4.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 4.3 Estimating Cross-Border Internet Purchases ‣ 4 Results ‣ A Data-Driven Supply-Side Approach for Measuring Cross-Border Internet Purchases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Reflecting on our main findings, we note that the standard deviation of the final estimate would still be too large for official statistical purposes.

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ A Data-Driven Supply-Side Approach for Measuring Cross-Border Internet Purchases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we have claimed that a our data-driven supply-side approach would be more accurate than demand-side approaches to estimate cross-border internet purchases within the EU. To support this claim, we compare our results for the Netherlands to the results of the consumer-survey approach by market research institute GfK (commissioned by Thuiswinkel.org on behalf of Ecommerce Europe). In 2016, total cross-border online consumption by Dutch consumers according to GfK was equal to EUR 637 million, EUR 190 million of which was spent in China and EUR 70 million in the United States. This implies that at most EUR 377 million was spent within the EU. Note that this figure includes online consumption of both goods and services.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moveover, the fraction of online consumption of goods in the total online consumption in 2016, as reported by GfK, was EUR 11.01 billion / EUR 20.16 billion = 0.55. We assume that this proportion is independent of the location of the purchased goods or services. As a result, cross-border online purchases of goods within the EU, according to GfK, would approximately equal EUR 206 million in 2016.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We, however, find EUR 1,372 million for 2016 with a standard deviation of EUR 110 million. The estimate is more that 6 times as high as that of GfK. Our results thus show the severe downward bias in using demand-side approaches to estimate cross-border online consumption and it motivates the implementation of our approach in other EU member states.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Main Conclusion and Future Work</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have proposed to use tax returns, business registers and internet data to measure cross-border internet purchases within the EU. We have implemented data-driven methods to combine these supply-side data in a computationally efficient manner. The empirical results show that the proposed approach leads to a strong improvement of existing approaches based on consumer surveys, as it overcomes the language bias as described in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ A Data-Driven Supply-Side Approach for Measuring Cross-Border Internet Purchases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In particular, we find that cross-border internet purchases by Dutch consumers within the EU in 2016 equal EUR 1,372 million. Market research institute GfK (commissioned by Thuiswinkel.org on behalf of Ecommerce Europe) estimate it to be approximately EUR 206 million based on consumer surveys. The language bias in consumer surveys thus results in a downward bias of a factor of more than 6 in cross-border internet purchases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed approach only requires foreign companies’ tax returns to contain the legal company name and the turnover taxed at high or low tariff. Due to EU VAT legislation these data are available in every EU member state. Note that we do not require that the economic activity of a company is accurately available in filed tax returns. The training and test set could even be constructed without any known economic activity, by viewing all companies as belonging to the same class and following the construction as described in Sections <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Training and Validation Dataset ‣ 2 Data ‣ A Data-Driven Supply-Side Approach for Measuring Cross-Border Internet Purchases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a> and <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3 Test Dataset ‣ 2 Data ‣ A Data-Driven Supply-Side Approach for Measuring Cross-Border Internet Purchases" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>. Moreover, we do not assume that the URL of the home page of a company is available in filed tax returns. Furthermore, the additional data (the BR and internet data) required by the proposed approach are obtained from open data sources. Hence, here we arrive at our main conclusion, viz. that the proposed approach is expected to be applicable in any other EU member state and thus can estimate cross-border internet purchases within the EU.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Further applications of the proposed supply-side approach include revealing the structure of the cross-border online retail market in any EU member state. Our approach directly returns a list of foreign webshops and their annual cross-border internet sales to the observing country. If the information on domestic webshops active on the country’s online market is complemented, it can be used to analyse the market structure. A related research topic is the export of all webshops established in a single EU member state. It is related as it is the supply-side counterpart of the cross-border online consumption market within a country. It might be interesting to compare the two market structures within individual countries and compare the market structures between countries within the EU.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Future work on measuring cross-border internet purchases within the EU might focus on improving the website-based predictions of company classifications. The empirical results show that it is the weakest part of the proposed approach, as the F1 scores for website-based predictions are lower than the F1-scores for the BR-based predictions. The main improvement could be achieved by sophisticating the URLfinding algorithm in order to increase the recall of the predictions. We suggest to enlarge the training set of the URLfinding algorithm from Dutch to European websites using the company names and URLs registered in the BR. We consider this improvement outside the scope of the current paper, as the results of our supply-side approach already show a strong improvement compared to existing consumer-survey approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To summarize, we have proposed a data-driven supply-side approach for measuring cross-border internet purchases within the EU. Our main findings motivate the implementation of our approach in other EU member states. As our approach is based on EU VAT legislation, international comparability will be guaranteed. Ultimately, it will lead to more accurate estimates of cross-border internet purchases within the entire EU.</p>
