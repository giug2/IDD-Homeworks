<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Integration of machine learning (ML) in 5G-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks has enabled intelligent transportation and smart traffic management. Nonetheless, the security against adversarial poisoning attacks is also increasingly becoming a challenging task. Specifically, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is one of the widely used ML designs in IoV applications. The standard ML security techniques are not effective in DRL where the algorithm learns to solve sequential decision-making through continuous interaction with the environment, and the environment is time-varying, dynamic, and mobile. In this paper, we propose a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based federated continual learning (GFCL) anomaly detection framework against Sybil-based data poisoning attacks in IoV. The objective is to present a lightweight and scalable framework that learns and detects the illegitimate behavior without having a-priori training dataset consisting of attack samples. We use GRU to predict a future data sequence to analyze and detect illegitimate behavior from vehicles in a federated learning-based distributed manner. We investigate the performance of our framework using real-world vehicle mobility traces. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in terms of different performance metrics.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the adoption of modern networking and 5G technologies, the internet of vehicles (IoV) brings in enormous benefits to the automative industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The concept of cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) was first standardized in the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) release 14. Today, in the era of 5G, we witness promising developments in IoV. It contributes to broader connectivity, fast responses, wider interoperability, high reliability, and smart traffic management. To achieve high performance, IoV requires intelligent decision-making capabilities. Thus, integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising approach for IoV applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Innovations and intelligence always bring advantages and limitations. The adversarial attacks on ML are one such limitation that is becoming an active area of research as ML grows to play an important role in vehicle automation. While ML provides transportation intelligence and improved safety in IoV, the security of the ML model itself is not guaranteed. Based on a recent survey, Microsoft shares that 90% of businesses don’t have enough security for their ML-operated systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Similarly, the adversarial attacks, such as data poisoning attacks, on ML in the context of vehicular industry are not much explored in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Such attacks in vehicular applications can be a danger to human lives leading to dire consequences unless the possible vulnerabilities are not addressed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Driven by the time-varying and mobile nature of vehicles, DRL has become a promising ML technique for autonomous driving, task offloading, task scheduling, service placement, security and many other applications of vehicular networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we focus on data poisoning attacks on DRL. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows a framework of the IoV network where vehicles communicate with the edge network to avail services from DRL-based intelligent control methods. The DRL framework consists of an agent and environment, where the environment generates a state (input data) and reward (feedback), and an agent takes an action based on its policy. Here, an agent is a deep learning model which repeatedly interacts with an environment (in the form of state and reward collection) and learns a policy. The continual interaction of the DRL framework with the environment (i.e. vehicles), exposes it to many security vulnerabilities. The security problems of DRL are different from other ML types because DRL learns to solve sequential decision-making through continuous feedback from the environment whereas traditional ML deals with the prediction problems.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several adversarial data poisoning attacks are common for vehicular applications and the impact of such attacks can increase with Sybils leading to denial of service due to overloading of the network with poisonous messages. The adversary type we study here performs data poisoning over the environment to interfere with the network’s healthy functioning. The attack over an edge-based DRL framework is a serious threat where decisions are based on feedback/rewards collected by the DRL agent. In this paper, we develop an anomaly detection framework against Sybil-based data poisoning attacks in IoV. The objective of our work is to implement a life-long and lightweight anomaly detection framework for IoV applications where the environment is time-varying and dynamic. The goal is to propose a framework that learns and detects the illegitimate behavior without having a-priori training dataset consisting of attack samples. Several ML-based attack detection frameworks make specific assumptions about an adversary, prepare a supervised dataset and use a traditional classification model to train a network and detect the known pattern. Different from them, we propose a model which learns and detects an attack from the time-varying IoV environment as it progresses.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The continuous interaction of DRL with the environment makes it more vulnerable than other ML techniques. Data poisoning attacks like label flipping, backdoor attack, and model poisoning attack are very common adversarial attacks on DRL and are explored in the literature for IoV applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In a recent work, the authors provide a comprehensive survey on various adversarial data poisoning attacks on DRL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The authors in this work briefly discuss the possible choices of attacks carried out by an adversary on a DRL model which includes an attack on the state, action, reward, and model. Among the various works in the literature, the works that focus on attacks over reward function is recent. To the best of our knowledge, no works consider the vehicular applications where the environment is dynamic and time-varying. In this context, we study the problem of Sybil-based data poisoning attacks over the reward function of the DRL framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The Sybil attack is well-studied in the literature. However, the existing solutions are not effective on time-varying vehicular networks. This is due to the lack of the availability of the historical behavior in anomaly detection schemes and difficulty in tracing high mobility vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Some researchers propose to use privacy-preserving schemes against Sybil attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, adversaries are using well-trained intelligent ML techniques to craft an attack and impose more serious threats against privacy mechanisms in mobile networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Despite being a critical threat, the study on anomaly detection mechanisms against Sybil-based data poisoning attacks in IoV applications have not been explored much in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, Chen et. al presents state-of-the-art on data poisoning attacks in IoV applications. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Huang et. al studied the vulnerability of RL and shows that even in black-box scenarios it is easy to confuse RL policies. Another easy-to-deploy poisoning attack over a deep learning-enabled IoV application is performed by leveraging particle swarm optimization in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, DRL can be used to provide defense and improve the recovery ability of the IoV network from data poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, the defense against poisoning of DRL itself is less explored and requires investigation in the area of vehicular applications where traffic is mobile and time-varying.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The existing defense mechanisms against such attacks are classified into data-based defense and model-based defense <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The data-based defense mechanisms perform adversarial training where they input adversarial examples in a supervised manner into the data while performing training. First, such defenses are effective when dealing with image datasets. Second, this method is not applicable for applications where we do not use existing big data and instead train our network from the environment as it progresses. In addition, several authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> show that no matter how many adversarial examples we add, there are always new and improved techniques that can poison the network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In a model-based defense, the modification of the network structure is performed to improve robustness against poisoning attacks. In this method, sub-network or multimodel architectures are used to detect anomalies. In our work, we study the problem of attacks over the environment, the use of network structure modification is useful and effective by using an additional sub-network to detect anomalies and poisoned values before feeding data into the DRL framework. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> use a deep neural network-based sub-network along with DRL to train and perform a binary classification for detecting real and adversarial data inputs. It achieves a detection accuracy of 70% and works for image inputs. Siwakorn in recent work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposes to use multiple models to enhance the robustness against adversarial attacks. This work uses a family of five models to enhance detection accuracy. It considers image datasets and works well for white-box poisoning attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, researchers propose to use generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate adversarial samples and train a neural network in a supervised manner to use an additional ML classifier before RL for detecting anomalous inputs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Such methods are only effective when datasets are available beforehand. We note that GANs can be used not only for defense but also for performing adversarial attacks over RL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Cui et. al in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> propose a decentralized scheme that uses blockchain-based verification and federated learning along with DRL-based resource scheduling scheme to protect the DRL from being poisoned. This scheme is proposed for latency-sensitive applications with a fixed number of users without considering the mobility of users and its time-varying properties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In our work, we use a multiple-model design where a GRU-based federated continual learning (GFCL) is deployed before the DRL framework to help detect poisoned feedback values before inputting them into the model. Here, the choice of federated learning and continual learning along with GRU is significant because of distributed, mobile and time-varying properties of the vehicular environment.</p>

It is an objective-oriented learning framework.

It consists of an agent and environment, where the environment generates a state and reward, and the agent takes an action based on its policy. In DRL, the agent is a deep learning model which collects data (state) from an environment and learns a policy. Here, the policy is to maximize the network performance as it progresses in the form of positive future rewards. The agent uses a policy to take an action and in return, the environment gives feedback by rewarding the desired actions and punishing the undesired ones.</p>

Sybil attack is easy to launch in vehicular networks where the communication is wireless, broadcast, and dynamic. The adversary type we study here is a set of Sybil nodes that has access to the environment and performs data poisoning over the DRL reward values.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We assume a compromised vehicle/node that launches Sybil attacks and purposely stoles the identities of legitimate vehicles. Several network monitoring tools exist that attackers can use to obtain and analyze the data. The stolen identities can easily be hidden by temporarily restricting the imitated vehicles from the network. We also assume that the adversary has access to all the information of the compromised vehicles which helps an attacker to pass the security checks of the network. Further, an adversary is able to reprogram the vehicle to perform data poisoning by sending forged information to the network. The forged information is the malicious reward values that can alter the optimal decision-making capability of the DRL framework.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our study, the reward values are delay values. Delay is one of the key performance metrics and is used by several research works as an objective parameter to optimize network performance. The goal of an adversary in this attack model is to manipulate the delay values and affect the model behavior where such values are aggregated to optimize network performance. The manipulation of delay values is interesting and noteworthy where we consider an attacker to be intelligent in poisoning data so that traditional rule-based methods or threshold-based methods cannot detect the attack. The rationale is the fake values are smaller delay values from the valid range of possible observed delay values in the given scenario. The choice of smaller values is random but from a valid range depending on the prior monitoring of traffic by an attacker because the goal is to choose poisonous delay values such that it is perceptually indistinguishable from true inputs values. The idea of replacing true delay values with smaller delay values will obscure the DRL framework, and it interprets that the network performance is good and vehicles can continue getting service from the same network settings. Thus the vehicles are receiving poor service and the delay is increasing which is undesirable.</p>

We also examined the impact of the proportion of Sybil-attacked vehicles in the network and demonstrated that the performance is significantly affected by Sybil-based poisoning attacks when compared to adversary-free healthy network scenarios. Different from our previous work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, this work focuses on detecting such attacks and minimizing their impact on the network decision-making capabilities.</p>

Only those vehicles which are found legitimate will take part in the reward collection of the DRL-based IoV application. We do not consider using the cloud for deploying the global node here to avoid the additional delays which may add up because of frequent data transmission between long-distanced cloud and edge layers.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data acquisition is an important phase of an ML algorithm design. The vehicles in an IoV network generate massive data which captures the network states and characteristics that could be used by different DRL-based designs as input rewards to optimize the model performance. Delay is one of the potential performance indicators in IoV applications where Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC)-based applications are gaining popularity. We choose to use delay as our input feature value. The selection of a single feature type is important in our application. The time duration of a vehicle connecting to the edge node is limited and keeps changing due to the vehicle’s mobility. We use a single feature where multiple vehicles traveling along the same route and near to each other will generate the same range of delay values which are accumulated to generate enough data for efficient training of the deep model. Also, with the use of continual learning due to the time-varying nature of the IoV environment, the ML algorithm will be trained repeatedly to accommodate future changes. The use of multiple features will result in a massive amount of input and require a large amount of time to process data and generate results. Additionally, the choice of feature type is also important as irrelevant features may introduce noise and affect network performance. Therefore, our design limits the data acquisition phase to the collection of only delay values observed by vehicles while receiving a desired service type from the network. This also helps to reduce training complexity and achieve faster GRU-based predictions.</p>

ML algorithms are known to perform better with a normalized set of input features. Note that because of normalization the proposed model is applicable even if the key feature is other than delay. Additionally, to prevent training data from diverging, it is important to remove large variations without changing the statistical properties of data. Therefore, we use Z-score data standardization to achieve scaling and prevent divergence. Using Z-score standardization, the data will be normalized to have standard distribution properties of zero mean and unit variance.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a novel distributed machine learning framework that can be used for secure data sharing problems in IoV applications. FL integrated design offers scalability as the training process is distributed among multiple edge nodes and executed in parallel. In this work, we leverage a federated learning approach along with a GRU-based prediction framework for data sharing from vehicles where data is massively distributed. The key idea is to increase data participation from more edge nodes and maximize the knowledge for efficient attack detection design.</p>

Each local node is able to perform delay prediction based on the data collected locally. We leverage federated learning at the global node to implement distributed learning from multiple local nodes. It is a privacy-preserving approach where local nodes share model updates with centralized global nodes, rather than collecting data. The IoV network is large with a huge number of edge nodes and contribution from each edge node is imbalanced. To limit the imbalance, we apply clustering to group edge nodes into a set of <math id="S5.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">E</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝐸</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p3.1.m1.1c">E</annotation></semantics></math> number of edge nodes.

The idea is to have a single aggregator at the edge level to increase the stronger participation of more vehicles from a distributed IoV network. The aggregation at a global node uses the classical federated averaging function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The federated training and anomaly detection process are briefly discussed in this section. The training is based on a window-based learning method, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-A Training Process and Detection ‣ V Integration of Federated Approach ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Each window corresponds to a batch of input values received in multiple time slots. The continual learning works in multiple rounds. In each round, the window slides by one slot. For a given batch size, a set of predictions will be calculated which will help to detect anomalies. In this paper, we use batch size as 200 which predicts a set of 20 (i.e. 10% of 200) next values with good accuracy. In each round, we roll the window to the right by one slot, update the batch of data by including new set of input values received during the slot, and make a new set of predictions. We illustrate the window-based approach for three rounds in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-A Training Process and Detection ‣ V Integration of Federated Approach ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. This process runs in a life-long learning (or continual learning) manner intending to extend the acquired stream of knowledge and use it for future misbehavior detection.</p>

In this work, we use a delay threshold of 10. The choice of threshold value is important and must work well for attack and no-attack scenarios. If we choose a large threshold, it will be harder for the model to detect the attacks. On the other hand, if we choose a small threshold, multiple false alarms can be triggered. Hence, based on the maximum value of training MSE we get (i.e. <math id="S5.SS1.p2.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="7" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p2.5.m5.1a"><mn id="S5.SS1.p2.5.m5.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml">7</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p2.5.m5.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.5.m5.1.1">7</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p2.5.m5.1c">7</annotation></semantics></math> as shown later in results section), we found the threshold of 10 as most appropriate.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, we use MATLAB software to perform GFCL-based anomaly detection. The GRU architecture of local and global nodes contains an input layer, 3 GRU layers with 64-128-256 hidden unit, a fully connected layer, and a regression layer. The number of hidden components is chosen after performing multiple trial-and-error-based experimentations. We observe in our trials that smaller-to-bigger hidden unit size performs better compared to the bigger-to-smaller hidden unit size in GRU layers. The model is trained on Intel Corei5 2GHz and 8GB RAM CPU using ADAM optimizer. The batch size of 200 is used during every training iteration. The choice of batch size is based on experimental results which are discussed in Section <a href="#S6.SS3.SSS2" title="VI-C2 Impact of Batch Size ‣ VI-C Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-C</span>2</span></a>. The learning rate of 0.01 is used along with a learning rate drop factor of 0.2 after every 125 epochs. The maximum number of the epoch is set to 200. We use a gradient threshold of 1 to prevent the gradients from exploding. The training of the network is continual but in these results, we train our model 10 times (i.e. 10 rounds) with a batch size of 200 during each round of learning.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we briefly discuss the performance of our proposed GFCL framework using different evaluation metrics. In the first place, Fig. <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI-C1 Performance of Proposed Framework ‣ VI-C Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI-C1 Performance of Proposed Framework ‣ VI-C Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> illustrate average training loss for different neural network models and the training loss against the number of rounds, respectively. Here, LM and GM denote the local model and the global model, respectively. Fig. <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI-C1 Performance of Proposed Framework ‣ VI-C Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> depicts the average training loss for LMs and GM. The average performance of GM is best compared to all other models. In most of the ML types, the amount of data used to learn has a significant impact on model performance. LMs have limited data in their scope, therefore the training results by local models alone are poorer when compared to the global model. Due to small data, the underfitting problem occurs. On the contrary, in GM, the aggregation of data at a global server maximizes the knowledge and the model performs significantly better than the performance of LM alone. This justifies the use of federated learning along with GRU in our work to enhance the effectiveness of the model by data sharing in V2V.</p>

At the first round of training, the volume of data is small and the model performance is less compared to other rounds of training. This is due to the fact that with little information at first, it is hard for a model to understand the vehicle’s pattern and IoV environment. It can also be observed at the first round of training that the performance of GM is poor compared to most of LMs due to the sudden reception of a variety of vehicle patterns from different LMs. However, as the number of rounds increases and the vehicle participation increase, then the loss performance gets significantly better as compared to the first round. In addition, after the first round, the performance of GM is always better than all local models because it has more knowledge compared to all other models.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To analyze the performance of our design in predicting future time slots of a data sequence, we plot mean delay difference (MDD) in Fig. <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ VI-C1 Performance of Proposed Framework ‣ VI-C Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. It is the absolute delay difference between actually received delay values and predicted delay values. Notably, the average difference in real and predicted delay is quite low for a given set of predictions, not just a single value of prediction. It is worth noting that the MDD by each node is tightly grouped and it doesn’t have many outliers because we chose to perform continual learning to leverage the time-varying property of IoV. It also indicates the good choice of hyper-parameters in our design.</p>

We measure the given metrics against different ratios of vehicles under attack. The results show that the proposed GFCL framework achieves good performance in terms of accuracy, detection rate, FPR, and FNR. However, the accuracy has a small reduction when the number of vehicles under attack changes from 10% to 50%. While this reduction and the loss in performance is quite small, implying good scalability of our design.</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are multiple important hyper-parameters in the design of a neural network, among which the batch size is important and crucial when we are dealing with GRU where prediction of future time slots is performed based on input values. For a given design, we optimize our network such that for each input sequence, the GRU model must provide a good prediction accuracy for an output prediction sequence with a size equal to 10% of input. As an example, if the input sequence is of size 100 then the model must maintain good prediction accuracy for output of size 10 (i.e. 10% of 100). Fig. <a href="#S6.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ VI-C2 Impact of Batch Size ‣ VI-C Results ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ GFCL: A GRU-based Federated Continual Learning Framework against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoV" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> shows the training loss for local and global models against different batch sizes. We study five different batch sizes and compare the performance among them. According to our experimental results, with an increase in batch size, training loss increases. This is due to the fact that the size of the prediction set also increases and impacts the average performance of the network. To maintain a good balance of lower training loss and a bigger set of predictions, we choose to use a batch size of 200 in our experiments.</p>

The performance of FPR in the Rome city environment is significant where no false positives are reported. The accuracy and detection rate achieved is also noteworthy for both cities, where even with 50% of vehicles under attack, the average accuracy doesn’t fall below 86% and 80% for Rome and Beijing city, respectively, and the average detection rate doesn’t fall below 71% and 69% Rome and Beijing city, respectively.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we addressed the problem of Sybil-based data poisoning attacks in the context of DRL-based IoV applications. We use the GRU-based regression model to predict the future data sequence to analyze and detect illegitimate behavior from vehicles. Typically, an anomaly detection mechanism on a single node with limited data may suffer from low sensitivity or high false positives when a wide variety of vehicle behavior is captured. Therefore, we proposed to integrate federated learning with GRU to widen the knowledge and enhance the performance of the anomaly detection framework. We evaluated our framework on several real-world vehicle mobility traces. We carried out an extensive set of experiments to demonstrate low training loss and high detection accuracy of illegitimate nodes for different fractions of vehicles under attack. We also verified the scalability of our design with good performance in different city environments.</p>
