<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Enabled by the increasing availability of sensor data monitored from production machinery, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance methods are key
pillars for an efficient and robust manufacturing production cycle in the Industrial Internet of Things. The employment of machine learning models to detect and predict
deteriorating behavior by analyzing a variety of data collected across several industrial environments shows promising results in recent works, yet also often requires transferring
the sensor data to centralized servers located in the cloud. Moreover, although collaborating and sharing knowledge between industry sites yields large benefits,
especially in the area of condition monitoring, it is often prohibited due to data privacy issues.
To tackle this situation, we propose an Autoencoder-based Federated Learning method utilizing vibration sensor data from rotating machines, that allows for a distributed training on edge devices,
located on-premise and close to the monitored machines. Preserving data privacy and at the same time exonerating possibly unreliable network connections of remote sites, our approach enables
knowledge transfer across organizational boundaries, without sharing the monitored data.
We conducted an evaluation utilizing two real-world datasets as well as multiple testbeds and the results indicate that our method enables a competitive performance compared to previous results,
while significantly reducing the resource and network utilization.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The amount of distributed devices, sensors and connectivity in the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasing steadily and has a decisive impact on a vast variety of application domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Especially in the area of Industry 4.0, the ever-increasing velocity and volume of data generated by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices combined with sophisticated analysis jobs can benefit the operational efficiency and manufacturing process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and subsequently enable intelligent industrial operations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to enhance the reliability and allow for a cost effective maintenance, data generated by sensors directly connected to production machinery is often utilized by condition monitoring (CM) strategies to predict failures and identify abnormal behavior <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. CM employs a wide range of sensor components , i.e. vibration and temperature sensors, to monitor system characteristics from different domains, model the system behavior and detect i.e. outliers in the data, indicating a damage or degradation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
This is especially important when considering that failures can have a significant and cascading impact on i.e. the manufacturing production cycle or the overall operation, which in turn results in the loss of profit and possibly high maintenance costs. An early detection of a failure can lead to a faster repair and reduced follow-up costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, the data is sent to external servers or the cloud and subsequently used to run analysis jobs like machine learning models, since plain sensors are not offering enough resources. As industry sites are often located far away from actual cloud data centers, the network capabilities might be limited and for instance affected by high latencies or bad network connectivity in general, resulting in congestion on the network link and delayed results. Furthermore, extending already existing industry environments is often done without introducing sophisticated network infrastructure to the cloud and instead mainly relies on remote and possibly unreliable communication means. Thus, especially for remote locations, that are i.e. only connected via 4G or satellite connections, the transmission of (training) data can also involve high costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although – due to the increasing prevalence of more powerful smart devices in edge and IIoT environments – the processing of data is progressively shifted to edge devices located in or in close proximity to industry sites, the actual training of the models is still often conducted in the cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Especially in the area of IIoT, the transmission of business-sensitive data to the cloud also results in data privacy issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which is why recently distributed machine learning paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL) gain in popularity for the IIoT. In FL, the models are trained locally – close to the actual data sources – and then aggregated to a global model without exchanging any training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
This enables the training of ML models in the organizational boundaries of IIoT sites while still allowing for the integration of knowledge of other faculties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, in our work we aim to combine condition monitoring technologies with the FL paradigm in order to enable an on-premise training of models directly in the respective IIoT sites, and an aggregation service located in the cloud, which facilitates an inter-site knowledge sharing.
In our paper, we are focusing on condition monitoring for rotating machines such as bearings or pumps and evaluate the resulting models in terms of condition monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities
on two real-world datasets as well as across different testbeds.</p>

<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Condition Monitoring &amp; Predictive Maintenance</h5>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Condition monitoring (CM) describes the field of monitoring and analyzing machines to deduct their current condition.
The condition of a machine is a critical information to plan a manual intervention or perform a maintenance task ahead of time, before a machine failure occurs.
Among a variety of approaches, modelling the normal behavior of the machine by incorporating sensor measurements into AI models has gained momentum in recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Often consisting of multiple sensory features such as temperature, vibration, or sound, the sensor data streams can be analyzed using machine learning to detect unexpected behavior in the machine, signaling a need to intervene.
Points that deviate too far from the learned normal behavior can be viewed as anomalies in the data, rendering CM a subclass of the anomaly detection problem.
As the goal of CM is to support and improve the manual labor of domain experts, supervised learning approaches requiring fully labeled data are oftentimes not feasible in real-world applications.
This absence of labeled data poses a major challenge for machine learning models used in unsupervised CM, as they are not able to directly learn by comparison of their results against the ground truth of the data, in contrast to traditional machine learning architectures. Therefore, the normal behavior of the data is modeled and deviations are considered as anomalies.</p>

Hereby, the sensor readings are analyzed with different goals like the modeling or prediction of future development of the time series where the application of ML has been widely adapted.
Within this environment, Long Short-Term Memory neurons (LSTM) are especially suited for time-dependent contexts as they model the behavior of the process generating a time series by holding to the most relevant information.</p>

Similar to our work, they propose a LSTM-Autoencoder based approach which exploits the time-dependence between batches to reconstruct the signal of high frequency accelerometer readings
and subsequently detect abnormal behavior. Their evaluation showed promising results and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. Nevertheless, they rely on transmitting all sensory
data to a central server where the training is conducted on all monitored data, involving significant resources and therefore rendering it not feasible for an on-premise setup on lightweight edge devices in a remote industry site.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>We envision an environment consisting of several IIoT sites, in which rotating machines are monitored with vibration sensors. Each site has one or multiple edge devices which train a model on the locally available sensor data and share the updated model weights with an aggregation node that in turn averages the weights to a global model that is finally distributed to the sites again.</figcaption>

Multiple remotely located IIoT sites employ machinery with rotating components such as bearings, pumps or blades and are connected to the internet using a low-bandwidth connection.
Due to the wide availability of affordable sensors, these IIoT systems can be equipped with accelerometers, measuring i.e. vibrations of the machines.
Such measurements are often taken in batches, as a permanent recording is too costly in terms of energy management and detoriation of the sensor.
In addition, changes in the behavior of rotating machines, e.g. originating in the wear of a bearing, are expected to happen within days or hours and not within seconds.
Finally, the recorded vibration data can be used to detect a variety of possible anomalies like bearing faults, misalignments, or cavitation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, we propose a FL-based approach to train the vibration data recorded on edge devices located in the IIoT site, which comes with several advantages and synergies:
The recorded data can stay locally as the training is not performed in the cloud.
Thus, the communication overhead is reduced to only share the model parameters instead of all recorded data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, anomaly data is very sparse for each individual machine.
This means that of all possible anomalies, only a small fraction on each individual machine will be observed within its life span.
Transferring learned knowledge about either normal or abnormal behavior between machines is an inherent strength of the FL approach as the global model aggregates modelled information from a variety of machines, thus sharing the knowledge of a multitude of sensor measurements in different sites or environments.</p>

A set of samples belonging to one measurement – marked by a common timestamp – is considered a batch.

The Autoencoder consists of two parts, an encoder and a decoder, which both consist of a variable number of sequentially aligned LSTM-Layers.
In our proposed Autoencoder, the input is time series data from the vibration measurements themselves.
The LSTM layers are used to provide the model with the ability to understand the sequential aspect of time series data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.

This change was made, as working on the level of single measurements requires significantly less memory usage compared to including multiple complete batch measurements into the CM model, and therefore directly benefits our <em id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">efficiency</em> requirement.</p>

Internally, the LSTM layers pass their entire output sequence to the following layer to provide them with their full interpretation of the data.
In terms of the encoder, a final inner LSTM layer encodes the output of the last LSTM-layer into the reduced encoding size.
For the decoder, the output of the encoding LSTM-layer is passed through the hidden LSTM layers into the final Dense layer which reconstructs the encoded time series.</p>

The data was measured for 1 second every 10 minutes with a sampling rate of 20,480 Hertz, and the whole dataset consists of three independent run-to-failure experiments (<em id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Set1-3</em>) in which the bearings were monitored until a failure occurred.
Therefore, at the end of each experiment, a subset of the monitored bearings develops a degrading health state.

The results for F1 score, precision, and recall are nearly identical for the majority.
As the proposed approach works on smaller windows of the associated time series, our FL trained model is able to predict for a larger group of rotating machines.
Thus, we could include the RM-1 although it initially uses a different batch size, since the proposed model is not limited by it, contrary to the baseline.
Evidently, it is important to mention that only very few anomalies exists in the RM datasets, resulting in an average F1-score of 99.4%.
Nevertheless, the achieved results are encouraging as the performance of the model is very competitive despite the much lower complexity compared to the baseline model.</p>

The performance measures thereby achieved similar results to the full training runs.
Thus, also Raspberry Pis are able to train with the amount of data in a reasonable amount of time.

Depending on the size of the dataset, the FL workers require between 2 and 3GB of main memory to conduct a local model training. In comparison,
the baseline needs about 9 to 11GB of memory in average per dataset, thus rendering it not feasible for the execution on IIoT devices.
Even more significant is the reduction in overall network utilization: In case of the FL approach, only model weights have to be communicated between the training and aggregation nodes, resulting in around 6.3MB for each tested machine and 25 training rounds.
The baseline requires transmission of all training data to the central server, depicted as <em id="S4.SS6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Raw</em> in <a href="#S4.F13" title="In IV-F Runtime and resource utilization ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning for Autoencoder-based Condition Monitoring in the Industrial Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>, which in consequence enables a reduction of the overall network usage from up to 99.2%.

</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In terms of general condition monitoring a variety of related work exist. For instance,
Sakib et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> achieved low-latency condition monitoring inference by deploying pre-trained models to IIoT devices. In their approach, the models are trained on centralized servers and the IIoT devices are only used for inference.
Hahn and Mechefske <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> utilized a self-supervised approach of Condition Monitoring using a Variational-Autoencoder on the NASA milling data set, which does not require feature engineering and shows promising results on some parameters.
In addition, Mostafavi and Sadighi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed a condition monitoring framework which is fully located on IIoT devices.
Their framework, like ours, uses an LSTM-Autoencoder for anomaly detection while being resource-restricted.
These approaches, while overcoming the resource restriction, lack the advantages that FL has to offer, as they do not keep the data in the local sites nor do they share information between multiple devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In regards to FL approaches, Wang et al. and Yunfan et al. developed two generalized frameworks, In-Edge AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and EdgeFed<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, for improving FL at the edge. They explore different approaches to reduce the system communication load and partly offload resource-intensive work to the cloud to archive a more effective aggregation.
Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a framework for mitigating issues of strong heterogeneity by the usage of personalized FL methods.
Dhada et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> used a FL approach for determining the remaining useful life of engines on a simulated turbofan data set, a topic strongly related to the basic idea of condition monitoring also using rotating machines.
Our work, in contrast, deals with the application of such a use case while considering the resource limitation of edge devices, especially within an IIoT environment.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> developed a blockchain-based FL solution for condition monitoring in the IIoT.
Their approach included a novel weighted federated averaging algorithm to mitigate the data heterogeneity issue and the utilization of smart contracts for client incentives.
We neglect utilizing a blockchain approach, since it would introduces new additional computational overhead.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we presented an Autoencoder-based Federated Learning approach for efficient condition monitoring of rotating machines in IIoT environments, utilizing monitored vibration data.
Our method enables a collaborative and distributed model training on lightweight edge devices that are located in close proximity to the sensor data sources in industrial sites.
While first learning to reconstruct the normal behaviour of the monitored sensor streams, it allows for an unsupervised anomaly detection based on reconstruction errors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The conducted evaluation on two real-world datasets shows a competitive performance compared to a state of the art baseline and at the same time decreases the complexity enough to qualify low-powered edge devices as training nodes. Moreover, the network utilization is decreased by up to 99.22%, further benefiting remote industry sites with possibly unreliable or expensive network connections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we plan to evaluate our method on additional datasets and to test further weight averaging algorithms.</p>
