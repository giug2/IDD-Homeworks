<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone transformative changes with the advent of deep learning methodologies. One challenge persistently confronting researchers is the scarcity of high-quality, annotated datasets that drive these models. This paper explores the nuances of synthetic data generation in NLP, with a focal point on template-based question generation. By assessing its advantages, including data augmentation potential and the introduction of structured variety, we juxtapose these benefits against inherent limitations, such as the risk of overfitting and the constraints posed by pre-defined templates. Drawing from empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the impact of template-based synthetic data on the performance of modern transformer models. We conclude by emphasizing the delicate balance required between synthetic and real-world data, and the future trajectories of integrating synthetic data in model training pipelines. The findings aim to guide NLP practitioners in harnessing synthetic data’s potential, ensuring optimal model performance in diverse applications.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the burgeoning field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), acquiring substantial data for training and fine-tuning models is a continual challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vaswani et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. While real-world annotated datasets are invaluable, their availability is often constrained, making them expensive to produce, and they can sometimes carry inherent biases from their collection methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bowman et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. This context underscores the potential of synthetic data generation techniques, with synthetic question-answer pairs emerging as a notable subset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rajpurkar et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. Among the diverse strategies available, template-based question generation, recognized for its rule-driven approach, provides a systematic avenue for data generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, as with many techniques in the realm of computational linguistics, the adoption of template-based generation in transformer models within NLP presents a complex landscape to navigate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Devlin et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. This paper seeks to illuminate the intricacies of this approach, offering insights into its methodologies, advantages, and inherent limitations. Through our examination, our aim is to equip readers with a nuanced understanding of the technique, its impact on transformer architectures, and the potential avenues for its evolution in NLP research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The implementation of template-based question generation for creating synthetic question-answer pairs can significantly impact the performance of a LLM in several ways:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<ol id="S1.I1" class="ltx_enumerate">
<li id="S1.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">1.</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data Augmentation: The most direct impact is the increase in training data. When you create synthetic question-answer pairs from existing text, you’re effectively augmenting your dataset, which can be particularly useful when dealing with tasks where the amount of available labeled data is limited. This increased data volume helps the model better understand language patterns and variations, which can enhance the model’s ability to generalize, ultimately improving performance.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="S1.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">2.</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Exposure to Diverse Structures: Template-based question generation exposes the transformer model to a wider variety of question structures and types. This increased exposure helps the model develop a more comprehensive understanding of language and better performance on a broader range of questions.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="S1.I1.i3" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">3.</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Model Robustness: By creating synthetic data that includes a variety of linguistic features and structures, the model becomes more robust. It will be less likely to overfit to the training data, and it will perform better when encountering previously unseen data, increasing its robustness and reliability.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="S1.I1.i4" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">4.</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Bias Mitigation: Synthetic data can help to mitigate biases in the original dataset by introducing more balanced and diverse examples. This can make the model’s predictions less skewed and more reliable.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, it’s important to note that while these potential benefits are significant, they are not guaranteed. The quality of the synthetic question-answer pairs is crucial. If the generated synthetic data is of low quality or doesn’t accurately reflect the kinds of questions and answers the model will encounter in the real world, it might instead negatively impact the model’s performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kim et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, while template-based question generation can create a diverse range of questions, it’s inherently limited by the predefined templates. Therefore, it may not capture all possible ways of phrasing questions or handling complex sentence structures. For these reasons, template-based generation is often used in conjunction with other question generation methods or with fine-tuning on real-world data to ensure that the transformer model is well-prepared for the task at hand.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been a major area of research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
since the early days of computer science <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Voorhees et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>; Moldovan et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>; Brill et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>; Ferrucci et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Gholami and Noori, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Gholami et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Gholami and Khashe, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>; Brand et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Gholami and Omar, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">c</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>)</cite>. There are numerous works of leveraging synthetic data to create efficient Transformer models in the literature. In this section we go over a few notable cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the real world, there is plenty of unlabeled data. However, it could be challenging to locate task-specific unlabeled data that fits the criteria of a particular machine-learning scenario. In particular, it is challenging to locate in-domain unlabeled text that complies with a particular Natural Language Processing system’s probability model. To produce an enhanced subset of features, additional data is often included with the existing training sample in classical data augmentation. Furthermore, labeled ambiguity can harm training if combined with data generated using a generative model. Additionally, the created queries may need to be more logical and clear noise. Yang et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> addressed the problem by providing a straightforward training method that handles natural and synthetic information separately. They initially build a model by using artificial data and afterward refine it using the original, human-created training dataset. For computer vision, dataset augmentation frequently leads to the formation of visual modifications like translational and rotational.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Data augmentation is more difficult for language applications. Back-translation configurations, heuristic analysis based on text’s semantic and syntactic characteristics, such as phrase replacement options using a word list, and more lately, generative algorithms for replicating new and more effective instances for character recognition and reading ability, have all generally been employed in preceding experimental tools. To enhance the functionality of detectors, Tavor et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Anaby-Tavor et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> present the LAMBADA learning algorithm is adjusted and created additional labeled-condition phrases involving the filtering step. They demonstrated that their approach significantly enhances classifiers’ performance on smaller data sets. Furthermore, they demonstrated that LAMBADA outperforms cutting-edge methods for data augmentation.
Alberti et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Alberti et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> introduced a new technique for creating synthetic Question Answer examples and showed how this information improved SQuAD2 as well as NQ. Furthermore, they suggested a potential course of action for this methodology’s logical foundation, which will be explored further in later studies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several new techniques for synthetic data production analysis of large pretrained language algorithms have begun to show results in enhancing the progress of the Reading Cognition test with artificially generated data. Given the limited amount of human-labeled data, a set of questions and their answers creation is a data augmentation technique used to enhance question-answering (QA) frameworks. In order to develop a BERT-Large model to attain comparable question-answering efficiency while explicitly utilizing any actual information, Puri et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Puri et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> constructed artificial content using a Wikipedia-fine tuned GPT-2 system that generates response alternatives as well as artificial queries dependent upon these responses.</p>

<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we focus on adding synthetic data to the model introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gholami and Omar (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023a</a>)</cite> (GPT-Efficio) as the baseline along with bigger GPT-3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Brown et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> model.</p>

<div id="S3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">While template-based question generation can be a powerful tool for creating synthetic question-answer pairs, it does have limitations. It’s typically rule-based, meaning it may struggle with complex or ambiguous sentences that don’t fit neatly into its predefined templates. Moreover, the diversity of the generated questions is limited to the predefined templates. This is why more advanced, machine-learning-based question generation techniques are also used, often in conjunction with template-based methods, to generate a wider range of question types and handle more complex sentence structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome these limitations, modern approaches often employ transformer-based models or sequence-to-sequence models that are cble of learning the complex mappings from source sentences to questions from large amounts of training data. Nevertheless, template-based question generation still plays a crucial role, particularly in scenarios with limited data or where interpretability and control over the generation process are important.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By artificially creating data that closely mimics genuine datasets, the potential to enrich training sets and address data scarcity becomes tangible. Yet, as with all innovations, its efficacy is contingent on context and application.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For language modeling tasks, synthetic data generation might appear as a beacon of promise on the surface. Here we have a chance to artificially bolster the data pool, potentially leading to better-trained models capable of understanding and predicting linguistic structures. However, the reality reveals a different narrative. The inherent nature of language modeling, where the task revolves around predicting subsequent words in sentences or deciphering intricate linguistic patterns, demands a nuanced and authentic representation of the language. Synthetic data, even when finely crafted, may not capture the intricate unpredictability and vastness of natural language. Consequently, its inclusion often results in minimal to negligible improvements in model accuracy and fluency. This could be attributed to various factors, including the potential for synthetic data to introduce noise or fail to capture the linguistic variances found in genuine, human-generated text.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the contrary, when examining question generation tasks, synthetic data generation has shown to be of greater relevance. Unlike the broad scope of language modeling, question generation is more constrained, relying on structured formats and specific linguistic cues. Given its rule-based nature, synthetic data can be tailored to this task more effectively, providing models with a plethora of varied question formats and structures. Our investigations indicate that, while the improvements might not be groundbreaking, there is a discernible enhancement in the model’s ability to generate coherent and relevant questions when trained with a blend of real and synthetic data. It’s possible that the structured nature of questions allows synthetic generation techniques to produce data that is more aligned with the inherent patterns of question formulation, hence the observed performance boost.</p>

This can be particularly useful when dealing with tasks where the amount of available labeled data is limited. It can help expose the model to a wider variety of scenarios and edge cases, making the model more robust. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Brown et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Determining the right balance typically involves empirical testing. Starting with a lower ratio of synthetic to real data and gradually increasing it, monitoring the model’s performance on a validation dataset. A good strategy is to use cross-validation or a hold-out validation set to tune this hyperparameter, similar to other forms of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dathathri et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. This approach can help ensure that the chosen ratio leads to the best possible model performance.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The approach of synthetic data generation in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly using template-based question generation, does come with certain limitations that can impact its effectiveness. Here are some key limitations to consider:</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Quality of Synthetic Data: One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that the synthetic data generated is of high quality and closely mirrors the statistical properties of real-world data. If the synthetic data is of poor quality or does not accurately reflect the kinds of questions and answers the model will encounter in real-world situations, it can negatively impact the model’s performance.</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Limited Diversity: Template-based question generation relies on predefined question templates. While this approach can produce a wide range of questions, it’s inherently limited by the number and types of templates used. This method may not capture all possible ways of phrasing questions or handling complex sentence structures, which can limit the diversity of the generated questions.</p>

<div id="S6.I1.i3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Lack of Nuance: Template-based generation can struggle to capture the nuances of natural language, particularly for complex sentences or subtleties in meaning. This is because it uses a relatively rigid, rule-based method to create questions, which can fail to account for context-dependent nuances in how questions might be phrased.</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Risk of Overfitting: There’s a risk that the model will overfit to the patterns in the synthetic data, especially if a high ratio of synthetic to real data is used. This can lead to the model performing poorly on real-world data, as it may have learned patterns that are not representative of real-world language use.</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Annotation Quality: If synthetic data generation includes an annotation process (for instance, automatically generating labels for synthetic data), the quality of these annotations is crucial. Errors in annotation can introduce noise into the training data, which can negatively impact the model’s performance.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While these limitations pose challenges, they can be mitigated by using synthetic data generation in conjunction with other techniques. For instance, combining template-based question generation with more flexible, machine-learning-based methods can help to generate a wider variety of questions. Also, fine-tuning the model on real-world data after initial training on synthetic data can help to avoid overfitting. Ultimately, the careful design of the synthetic data generation process and rigorous validation of model performance are key to effectively using this approach.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) stands at an intriguing crossroads, with synthetic data generation emerging as a powerful ally in addressing data scarcity and model generalization challenges. Our exploration of template-based question generation has elucidated both its potential and the caveats that accompany its use. The augmentation cbilities it brings to the table can significantly bolster model training, especially in scenarios where real-world annotated datasets are sparse. Yet, the inherent rigidity of templates and the potential for overfitting demand a judicious and well-calibrated approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The interplay between synthetic and real-world data is a delicate balance. As demonstrated, the ratio between the two can substantially influence a transformer model’s performance, emphasizing the necessity for meticulous empirical tuning. Moreover, while template-based strategies offer streamlined data generation, they ought to be integrated with other synthetic data techniques to ensure comprehensive model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Looking forward, as NLP continues its trajectory of rapid innovation, synthetic data generation’s role will undoubtedly evolve. Researchers and practitioners should remain cognizant of the ever-shifting dynamics between real and synthetic data. Continuous evaluation, adaptive strategies, and openness to hybrid methodologies will be the bedrock upon which the next wave of NLP breakthroughs will be founded. The journey of integrating synthetic data in NLP is replete with both challenges and opportunities, beckoning the community to navigate its complexities with discernment and creativity.</p>
