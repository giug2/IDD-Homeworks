<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning mechanism which still faces two major challenges, namely privacy breaches and system efficiency. In this work, we reconceptualize the FL system from the perspective of network information theory, and formulate an original FL communication framework, FedNC, which is inspired by Network Coding (NC). The main idea of FedNC is mixing the information of the local models by making random linear combinations of the original parameters, before uploading for further aggregation. Due to the benefits of the coding scheme, both theoretical and experimental analysis indicate that FedNC improves the performance of traditional FL in several important ways, including security, efficiency, and robustness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework where NC is introduced in FL. As FL continues to evolve within practical network frameworks, more variants can be further designed based on FedNC.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data privacy and system efficiency are becoming more and more important in machine learning with the advent of the Big Data era. As a promising distributed learning framework, Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful learning mechanism where local clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a central server while keeping the data decentralized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Unlike centralized learning that requires all data to be pooled for training, FL only needs the interaction of model parameters (or gradients) while the training data remains localized, which greatly improves the security and availability of the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since its introduction in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, FL has taken on a crucial role in the 6th Generation or 6G system as the combination of distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) and communication networks has been receiving increasing attention.
Specifically, FL demonstrates its great potential in deep learning, naturally fitting the decentralized structure of multi-user networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and multi-agent reinforcement learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In addition, various frameworks have been derived from the classic FL architecture, such as decentralized FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, hierarchical FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and layer-wise pruning FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In the future, FL can also be considered in physical layer cases, i.e., multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and energy harvesting technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, despite the fact that FL was originally proposed to protect the data privacy, there is still the possibility of exposing important information during the communication between the local clients and the central server. For model aggregations, clients generally pass the local model parameters to the server over an open channel. If a malicious attack occurs during the transmission, the attacker may be able to steal the model parameters and obtain raw information from the clients, which may include hospital patient data, bank deposit information, company trade secrets, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The communication bottleneck is also another major challenge in FL systems. The wireless open channel and numerous participating clients, along with the heterogeneity of local data and training devices, amplify communication costs and instability compared to traditional distributed setups with stable wired connections. These factors result in reduced efficiency and robustness. Moreover, a failed model upload from a client forces the FL system to wait for re-upload, wasting time, or to discard parameters, risking errors due to data heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Given the above, it is clear that privacy breaches and system efficiency are two major challenges that need to be addressed urgently in FL.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Numerous researches have been investigated to enhance the security of FL systems in the literature. <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Differential Privacy</span> (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> introduces the controllable noise into raw data, aiming to protect the privacy of individual data. Geyer <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed an algorithm for client sided DP preserving federated optimization via the Gaussian noise mechanism. Agarwal <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> provided convergence guarantees for DP under both Binomial mechanism and Gaussian mechanism.
However, all these approaches ensure a certain level of security at the expense of accuracy. Moreover, <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">homomorphic encryption</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> can also protect data privacy in limited scenarios by exchanging encrypted parameters during the learning process, although the extra encryption and approximation will result in trade-offs between accuracy and security. <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Secure multiparty computation</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> enables multiple agents to establish a secure function that guarantees no information leakage except its input and output, but due to the excessive communication and computational costs, along with the necessity for carefully designed protocols for different tasks, it is not suitable for large-scale machine learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">coded computation</span> can also be used to improve the robustness and efficiency of FL. Prakash <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a novel framework, CodedFedL, which adds coding schemes into federated system for mitigating stragglers and speeding up the training procedure. Anand <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> improved the data privacy by adding Gaussian noise to the coded data, but they failed to exploit the local computational resources for fast training as the gradient computation on the server is restricted. Sun <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a stochastic coded FL framework which involved random linear combination of the local data, sharing the similar idea with CodedFedL. However, the problem of coded FL system lies in the necessity to share parity data of local clients to the central server, thereby introducing supplementary communication costs. It also imposes increased demands on the computational resources of the central server, not only requiring it to perform parameter aggregation, but also to compute partial gradient from the composite parity data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the mechanism of the coded federated systems as well as the similar topology between FL system and network structure, we first combine the FL with <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Network Coding</span> (NC) and propose FedNC, a novel FL framework that enhances both the security and robustness of the federated system without losing accuracy and efficiency.
Ahlswede <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> showed that NC achieves maximal throughput of a multicast network, improving the network’s efficiency and scalability, while Li <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proved that Linear Network Coding (LNC) is sufficient to achieve the max-flow from the source to destinations in multicast problems, so the receivers merely decode linearly independent combinations to obtain the original packets, not requiring persistently stable channels, thereby enhancing the robustness. Furthermore, LNC has the added benefit of security, since the attackers can only decode the packets if they have received a sufficient number of linearly independent encoded packets.
As a result, NC provides advantages aligning well with FL’s challenges.</p>

It is worth mentioning that to address the difficulty of representing any real numbers in finite field, a common approach is to adapt the training process to make the (over)underflows controllable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, such as by operating on quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. However, this is beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned earlier, the main idea of FedNC is mixing the information of the local model parameters before aggregation. There are multiple ways to achieve the mixing. For instance, one can utilize the structure of hierarchical FL where local clients encode their parameters at trusted edge servers before uploading them to the central server. Alternatively, a fully decentralized FL machanism can also be employed, naturally incorporating encoding into the process as parameters are transmitted between users. It’s assumed that the mixing procedure typically occurs in nearby cells or closed channels, ensuring that it remains immune to attacks or eavesdropping.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For simplicity, we consider the local parameters uploaded by each client as a packet. When the local training is finished, the participating clients will send their original packets for random linear combinations to get the encoded packets. Afterwards, the encoded packets will be uploaded to the central server, where they are decoded to get the original packets again to perform the subsequent model aggregation. Finally, the global model is updated at the central server and distributed to all local clients.</p>

The advantage of FedNC comes into play when we model the channel as real and complex networks instead of point-to-point links. When we obtain packets from real networks such as the Internet, we do not select packets from specific sources, but receive all that we can. If we model the process of acquiring packets as random sampling, a specific packet will become rare for the receiver.

For this problem, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> theoretically considered a feasible multicast system on a (possibly cyclic) network, and gave a lower bound on the probablity of successful recovery.

For the iid case, the blind box effect is not obvious due to the fact that each client possesses uniform data. Despite the fact that the convergence of FedNC is a bit slower due to decoding failures, one can observe that FedNC converges to the same optimum with <math id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathtt{FedAvg}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">𝙵𝚎𝚍𝙰𝚟𝚐</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝙵𝚎𝚍𝙰𝚟𝚐</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1c">\mathtt{FedAvg}</annotation></semantics></math> since the final test results are very close. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that for the mixed non-iid case, FedNC has very obvious advantages over classical FL, e.g., it converges faster and reaches a better accuracy. On the one hand, the non-iid property exacerbates the blind box effect of <math id="S4.SS2.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathtt{FedAvg}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">𝙵𝚎𝚍𝙰𝚟𝚐</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝙵𝚎𝚍𝙰𝚟𝚐</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.4.m4.1c">\mathtt{FedAvg}</annotation></semantics></math>, making the outcome less accurate. On the other hand, thanks to the random coding characteristics of FedNC, the server can use packets from different clients for every successful aggregation. As a result, the coding mechanism significantly alleviates the drawbacks caused by the blind box effect while enhancing both the robustness and the efficiency.</p>

However, it is notable that with lower participation rates, the advantage of FedNC becomes more evident, as the test accuracy of FedNC decreases less than classical FL under both data distributions, while converging even faster. This improvement results from the fact that the central server receives linear combinations in FedNC. Thus, on average there are more clients participating in the aggregation per round, and this superiority becomes more apparent when the participation rate is low. The experimental results are instructive because they highlight the advantages of FedNC in large-scale FL training, which is more indicative of practical systems.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we considered NC in the context of FL, and proposed an original FL framework, FedNC, which encodes the packets before transmission to optimize security and efficiency. We designed the basic structure and algorithm for FedNC, illustrated several advantages of FedNC over the conventional FL, and theoretically portrayed the blind box effect that conventional FL suffers. Estimation for the error probability’s upper bound of FedNC was also derived. The experimental results demonstrated that FedNC can significantly improve the robustness and efficiency compared to traditional FL systems, especially in non-iid cases and large-scale situations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, FedNC based works can be developed in several aspects. Firstly, the analysis of the convergence rate will be an important extension. Secondly, the theoretical description of FedNC’s security guarantees is worth studying. Finally, richer experiments are needed to further explore FedNC’s potentials for system efficiency and robustness.</p>
