<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has evolved as a prominent method for edge devices to cooperatively create a unified prediction model while securing their sensitive training data local to the device. Despite the existence of numerous research frameworks for simulating FL algorithms, they do not facilitate comprehensive deployment for automatic speech recognition tasks on heterogeneous edge devices. This is where Ed-Fed, a comprehensive and generic FL framework, comes in as a foundation for future practical FL system research. We also propose a novel resource-aware client selection algorithm to optimise the waiting time in the FL settings. We show that our approach can handle the straggler devices and dynamically set the training time for the selected devices in a round. Our evaluation has shown that the proposed approach significantly optimises waiting time in FL compared to conventional random client selection methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the advances in hardware and software technologies, edge devices are becoming increasingly powerful and intelligent. This enables the researchers to bring machine intelligence from cloud-based data centres to edge devices such as mobile phones. For instance, Google Pixel’s “Now Playing” option which allows us to recognise any song without internet and “recorder” app with on-device speaker diarization show how powerful the mobile phones are becoming. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> introduces an additional dimension in the machine learning community in which models are collaboratively trained on edge devices, with the data remaining local to the device, in contrast to the centralised training approach, and hence ensures the data privacy of the users.
A general FL setting consists of a set of clients (edge devices) and a server. The server randomly chooses a subset of the devices from the available ones that want to take part in the FL round. A copy of the global model, which the server maintains, is first sent to this subset of clients. These clients use their data in the device to train models locally, and then send the updated weights back to the server. In conventional FL, the server cannot move on to the next step until it has received updates from every client. As a result, FL performance is constrained by the variability in waiting time experienced by each client due to model training on the device or communication delay during the transfer of model weights to the server.
These slowdowns caused by the clients with weaker network connections or limited computation capabilities is known as “straggler effect”. Once the server gets the updates from all the selected clients, the weights are aggregated using a strategy. This process is repeated for several rounds until the global model achieves the desired accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The random client selection approach for FL works well when there are no straggler devices. Prioritising for resource rich devices every time will result in the inability of straggler devices to participate in the FL process, and can lead to a loss of generalisation in the global model and fairness in the learning process. To address this challenge, a more sophisticated client selection algorithm is needed that considers the presence of stragglers while minimising waiting time. Hence the algorithm should aim to balance the participation of straggler devices with less waiting time and fairness in the FL process. Current FL frameworks face several challenges when it comes to deployment on edge devices such as mobile phones. These devices often have limited memory and computational resources, which makes it difficult to store and execute complex models. To overcome the existing challenges and make FL a practical and scalable solution for edge devices, it is important to develop FL frameworks that are designed specifically for these devices, taking into account their computational, privacy, and power constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We provide a methodology for training the models on the device, along with an efficient client selection algorithm to handle straggler devices and FL functionalities, allowing them to be deployed on edge devices for FL settings. We also monitor the client devices’ resources to ensure that they continue to function seamlessly even in dynamic environments.
Since this work is related to client selection, we do not consider asynchronous federated learning approaches.
In this paper, we focus on the use case of automatic speech recognition (ASR), demonstrating how our FL framework can be used to improve the accuracy and robustness of speech recognition models.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FL Framework </span>Recently, there has been a lot of interest in training ASR models in FL settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Implementing ASR for federated settings in mobile phones is a challenge in itself due to the complex model architectures and dynamic nature of the speech signals, as well as the limited resources available in mobile devices.
Furthermore, due to factors such as noisy backgrounds, multiple accented speech, and different voice characteristics such as gender, pitch, phonation, loudness and tempo, the local speech data available on devices are non-IID in nature. This further complicates the training of ASR models. Several FL frameworks, including TensorFlow-Federated (TFF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and LEAF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, support only the simulation of FL systems and do not propose an edge device deployment. Flower framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, on the other hand, supports extending FL settings to edge devices. However, we can see that the ASR task with the flower framework is also limited to system-level simulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Moreover, they provide only transfer learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> but not entire retraining of the model from scratch. To the best of our knowledge, no existing framework has provided a comprehensive implementation of ASR on-device training, as well as FL settings for mobile phones.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Client selection </span> We focus mainly on bandit based client selection techniques in FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors formulated the client selection as a traditional multi-arm bandit based problem to select clients with better quality of data to improve the FL accuracy. The authors proposed upper confidence bound based client selection in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> with the goal of reducing the overall time consumption of FL training including transmission time and local computation time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors intelligently select clients by exploiting the data correlations among clients to improve FL learning performance. However, none of these studies used actual computation resource information from the devices to explain training latency. Meanwhile, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> took a similar approach to ours, taking into account resource information and grouping clients accordingly. Even though the clients with similar resources are selected together, the need for adaptive setting training epochs is needed to control the stragglers. Furthermore, they did not take the battery information into account, which is critical.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is critical to develop a better methodology for converting a larger global model to a memory efficient and optimised version suitable for edge devices. We use TensorFlow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to create a well-optimised Flatbuffer format based conversion, which allows for significant model size reduction. We use the signature functions in Tensorflow to interface with the optimised model and perform operations such as training, inference, loading and saving the checkpoint weights, as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

Typically, in real-world settings the client’s local data will not be representative of the global data distribution because of the noisy background or the different voice characteristics. Hence, simply aggregating weights from such clients with low quality data will lead to a deviation from the global model. An improved solution is to generate a weighted aggregation of the models, with a weighting coefficient reflecting the quality of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. A client with a higher word error rate (WER) denotes poor performance of the global model. In such cases, we assign a lower weighting coefficient to that model during the aggregation. We use a weighted WER-based strategy in our Ed-Fed setting and is denoted as follows:</p>

Obtaining context information from the phone before each FL round is important as time taken to complete the training process depends on it.
We make use of this information by training a neural network to understand these dependencies and predict the expected training time and battery charge consumption based on a context vector. Once, we get to estimate these two parameters of each client, we can group clients together in a manner that minimises the waiting time of each client.</p>

For example, consider two identical phones, one of which has been in use for 5 years and the other of which is brand new. However, if we calculate the training time and battery drop of both phones under similar contexts, they do not match. We see that the older phone performs badly and drains faster due to the aging of batteries. Also, it is dependent on how extensively the phone is used over time. If we use a single model, we miss out on these relationships, and the model gets confused if such clients exist in our rounds with degradation in performance.

The figure shows three line plots, each corresponding to different values of k. Each line plot shows how the global model performs on the global test set after each round of FL.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present Ed-Fed, a first-of-its-kind end-to-end federated learning framework that will serve as a foundation for future research in practical FL systems. We also propose a client selection algorithm that takes into account factors such as computation, storage, power, and device-specific capabilities to handle stragglers, optimise waiting time, and adapt training time based on resource information.
The framework has been thoroughly tested in simulations and on actual edge devices, and in the future, we plan to incorporate communication latency parameters to measure waiting time.</p>
