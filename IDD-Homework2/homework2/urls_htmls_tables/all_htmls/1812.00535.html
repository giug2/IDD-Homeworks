<p id="id17.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, i.e., a mobile edge computing framework for deep learning, is a recent advance in privacy-preserving machine learning, where the model is trained in a decentralized manner by the clients, i.e., data curators, preventing the server from directly accessing those private data from the clients. This learning mechanism significantly challenges the attack from the server side. Although the state-of-the-art attacking techniques that incorporated the advance of Generative adversarial networks (GANs) could construct class representatives of the global data distribution among all clients, it is still challenging to distinguishably attack a specific client (i.e., user-level privacy leakage), which is a stronger privacy threat to precisely recover the private data from a specific client. This paper gives the first attempt to explore user-level privacy leakage against the federated learning by the attack from a malicious server. We propose a framework incorporating GAN with a multi-task discriminator, which simultaneously discriminates category, reality, and client identity of input samples. The novel discrimination on client identity enables the generator to recover user specified private data. Unlike existing works that tend to interfere the training process of the federated learning, the proposed method works “invisibly” on the server side. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking approach and the superior to the state-of-the-art.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>This manuscript has been accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2019.</span></span></span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Increasingly, modern deep learning technique is beginning to emerge in the networking domain, such as a crowdsourced system for learning tasks.
But utilizing conventional centralized training methodology requires local storage of the crowdsourced data, which suffers from the high volume of traffic, highly computational demands and privacy concerns. For collectively reaping the benefits of the shared model trained from this rich data without the need to store it centrally, distributed learning framework was proposed, serving as a mobile edge computing framework for deep learning.
Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> proposed the collaborative learning DSSGD, where the data providers, i.e., clients, train locally on a shared model, and then the server will collect those local models/updates to estimate/update a global model instead of directly assessing the private data from clients. Then, the global model is sent back to clients, iterating the aforementioned local training process.
In the same token, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposed a variant of decentralized learning with higher efficiency. The key improvement lies in the way of updating the global model, i.e., DSSGD performs the aggregated update while the federated learning conducts the averaged update, which is more suitable for the commonly non-IID and unbalanced data distribution among clients in the real world. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Beyond Inferring Class Representatives: User-Level Privacy Leakage From Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> illustrates the framework of federated learning.</p>
</div>
<figure id="S1.F1" class="ltx_figure"><img src="/html/1812.00535/assets/x1.png" id="S1.F1.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_landscape" width="438" height="270" alt="Refer to caption">

The server sends the shared model to each client, which trains the shared model locally by its private data. Then, the update from each client is uploaded to the server, where those updates are aggregated/averaged to improve the shared model in a collaborative manor.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, recent works demonstrated that the collaborative learning is vulnerable to the inference attack, e.g., reconstruction attack and membership attack, by malicious servers/clients because the shared model is updated according to those private data, whose pattern is encoded into the model parameters. Therefore, if a corresponding decoder could be constructed, the private data or statistics will be recovered inversely. Under the assumption of a malicious server, Aono et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> partially recovered the private data based on the observation that the gradient of weights is proportional to that of the bias at the first layer of the model, and their radio approximates to the training input.
But it could only apply to a simplified setting where the training batch has only one sample.
Hitaj et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposed a GAN-based reconstruction attack against the collaborative learning by assuming a malicious client, which utilized the shared model as the discriminator to train a GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Eventually, the learned generator (equivalent to the decoder) will successfully mimic the training samples.
Although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> had demonstrated the effectiveness of GAN-based attack against DSSGD,
it presents mainly three limitations: 1) It would change the architecture of the shared model and introduce adversarial influence to the learning process, while the former unrealistically assumes a powerful malicious client, and the latter compromises the learning process. 2) The GAN-based attack suffers from performance degradation when attacks the federated learning because the adversarial influence introduced by the malicious client would become trivial after the average update. 3) In addition, the GAN-based attack could only infer class-wised representatives, which are generic samples characterizing class properties rather than the exact samples from the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by those drawbacks in existing reconstruction attacking techniques,
we propose a more generic, practical, and invisible attacking framework against the federated learning without affecting the learning process. In addition, we further target client-level privacy<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>In this paper, “user-level” and “client-level” are used interchangeably.</span></span></span>,
which is more challenging and empirically meaningful than globally recovering the data representatives that characterize the population distribution as in the GAN-based attack.
Instead of assuming a malicious client, the proposed method performs on the server side, which first explores the attack by a malicious server. Specifically, we adapt the original GAN to a multi-task scenario where reality, category, and identity of the target client are considered simultaneously.
On the one hand, performing additional tasks when training the GAN improves the quality of synthesized samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> without the necessity of modification on the shared model or compromising to the federated learning, achieving invisible attack. On the other hand, the novel task of discriminating client identity enables client-level privacy recovery.
For simplicity, the proposed framework is referred to as multi-task GAN for Auxiliary Identification (mGAN-AI).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The key novelty of
mGAN-AI is to compromise the client-level
privacy
that is defined as the client-dependent properties, which specifically characterize the corresponding client and distinguish the client from the others. The key of achieving the discrimination on client identity is to obtain data representatives from each individual client, such that the training of GAN can be supervised by the identity representatives, generating samples with specific identity (i.e., from a specific client). Since the client data is unaccessible, we adopt an optimization-based method to estimate such data representatives from those accessible updates from the clients. The mGAN-AI relaxes the assumption that clients own mutually exclusive class labels, achieving a more generic attack to the federated learning.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed learning frameworks can be categorized according to the updating mechanism of the shared model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> summarized the updates while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>
averaged the updates, which outperform asynchronous approaches in aspects of communication efficiency and privacy preservation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Existing works on privacy-preserving distributed learning mostly utilize either differential privacy mechanism (DP) or secure multi-party computation (MPC).
Pathak et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed a DP-based global classifier by aggregating the locally trained classifiers. Hamm et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> leveraged knowledge transfer from ensemble local models to a global differentially private model. DSSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> was the first collaborative learning mechanism dealing with practical distribution, which used sparse vector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to realize DP.
Recently, participant-level differentially private distributed learning method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>
was proposed to further protect the membership information of participants.
Utilizing MPC, Mohassel et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> presented the SecureML framework where a global model is trained on the clients’ encrypted data among two non-colluding servers. Other methods based on encryption include secure sum protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> that uses a tree topology, homomorphic encryption, and secure aggregation protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>

Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> mounted the attack by utilizing the difference between model outputs from training and non-training inputs, respectively.
Hayes et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> used GAN to detect overfitting of the target model and recognize inputs through the discriminator which could distinguish different data distributions.
Melis et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> first proposed the membership attack against the collaborative/federated learning and further inferred the properties by a batch property classifier.

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The server in the federated learning is assumed to be malicious, aiming to reconstruct private data of the victim, which refers to the target client, for implementing the client-level privacy attack.
The malicious server could either only analyze the periodic updates from the clients (i.e., <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">passive attack</span>), or even intentionally isolate the shared model trained by the victim to achieve more powerful attack (i.e., <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">active attack</span>).
By contrast, most existing attacks against the collaborative/federated learning assumed malicious clients, which are limited at the stage of recovering class-wised representatives rather than prying client-level privacy because the malicious clients can only access aggregated updates (contributed by all the clients) from the server, while client-level attack requires individual update from each client.
Although there are attacks targeting at certain clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, they impractical assumed that class labels of the clients are mutually different or required extra information of the target client, e.g., class labels or other client-wise properties.
More importantly, they would compromise the performance of the shared model. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> changed the training objective, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> changed the shared model and introduced mislabeled samples into the training. Considering the limitation and drawback of malicious clients, we assume a malicious server that would overcome all above problems.
The malicious server rigidly follows the rules of federated learning. Meanwhile, the passive and active attacks are performed without effecting on the learning process, i.e., shared model, objective, updates, etc.</p>

Intuitively, the encryption-based aggregation prevents the adversary from accessing the updates of the clients, thus preserving their privacy.
However, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which only accessed the aggregated updates, could compromise the clients’ privacy by introducing adversarial influence. In addition,
the encryption-based aggregation also prevents the server from evaluating the utility of clients’ updates, degrading the learning model when malicious clients exist.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> discussed the weakness of encryption-based protocol that it cannot guarantee the correctness of federated learning if there are malicious clients.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The principle of GAN is to train a discriminator on target data and generated data simultaneously. Eventually, the coupled generator would yield samples close to target ones.
In the proposed mGAN-AI, the idea of training a GAN is borrowed, but the malicious server cannot access the target data (i.e., client-level private data) in the scenario of federated learning.
However, the shared model is trained locally on each client, equivalent to training a discriminator (with the same structure as the shared model) on the target data. Intuitively, directly obtaining the target data to train a discriminator is equivalent to obtaining the network update after feeding the target data to the discriminator. In the federated learning, the only accessible information to the malicious server is the updates from clients, which provide the update to the discriminator after training on the target data. For the generated data, it can be easily obtained from the corresponding generator. Therefore, the advance of GAN could be utilized in the federated learning. In addition, since GANs could generate conditioned samples if supervised by the condition in training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, we could train mGAN-AI conditoned on the updates from victim, thus it could generate victim-conditioned samples, i.e., client-level privacy.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Specifically, the discriminator of mGAN-AI is designed to achieve three tasks: 1) real-fake discrimination like standard GAN, 2) categorization on input samples, which performs like the shared model, further increasing the quality of generated samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and 3) identification on the input sample to distinguish the victim from other clients. The novel discrimination on identity is the key to violate
user-level privacy.

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the identification task, data from the victim and other clients are required to train the discriminator, while the sever cannot directly access those data. Aono et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> recovered the client data based on the update from the client, which is accessible for a malicious server in the federated learning.
However, it is only suitable for a simple setting, where the shared model has to be a fully connected network, and the update is required to be obtained by training on a single sample.
Obviously, these limitations significantly impede the adaptation of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> to those widely adopted learning methods, e.g., convolution neural network, batch learning, etc.
Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, we estimate the representative data of each client from its update sent to the server. The representatives of a client are defined to be synthesized samples that achieve the same update as the real samples after trained on the shared model.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section evaluates the effectiveness of passive mGAN-AI by comparing the reconstructed samples with the real samples of the victim. Instead of evenly splitting the training data to the clients, we simulate biased data distribution on clients according to the setting of federated learning. In addition, opposite to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> that assumed each client consists of a single class, we achieve more flexible condition that each client could own samples from multiple classes.

The distinguishable property of the victim is assigned to be wearing glasses. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-B1 Evaluation on the MNIST dataset ‣ VI-B Client-level Privacy Attack by mGAN-AI ‣ VI Experimental Evaluation ‣ Beyond Inferring Class Representatives: User-Level Privacy Leakage From Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the first row shows the private data of the victim, i.e., two faces wearing glasses. The second row are faces from other clients that do not wear glasses. Note that the first two faces in the second row are the same person as in the first row. Therefore, successfully attack to the victim should be reconstruction of the first two person wearing glasses. The 3rd and 4th rows are corresponding representatives. The last row are reconstructed samples, where the first two samples are identical to the victim while the rest are significantly distorted. This demonstrates that mGAN-AI could only clearly reconstruct the private data of the victim, i.e., mGAN-AI specifically attacks the victim.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Note that mGAN-AI does not violate the differential privacy (DP), which aims to prevent the recovery of specific samples used during the training. In other words, DP tries to make the adversary fail to tell whether a given sample belongs to the training set.
However, without inferring the membership of a given sample, it can still generate samples distinguishable from real samples as demonstrated in Figs. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Client-level Privacy Attack by mGAN-AI ‣ VI Experimental Evaluation ‣ Beyond Inferring Class Representatives: User-Level Privacy Leakage From Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-B1 Evaluation on the MNIST dataset ‣ VI-B Client-level Privacy Attack by mGAN-AI ‣ VI Experimental Evaluation ‣ Beyond Inferring Class Representatives: User-Level Privacy Leakage From Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, which obviously leads severe privacy violation.
Besides, convergence of the shared model requires a relatively loose privacy budget when applying DP in the federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which means the magnitude of the perturbation should be carefully controlled to ensure high-utility updates used for training the multi-task GAN in mGAN-AI.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing the results from the proposed mGAN-AI with MI and GAN-based attack, mGAN-AI generates samples with much higher quality and more identical to the real samples.
The results of MI attack is significantly blurry, consistent with the results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
The failure is mainly caused by simply maximizing the model output w.r.t. a target label, which would lead to uninterpretable samples when dealing with complicated neural networks.
sharing the spirit with another threat for deep learning — adversarial examples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
The results of GAN-based attack do not converge at all because it heavily relies on the introduced “adversarial influence” which would be averaged (become trivial) before adding to the shared model. The results of GAN-based attack are consistent with those in its original work, where unrecognizable images were generated without the adversarial influence.
Comparing the passive and active attack of mGAN-AI, the active attack performs better but it would slightly degrade the learned model in the federated learning. By contrast, the passive learning does not effect the learning model, which will be demonstrated later.</p>

The GAN-based attack significantly reduces the accuracy and presents drastic oscillation (non convergence) because it introduces adversarial influence. The passive mGAN-AI achieves the highest accuracy because it does not affect the training process of federated learning. The active mGAN-AI gets a bit lower but stable accuracy. With this cost, however, it achieves better reconstruction quality as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI-B2 Evaluation on the AT&amp;T dataset ‣ VI-B Client-level Privacy Attack by mGAN-AI ‣ VI Experimental Evaluation ‣ Beyond Inferring Class Representatives: User-Level Privacy Leakage From Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigated the privacy risk of federated learning, which is considered as a privacy-preserving learning framework working in a decentralized manner. Against federated learning, we proposed a generic and practical reconstruction attack named mGAN-AI, which enables a malicious server to not only reconstruct the actual training samples, but also target a specific client and compromise the client-level privacy. The proposed attack does not affect the standard training process, showing obvious advantages over the current attack mechanisms.
The extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the mGAN-AI can reconstruct samples that resemble the victim’s training samples, outperforming the state-of-the-art attacking algorithms.</p>
