<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are often used to transmit physical sensor data over digital wireless channels. Traditional Physical Layer Security (PLS)-based cryptography approaches rely on accurate channel estimation and information exchange for key generation, which irrevocably ties key quality with digital channel estimation quality. Recently, we proposed a new concept called Graph Layer Security (GLS), where digital keys are derived from physical sensor readings. The sensor readings between legitimate users are correlated through a common background infrastructure environment (e.g., a common water distribution network or electric grid). The challenge for GLS has been how to achieve distributed key generation. This paper presents a Federated multi-agent Deep reinforcement learning-assisted Distributed Key generation scheme (FD2K), which fully exploits the common features of physical dynamics to establish secret key between legitimate users. We present for the first time initial experimental results of GLS with federated learning, achieving considerable security performance in terms of key agreement rate (KAR), and key randomness.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, with the advances in wireless sensor networks and embedded systems, our life has been revolutionized by a variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, which provide ubiquitous connections among environments. More and more IoT-based applications have been implemented in healthcare and smart cities. For instance, in a complex networked system, such as an oil, gas, or water network, the maintenance team can have 24/7 monitoring of the conditions of the network by deploying multiple embedded IoT devices. However, as the data obtained by IoT devices are normally related to privacy, sensitivity, and confidentially, which are easily captured by adversaries or eavesdroppers, the research challenge lies in how to secure the data through wireless communication.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional method for securing the data is to apply a complexity-based cryptography scheme, which, however, does not have an information theory-based secrecy guarantee, and is therefore vulnerable to post-quantum threat. In order to achieve the theoretical secure capacity, physical layer security (PLS)-based key generation has been viewed as an efficient technology, which extracts common randomness of features to generate secret keys between two legitimate users, i.e, Alice and Bob <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Specifically, Alice and Bob keep measuring their common channel through a key generation protocol including channel probing, quantization, information reconciliation, and privacy amplification, and finally generate symmetric cipher keys at both ends <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Current PLS-based key generation schemes leverage to extract common features from channel state information (CSI). In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the authors were the first to propose a sufficient key generation algorithm in WIFI system, in which both the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the peak of channel impulse response (CIR) were considered. In order to break the barrier that RSSI and the peak of CIR can only provide limited information from wireless channels, it was found that there are more CSI about multiple sub-carriers of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, Zhang <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a key generation scheme that exploits the subcarriers’ channel response over time in OFDM system. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, Xi <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a key generation scheme named KEEP, which utilized a validation recombination mechanism to generate keys from CSI measurements of all subcarriers. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors conducted extensive experiments about the different configurations of long-range communication technology (LoRA) on the key generation performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, Zhang <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> concluded that the movement of the LoRA devices has a significant influence on the received power in a large-scale environment and they proposed a differential value-based key generation scheme. Other key generation schemes have been extensively studied for various wireless scenarios, e.g., the fifth-generation (5G), and wireless body area network (WBAN). In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the features of the virtual angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) were utilized to generate keys in the millimetre wave multiple-input and multiple-output (mmWave MIMO) system and the authors analyzed the performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, Zhang <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> found that the interpulse intervals (IPIs) between two adjacent peaks of heartbeat signals can be a good random source for key generation in WBAN and they proposed a key establishment protocol, which utilized the electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to secure communications.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although PLS-based key generation schemes have been widely applied in a variety of wireless networks, it is still not suitable for IoT-embedded networks. On the one hand, PLS assumes that the wireless channel between the legitimates must contain enough characteristics in terms of reciprocity, dynamics, and uniqueness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. That is to say, in order to establish reliable keys, IoT devices should acquire reasonable signal processing capability and rely on the high communication signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). On the other hand, most IoT devices are normally buried underground, which means that reasonable SNR can not be obtained. Therefore, PLS is not suitable when channel estimation is not reliable.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to solve the issue that PLS requires a high SNR for channel estimation, Graph Layer Security (GLS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> has become a promising approach. Generally, in networked systems, the embedded physical dynamics can be described by a common continuity equation, such as Navier Stokes for flow, and Nonlinear Schrodinger for optical transmission. The IoT devices deployed in networked systems can commonly detect the physical dynamics with high accuracy and they do not suffer from high SNR for channel estimation. However, the proposed scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> utilized the overall physical dynamics among the networked system to generate the global keys for information encryption/decryption between legitimate users. The global keys could be easily captured by adversaries and the overall key generation system is not fully distributed. Motivated by the previous work in GLS and in order to make the generated keys robust against attacks from adversaries, we summarize the main contributions of this paper as follows:</p>

More precisely, during the process of key generation, Alice and Bob have to fully exploit the common features of physical signals between each other without any information exchange. Besides, they have to generate well-qualified keys that satisfy the performance metrics, which we will introduce in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Experimental Results ‣ Securing IoT Communication using Physical Sensor Data - Graph Layer Security with Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The training process of the traditional DRL-based system is implemented in a simulator that requires the established training data based on previously obtained physical signals, which have to be collected remotely and could be known by Eve. In order to protect the security and privacy of the local physical signals of Alice and Bob in the training process, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is applied to eliminate the process of data collection. More precisely, in the framework of the proposed scheme, a controller is deployed in the proposed scheme. It first initializes a global actor network and downloads it to Alice and Bob. Then, Alice and Bob take local training for certain epochs and upload their local actor network models to the controller, which takes aggregation and obtains a new actor network. Both Alice and Bob repeat the process of downloading, local training, and uploading. The controller repeats aggregation until the network is adequately trained. Therefore, it is concluded that during the training process, the training data of agents are stored locally and only the network model is uploaded/downloaded, which can help to protect privacy and security.</p>

<p id="S4.p5.2" class="ltx_p">After the training stage, the networks of Alice and Bob are saved for evaluation. Note that our proposed FD2K scheme is based on the framework of centralized training and decentralized execution, both Alice and Bob enable to generate keys with their locally observed physical signals without any information/key exchange. As a result, the process of key generation can be fully distributed. We evaluate the performance of keys generated by FD2K in terms of KAR in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Securing IoT Communication using Physical Sensor Data - Graph Layer Security with Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Considering the situation that most IoT devices embedded in networked systems in the real world are normally buried underground, the physical signals are extremely difficult to be obtained by the adversary, namely Eve, or easily to be found if inserting extra IoT devices. Additionally, in PLS, most of the digital attacks are based on the assumption that the IoT devices detached in the networked system are viewed as legitimate users, which means Eve can not insert any IoT device or can not obtain the perfect physical signals. Therefore, we consider a practical case that the actor network of Bob is attacked and known by Eve during the federated learning but it can not perfectly obtain the physical signals of Bob. Eve can capture the wireless signals from Alice and generate keys with different physical signals for information decryption. From Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Securing IoT Communication using Physical Sensor Data - Graph Layer Security with Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we can conclude that the average KAR of keys generated between Alice and Bob consistently outperforms the average KAR between Alice and Eve.

The proposed key generation scheme is based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach, which enables legitimate users to generate keys in a distributed manner. Besides, the federated learning technique is applied to protect the privacy and security of local training data. Experimental results conclude that the proposed key generation scheme has efficient superiority for capturing common features between different physical signals and the generated keys have considerable performance improvement in terms of KAR, randomness, etc.</p>
