<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we tackle the network delays in the Internet of Things (IoT) for an enhanced QoS through a stable and optimized federated fog computing infrastructure. Network delays contribute to a decline in the Quality-of-Service (QoS) for IoT applications and may even disrupt time-critical functions. Our paper addresses the challenge of establishing fog federations, which are designed to enhance QoS. However, instabilities within these federations can lead to the withdrawal of providers, thereby diminishing federation profitability and expected QoS. Additionally, the techniques used to form federations could potentially pose data leakage risks to end-users whose data is involved in the process. In response, we propose a stable and comprehensive federated fog architecture that considers federated network profiling of the environment to enhance the QoS for IoT applications. This paper introduces a decentralized evolutionary game theoretic algorithm built on top of a Genetic Algorithm mechanism that addresses the fog federation formation issue. Furthermore, we present a decentralized federated learning algorithm that predicts the QoS between fog servers without the need to expose users’ location to external entities. Such a predictor module enhances the decision-making process when allocating resources during the federation formation phases without exposing the data privacy of the users/servers. Notably, our approach demonstrates superior stability and improved QoS when compared to other benchmark approaches.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the early history of computing, we have been observing computers getting smaller, more powerful, and more widespread. This was clearly observed in the 1980s with the advent of personal computers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. More recently, this revolution of computing has been taking place via the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT applications are countless. Starting from smart thermostats to smart cameras, and driverless vehicles, IoT applications have been essential in our lives.
IoT devices tend to offload their processing data to more powerful external devices such as cloud servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, in some particular cases, cloud providers may not be able to meet the increasing quality of service (QoS) demands of IoT applications. Mainly because some IoT applications require really low latency such as autonomous vehicles, and smart traffic control. To fix this issue, a new technology was conceived, fog computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fog computing is an extension of cloud computing that brings cloud servers to the edge of the network. Having servers at the network edge next to the IoT application has a twofold benefit. On one hand, it reduces the network’s latency as fog computing enables real-time data processing and analytics at the network edge, reducing the need for extensive data transmission to centralized cloud servers. On the other hand, it equips the fog servers with location awareness, an essential feature for many IoT applications such as smart vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, building fog servers demands high deployment costs. Therefore, the fog federation concept has arisen to solve this problem efficiently. Fog federation refers to fog providers sharing their unallocated resources instead of keeping them idle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Fog federations increase the QoS of the fog servers: offloading tasks to another server might be beneficial during the shortage of resources. Also, offloading could provide lower transmission delay if we choose the target server to be closer to the clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fog federation formation problem is classified as NP-hard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, indicating that there is no known algorithm that can solve the problem in polynomial time. Therefore, researchers typically employ heuristics, meta-heuristics, or approximation algorithms to find near-optimal solutions to the problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The formation algorithm is required to have low complexity, low accuracy and respect the privacy of the user data, while the formed federations must be stable (i.e., providers would not want to deviate from their federations) and profitable to the providers. Developing efficient and effective algorithms for fog federation formation is an ongoing area of research, with the aim of striking a balance between computational complexity, solution accuracy, privacy preservation, and provider profitability. Most literature techniques tended to concentrate on one or two requirements while disregarding the remaining ones. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> did not have a QoS prediction model to improve the accuracy, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> had a broker which may violate the privacy of the users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of this work is to devise a (1) stable, (2) profitable, (3) computationally efficient, (4) data privacy-aware, and (5) fully decentralized approach for the formation of the fog federations, without the need for a third party to handle the management. We first address the problem of privacy of collecting users’ request metadata by advising federated learning mechanisms that can predict the QoS of the computing infrastructure without compromising the data privacy of its users. A key aspect of our framework is the client selection process that involves identifying specific entities to participate in devising the infrastructure QoS predictor. We explore the strategies employed to address the heterogeneity of clients (fog providers) and their data distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Moreover, we present our approach to client selection, which leverages a weighted algorithm, ensuring that clients with varying dataset sizes contribute optimally to the global model. Our research sheds light on the critical role of client selection in enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and privacy preservation of federated learning systems, providing insights into the advancements made in this evolving field. Subsequently, we trained and assessed this model against other benchmark models, and then employed it as a QoS predictor for our approach.
Moreover, we investigate an efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) model to assign federations and compose the infrastructure efficiently. Afterward, boosted by the GA, we employ an evolutionary game theoretical approach to help stabilize the formed set of federations and maintain an adequate service for the users. As a result, the derived architecture using this approach exhibits exceptional metrics in terms of QoS and stability when compared to other methods.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we mainly focus on presenting the work done on federated computing. First, we start with federated cloud computing as it provides a great perspective on fog computing. Then, we shift to federated fog computing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the paper discussed several cloud federation formation techniques. The main cloud federation formation mechanism (CFFM) discussed in this paper was designed as a game where agents dynamically cooperate to form the targeted federations. That CFFM was demonstrated to be stable, i.e., the agents won’t have any incentive to leave their algorithm-recommended federations. One potential concern with the CFFM is data privacy, which may arise from the requirement that agents share information to form targeted federations. Specifically, the agents may need to share data on their resource availability, utilization, and performance to help the CFFM algorithm recommend suitable federations. Sharing such information may raise concerns related to data privacy, as agents may not be comfortable sharing sensitive information with others. Additionally, sharing such data could potentially expose agents to security risks, such as hacking or data breaches, if the data is not adequately secured or if agents do not trust each other. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors built upon Mashayekhy et al work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and came up with two new techniques for forming cloud federations. The first technique was the genetic algorithm, a meta-heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. The genetic algorithm outperformed the algorithm mentioned in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, it was converging slowly to the solution. Then, the authors proposed a fast converging algorithm that outperformed the aforementioned algorithms. That algorithm was utilizing evolutionary game theoretic techniques that improved the profit up to 10% compared to Mashayekhy’s method. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the authors defined fog computing and compared it with the traditional cloud computing models. The main characteristics of fog computing are its edge location, location awareness, and low latency. The paper went on to describe one of the prominent technologies that require fog computing such as connected vehicles, smart traffic lights, and smart grids. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> focused on video streaming services. They devised a solution for reducing their latency metric. Through federating neighboring fog nodes, the authors leveraged data caching and fetching on the edge of the network. Their solution reduced the latency of the data when being fetched on demand. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors adopted the evolutionary game theoretic cloud federation formation technique introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> to fog federations. However, the model lacks a way to predict the QoS dynamically, a requirement for forming the federations. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, the authors employed a hedonic game theoretical approach technique to ameliorate the providers’ payoff. Their formation technique measures the resources and profit of the fog providers when making clustering decisions in order to provide a better service quality. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a resource management framework that establishes a federated fog acting as a consortium to share free resources among the consortium members. The authors also devised a model based on pricing for sharing the computing resources while, at the same time, limiting the offloading mechanism among units to other members. Most of the problems addressed above were tackled in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The authors, Shamseddine et al, devised a machine learning algorithm to predict the QoS accurately ahead of federation formation. However, the privacy issue of the broker having access to the data of the clients remained. This shortcoming could be fixed by using a decentralized learning model instead. Additionally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> used the genetic algorithm as a federation formation technique which is not as efficient as was proven in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. To address this, we are also exploring this by extending Shamseddine et al model to use evolutionary game theoretic models for federation formation while utilizing a federated learning approach to address the networking data privacy shortcomings.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In IoT context, there are many fog providers each with their own fog servers. Each fog server has its own geographic location and capacity. Due to resource constraints, Application Content Providers are unable to deploy all necessary services on their devices. Consequently, such services are hosted on available fog nodes. Each application content provider is contracted with one or more fog providers to offer resources for its users. Sometimes a fog provider is over-occupied and can’t meet the Application Content Providers’ needs. In this case, it will lead to the dissatisfaction of the user, which can further lead to monetary losses. Federation solves this by delegating the tasks to a fog server of a different provider.

that each server has to send its users’ data to the broker, which violates the
privacy of the users. This is where federated learning takes place by securing

Instability would imply
the existence of an incentive for a fog provider to deviate from its current
strategy, and that would harm the QoS of the federation and thus, its reputation. This could affect the main characteristic of the fog federations, the low latency factor, thus, leading to the dissociation of the whole federation.
There are many definitions of stability, the most stringent of them would be
the strong Nash equilibrium. In this kind of equilibrium, no coalition, fixing the actions of its complements, can profitably deviate from the prescribed strategy profile. However, this kind of equilibrium would be too computationally hard to
obtain and its existence is not always guaranteed as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
That limits us to a less strict notion of equilibrium, the strict pure Nash equilibrium, defined as the following:</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to run the federation formation algorithm, we need to provide it with accurate real-time data about the performance and the load of the network between the requesting user and each of the fog servers. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the authors focused on using a machine-learning model that predicts the QoS values of the requests to the fog nodes. Each fog node sends data to the broker that preprocesses it and then uses it to train the model. However, this model poses a great privacy threat where the broker knows confidential details about the agents’ requests. This is why in this paper we are transitioning to a privacy-preserving and decentralized learning scheme, i.e., federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a decentralized learning scheme that preserves the privacy of the users. Each provider has a local training data set which is never uploaded to the broker.
Instead, each client computes an update to the current global model maintained by the broker, and only this update is communicated. The final model is then obtained on a client by aggregating all the local models into a global model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>
Below is the explanation of the steps required to advance a federated learning model to predict the QoS run-time and throughput for the new requests to the fog servers. We explore the most suitable and practical learning models that yield high levels of accuracy. The following points outline the essential steps required to execute the federated learning architecture:</p>

It’s performed with the goal of increasing the accuracy and efficiency of a machine-learning model. Data preprocessing also involves the process of selecting the features of the input data. Additionally, data preprocessing may include handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing or scaling the data to ensure uniformity and improve the performance of the machine learning model. Furthermore, it may involve encoding categorical variables, such as converting text or categorical data into numerical representations, to make them compatible with the algorithms used for training the model</p>

Cross-validation is a more robust evaluation model that divides the data into multiple subsets, performing multiple train-test splits. It is more reliable in estimating the model’s performance.</p>

The federated learning client selection process decides which client devices are chosen in each training round. The reasons why this phase is needed is due to the fact that federated learning cannot afford to utilize all of the clients in the same training round.

Other factors to consider that might hinder the client selection process, including but not limited to, heterogeneous data distributions and system capabilities. In addition, not all clients will be simultaneously available for federated training. Furthermore, including too many clients for the training process may result in inefficient efforts and less-than-optimal performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

This section will demonstrate the goals of client selection in federated learning as follows. First and foremost, diversity means ensuring that a diverse set of clients participate to prevent model bias and representativeness issues. This involves considering different types of devices, data distributions, and network conditions. Second, privacy is a main aim that implies protecting the privacy of individual clients by selecting a subset of clients whose data contributions do not risk exposing sensitive information. The selection algorithm also ought to be efficient, selecting clients that can contribute the most useful updates to the global model. Finally, the client selection process needs to be accurate, which means prioritizing clients with high-quality data or models to improve the accuracy of the global model.</p>

Many strategies were enumerated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. We will mention some basic ones here. One simple strategy is assigning weights to clients based on their data quality, model performance, or other relevant factors. Clients with higher weights are more likely to be selected, improving the convergence and accuracy of the global model. Proximity-based selection is another valid strategy. It works by selecting clients based on their geographical proximity or network latency to the central server. This strategy can help reduce communication overhead and improve training efficiency.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The Genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic commonly used for optimization and search problems. Genetic algorithms were invented by John Holland in the 1960s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, Holland’s original goal was to use it to study the phenomenon of adaptation and evolution, when he published his book, Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems. Then, Goldberg extended it for optimization and search problems in the 1989s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Since then, Genetic algorithms have been applied in lots of fields such as image and signal Processing, computational finance, bioinformatics, and Robotics. The Genetic algorithm is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency. They are mainly used to solve resource-demanding problems such as the NP-hard ones. Consideration of the specific problem and appropriate adjustments are essential for the successful application of GAs. The genetic algorithm is founded on three main pillars: (1) the encoding and the search space, (2) the fitness function, and (3) the evolution operators <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

The Genetic algorithm was created to stimulate nature, thus, most of its terminology uses biological terms. We call this encoding a chromosome after the biological carriers of genetic information. Encoding is a crucial step in genetic algorithms as it determines how the information of a solution is structured and represented. Typically, encoding is problem-specific and will defer from one problem to the other. There are multiple encoding techniques that are in use for the Genetic algorithm, including but not limited to binary encoding, integer encoding, permutation encoding, and tree-based encoding. For our problem, we are trying to figure out which federation each fog server should be allocated.

<div id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The genetic algorithm contains three types of operators: selection, crossover, and mutation. The first operator is selection. Before proceeding to the next generation, the Genetic algorithm selects which chromosomes will be carried over. This process micks evolutionary pressure as by selecting individuals with better fitness, the genetic algorithm promotes the propagation of traits and characteristics that contribute to improved solutions over time. There are many methods of selection. Elitist selection only selects the top-ranked chromosomes. Roulette Wheel Selection, which is used in our implementation, selects a chromosome with a probability based on its relative fitness. Roulette Wheel Selection is better than the former method as it encourages exploration and diversity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The crossover operation begins after the selection operation is performed. It involves combining genetic material from parent individuals to create offspring with potentially improved characteristics. The crossover operation involves randomly picking a crossover point in the parent chromosomes, and then exchanging the genetic material of the parents at this point to produce two offspring. For example, to crossover ‘1 2 3 4 5’with ‘a b c d e’, a random crossover point is first picked, let’s say index 2. Then, the exchanging process happens to produce ‘1 2 c d e’with ‘a b 3 4 5’.
The crossover operation in genetic algorithms facilitates the exploration of the solution space by combining genetic information from parent individuals to create diverse offspring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The mutation operation serves as another mechanism to introduce diversity into the population and is the most straightforward of the three genetic operators. By randomly selecting an element of the chromosome, it alters that element with a certain probability. While crossover primarily focuses on combining genetic material from parent individuals, mutation introduces small, random changes to individual chromosomes, allowing for exploration beyond the existing solutions</p>

Lines 1-4, represent the initialization process. The algorithm evaluates every chromosome and then sorts them by fitness. Lines 5-18, represent a loop that represents the evolution of the population. It only terminates when the end condition is met. In the first step of the loop (lines 6-10), a bunch of genetic operators are being applied to the population. First, crossover operation between every two chromosomes, followed by a mutation. The resultant chromosomes are added to the gene pool. Upon termination, the algorithm will return the first element which is the fittest.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Game theory is the study of mathematical models involving strategic rational agents. Game theory provides a framework to understand and predict behaviors in various fields, such as economics, politics, biology, and computer science, and has practical applications in areas like negotiation, pricing, and resource allocation.
Evolutionary game theory is the extension of game theory using the Darwinian theory of evolution. In evolutionary game theoretic models, agents do not have to be rational about their decisions. Instead, one of the main features of evolutionary game theory is the focus on the dynamics of the strategy changes, and which strategy can dominate other strategies. Individuals with more fit strategies will be replicated more frequently than others.
This approach allows for the exploration of how different strategies can emerge and evolve over time through processes such as selection, mutation, and replication. By studying the relation between strategy dynamics and evolutionary forces, evolutionary game theory provides insights into the long-term outcomes and stability of strategic interactions in complex systems.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we will evaluate our adaptive federation formation model in terms of (1) stability, (2) quality of service, and (3) federations payoff. We compare our approach to two baselines: (1) the genetic approach presented in Shamseddine et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>,
and (2) a greedy approach.
The greedy algorithm is almost identical to our algorithm except that it’s executed simultaneously by each player without coordination. At every round, every player moves to the federation that provides the local maximum, hence it’s greedy. We will be using the same federated learning model as a quality of service predictor for the three approaches. For the Genetic and the Greedy approaches, we assign the initial population using K-means and let each approach update the population using its own method.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fog federation has gained recent interest since it helps improve the QoS of fog providers, and thus eliminates the bottleneck in developing IoT applications.
However, fog federations may suffer from instabilities that might incentivize some providers to leave the federation. That would harm the QoS of the federation. In this paper, we proposed a decentralized architecture for forming stable fog federations.
It consists of a dynamic QoS prediction model that has twofold benefits over the previous model. On one hand, it eliminates the costs associated with the broker. On the other hand, it eliminates data privacy threats by utilizing federated learning models.
Utilizing the prediction model, an initial fog federation formation scheme is devised using a Genetic Algorithm, followed by an evolutionary game theoretical model to stabilize the federations.
The numerical findings demonstrate that the formation process reaches a state of stability, leading to enhanced payoff and quality of service in terms of response time and throughput.</p>
