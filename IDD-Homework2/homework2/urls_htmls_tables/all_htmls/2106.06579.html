<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">As neural networks get widespread adoption in resource-constrained embedded devices, there is a growing need for low-power neural systems. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging to be an energy-efficient alternative to the traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which are known to be computationally intensive.
From an application perspective, as federated learning involves multiple energy-constrained devices, there is a huge scope to leverage energy efficiency provided by SNNs.
Despite its importance,
there has been little attention on training SNNs on a large-scale distributed system like federated learning.
In this paper, we bring SNNs to a more realistic federated learning scenario.
Specifically, we propose a federated learning framework for decentralized and privacy preserving training of SNNs.
To validate the proposed federated learning framework, we experimentally evaluate the advantages of SNNs on various aspects of federated learning with CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks.
We observe that SNNs outperform ANNs in terms of overall accuracy by over <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="15\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">15</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">15</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">15\%</annotation></semantics></math> when the data is distributed across a large number of clients in the federation while providing up to <math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="5.3\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="id2.2.m2.1b"><mn id="id2.2.m2.1.1">5.3</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="id2.2.m2.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">5.3\times</annotation></semantics></math> energy efficiency.
In addition to efficiency, we also analyze the sensitivity of the proposed federated SNN framework to data distribution among the clients, stragglers, and gradient noise and perform a comprehensive comparison with ANNs.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Neuromorphic learning is being explored as a resilient low-power alternative to conventional Deep Learning in the perspective of both algorithm and hardware <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. With the release of neuromorphic chips like IBM TrueNorth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and Intel Loihi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, we are not very far from neuromorphic processors becoming a part of everyday life. A class of Neuromorphic Learning algorithms called Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained widespread attention for their ability to achieve comparable performance to that of deep neural networks at considerably less computation cost and extreme energy efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. SNNs, analogous to the electrical activity in the human brain, utilize the discrete spike mechanism with Integrate-and-Fire (IF) or Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron units to transmit information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering their energy efficiency, SNNs have a huge potential to be deployed in applications on embedded devices. However, these models need to be continuously trained and updated according to the new data collected at these devices. Conventional cloud-based machine learning collects data from the devices, transfers it to a central location, and trains the model offline. However, owing to increasing privacy concerns, it is unwise to transfer data out of the device. Modern collaborative on-device learning methods such as Federated Learning offers a solution for this.
Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is used for private and data-secure distributed learning among mobile devices (or clients) and a cloud server. This enables model training without the transfer of data from the client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to the cloud. This is particularly helpful when the data is sensitive and privacy is of paramount importance. Federated learning has been deployed in day-to-day applications such as Google Gboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and is likely to be deployed in multiple practical applications in healthcare, retail, finance, wireless communication, etc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. It provides the advantage of continuously learning and updating the model as and when the new data is available which is more practical compared to offline training. It can also enable user personalization as we train models locally on user data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

(c) Federated Learning — In this case, the training is performed at the client, and model gradients are communicated to the base station which aggregates the gradients and updates the global model, and broadcasts it back to all the clients. Each of these processes is iterative and models at the clients are periodically updated. </span></figcaption>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A major distinguishing factor of federated learning over traditional distributed training lies in the properties of the data distribution in the clients. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> summarizes the difference between conventional machine learning, distributed learning and federated learning. In conventional machine learning, the data is collected into a single location and a model is trained offline on a single machine. However, as modern systems deal with enormous amount of data it is not always feasible to train a model on a single machine. Hence, distributed learning aims to accelerate the training process by parallelizing the training across multiple workers by distributing the training dataset. Here, since all the data is available at one location (i.e. cloud server), it can be Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) among the workers. This results in each worker having nearly the same amount of data and equal distribution of all the classes resulting in a stable learning method and faster convergence. On the other hand, in federated learning, the clients are not allowed to share their local data to the cloud server. The clients can only share their local model updates with the server. Furthermore, owing to the heterogeneity in the client devices, the IID assumption is not valid in the case of federated learning. Handling the non-IID data among the clients is one of the key aspects of federated learning that is widely studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. This problem is further amplified as the number of clients increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another important factor to consider while designing a federated learning system is the impact of stragglers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. As the devices are not controlled by the central server and typically the updates happen over an unreliable network, it is not guaranteed that all the clients will send their updates to the server within an acceptable time limit. Hence, the server might end up with fewer updates than expected. Further, recent studies have shown that some of the data can be recovered from the model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. To counter this data leakage, there is a body of work involving differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> which obfuscates the gradients of the model with noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Hence, the training algorithm for federated learning must be resilient to noise in the model updates communicated to the server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A majority of existing SNN literature examines SNNs only through the lens of energy efficiency and is limited to standard machine learning settings where the entire dataset is available in one place. There has been little attention on utilizing SNNs in more practical systems beyond classic image recognition task. A potential reason for this limitation is the lack of robust training algorithms for SNNs.
Traditionally, the non-linear thresholding functionality in LIF or IF spiking neurons is known to prohibit the conventional backpropagation-based training methods for SNNs. Hence, the training of SNNs was limited to unsupervised learning methods like Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and conversion of fully trained ANN to SNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. However, recent findings illustrate methods to reliably train SNNs using an approximate gradient backpropagation method. This method unrolls the network and performs a Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) similar to that of recurrent neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In addition to this, a recent work uses batch normalization in the time dimension—Batch Normalization Through Time (BNTT) in order to achieve high performing SNNs by training from scratch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Such gradient-based training methods enable SNNs to be used in distributed training methods such as federated Learning. Further, recent studies suggest that SNNs are robust to adversarial attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. As security is a major concern in federated learning applications, we believe SNNs can be a viable alternative to ANNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to previous works which are limited to extracting computation and energy efficiency with the spiking model, we look at SNNs from the perspective of robust distributed training.
We propose a method to train SNNs in a federated learning paradigm and conduct a series of structured experiments to study the robustness of SNNs trained in a federated manner with respect to the different aspects of federated learning.
Previously, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> propose an on-device training method for SNNs in a federated setting using a probabilistic SNN model. In contrast to their work, we use a mainstream gradient-based approach instead of a probabilistic model to make the training faster and more scalable. Moreover, since the reported experiments in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> were performed on the MNIST-DVS dataset, it may not be straightforward to extend it to mainstream computer vision problems. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the first to train SNNs with federated learning on complex image datasets and perform a comprehensive analysis of robustness, performance, and energy efficiency.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.7" class="ltx_p">A spiking neuron is modeled by an Integrate-and-Fire (IF) mechanism — each neuron keeps track of its membrane potential by accumulating the incoming spikes scaled by their corresponding synaptic weights and generates a spike when its membrane potential reaches a certain threshold. In the Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) variant, the membrane potential also leaks at a constant rate.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.8" class="ltx_p">The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> propose a method to leverage batch normalization in temporal dimension to improve the training performance of SNNs. With this method, it is possible to train low latency and high-performing SNNs from scratch without the need for a fully trained ANN model. This is achieved by associating a local learning parameter to each time-step and thereby expanding the batch norm layer through time.
During the forward propagation, the BNTT layer is applied after each convolutional/linear layer as:</p>

We show the contrast between IID and non-IID and between SNN and ANN. While the training curve is smoother for ANN on IID data, SNN has a relatively smoother curve in the case of non-IID data distribution. Particularly, in the course of ANN training with non-IID data, we occasionally observe a sharp decline in the performance. While the overall training is not fully smooth, the training of SNNs is comparatively robust to sharp changes. </span></figcaption>

The validation set is held out and is used to evaluate all the models. We use the validation accuracy on this held-out dataset as the performance metric throughout our experiments. All the reported validation accuracy values are calculated by averaging across three repetitions of the experiment.
We use a batch size of 32 across all the experiments. We train locally on each client for 5 epochs which is termed as <span id="S4.p2.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local epochs</span> and train the global model for 100 <span id="S4.p2.6.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">rounds</span>.

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We use VGG9 as the base model for our experiments. VGG9 consists of 7 convolutional layers and two fully connected layers with pooling layers to reduce the dimension. Traditionally max pooling is used in ANN literature and average pooling is more common in the SNN literature. To make the comparison simple, we use average pooling for both ANN and SNN. We use SGD optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001 and weight decay of 5e-4 for ANN while we use SGD with an initial learning rate of 0.1 and momentum of 0.95 for SNN. The learning rate is reduced by a factor of 5 after 40, 60, and 80 epochs. Since the training mechanisms are different, naturally, one set of hyperparameters will not be optimal for both ANN and SNN.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we plot the training curve for one instance of federated learning with 10 total clients and 2 clients participating in each round to investigate the training progress. We observe a smoother curve with IID data distribution compared to non-IID in both ANN and SNN. This is expected since the non-IID case has a high variance in the data among the devices. In the case of ANN with non-IID data, we observe that the accuracy drops sharply at some of the rounds (round 38 and 52 in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>b) implying that ANNs are sensitive to every model update whereas in SNN training there is no such sharp performance drops.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since real-world federated systems involve a huge number of devices, a federated learning model must be scalable with the number of devices. To evaluate the scalability of our method, we perform a series of experiments steadily increasing the number of total and participating clients in the federated learning process (Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Scalability ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-A Scalability ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>). We report the performance on several combinations of clients for both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-A Scalability ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> and provide plots in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Scalability ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> to visualize the trend.
While the ANN achieves superior accuracy in the baseline case of 1/1 (N/P) configuration, the accuracy drops sharply as the number of clients increases. On the other hand, the performance degradation is not as steep in the case of SNN. SNNs surpass the performance of ANNs when the total number of clients is increased to 100. This phenomenon is more pronounced in the case of CIFAR100 (shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Scalability ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>b) where the ANN model accuracy goes below 20% for 100/10 clients which is practically unusable. Therefore, as the number of clients increase, we observe that SNNs outperform the corresponding ANNs.</p>

Especially in the case of non-IID, it is desirable to have a model that can generalize well with less number of clients participating in each round. To study the impact of number of participating clients, we use the case with CIFAR10 trained with 100 clients and progressively decrease the number of participating clients from 100 to 1.

In case of IID, since all the clients contain similar data distribution, both ANNs and SNNs are preserving the performance as the number participating clients reduce. This implies that SNNs are robust in generalizing the model using updates from only a fraction of the total clients.</p>

For the IID case, in both SNN and ANN, we observe a slight impact of noise as the performance is gradually decreasing. On the contrary, there is no visible impact on the performance in the case of non-IID resulting in a nearly flat line. This can be explained by the fact that gradient updates from non-IID is inherently diverse. Hence, adding noise to the gradients has minimal effect on the performance implying that differential privacy techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> can be seamlessly applied to SNNs to make the system more secure.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We perform a comprehensive study on the feasibility of training spiking neural networks in a federated learning paradigm. We show how to train SNNs from scratch in a federated setting using the BNTT method. We experimentally evaluate the performance and estimated energy of the VGG9 SNN trained on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets and compare them with corresponding ANNs. We study different facets of federated learning such as data distribution across the clients, stragglers, and gradient noise to find potential strengths and weaknesses of SNNs. We find that SNNs outperform ANNs when the data is distributed across a large number of clients and are equally robust to ANNs in handling non-IID data, stragglers, and noise in the gradients. We conclude that SNNs are a viable alternative to ANNs in large-scale federated learning with embedded devices, owing to their energy efficiency and superior performance when the number of clients is scaled up.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the series of experiments we identify that while SNNs are equally robust to ANNs in all the facets of federated learning, the key advantage of SNNs is the ability to preserve the accuracy at scale. In our experiments, as the size of the dataset is fixed, dividing it among a large number of clients results in each client having fewer samples. Naturally, the updates from these clients will overfit to their local dataset. Hence, it is difficult to aggregate these local models into a robust global model.
Therefore, we can infer that federated training of SNNs with our method is more sample efficient i.e. the local SNN model in each client can generalize well with fewer data samples as compared to ANNs. Consequently, the aggregated global model is preserving the performance.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that since SNNs contain more gradient updates due to the unrolling of the network in the time dimension, the gradients updates are more likely to become smoother providing a form of regularization to the local model. This regularization occurs intrinsically due to temporal processing in SNNs is contributing to their robustness in handling variability in the gradients from a large number of clients.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to having promising results with SNNs, this study opens up many questions to explore in future work. For example, developing a theoretical basis to explain the observation of a relatively lower decline in performance in SNNs compared to ANNs as the number of clients is increased. This would help in manifesting SNNs as a more scalable alternative to ANNs in federated learning.
Federated learning involves many more engineering intricacies such as handling delays/failures in the client updates, the communication cost of models and gradients to and from the clients, and the policy of selecting the clients in each round. SNNs can provide unique advantages in each of these directions. Exploring temporal datasets beyond static vision for federated learning with SNNs is also a potential direction to explore.</p>
