<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Asynchronous federated learning aims to solve the straggler problem in heterogeneous environments, i.e., clients have small computational capacities that could cause aggregation delay. The principle of asynchronous federated learning is to allow the server to aggregate the model once it receives an update from any client rather than waiting for updates from multiple clients or waiting a specified amount of time in the synchronous mode. Due to the asynchronous setting, the stale model problem could occur, where the slow clients could utilize an outdated local model for their local data training. Consequently, when these locally trained models are uploaded to the server, they may impede the convergence of the global training.
Therefore, effective model aggregation strategies play a significant role in updating the global model. Besides, client scheduling is also critical when heterogeneous clients with diversified computing capacities are participating in the federated learning process. This work first investigates the impact of the convergence of asynchronous federated learning mode when adopting the aggregation coefficient in synchronous mode. The effective aggregation solutions that can achieve the same convergence result as in the synchronous mode are then proposed, followed by an improved aggregation method with client scheduling. The simulation results in various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges with a similar level of accuracy as the classical synchronous federated learning algorithm but effectively accelerates the learning process, especially in its early stage.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The distributed learning nature of Federated Learning (FL) can effectively address the privacy concerns associated with machine learning by sharing only the refined model instead of exposing raw data to other devices. Under the coordination of the central server, clients collaboratively train a global model through an iterative process. The training process is organized into discrete rounds, with each round building upon the training results obtained in the previous round. This classical synchronous federated learning (SFL) could suffer straggler issues caused by slow clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid advancement of pervasive intelligence, a wide range of heterogeneous devices can now serve as clients for FL. These devices include desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, Raspberry Pis, and more. By collecting data from nearby sensors, these devices can conduct local training and learning. However, computing resource-constraint devices, such as Raspberry Pis, may experience delays and become stragglers when processing substantial volumes of data. To address these straggler issues, various strategies have been proposed to be integrated within SFL frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, a method was proposed where a small subset of clients is sampled in each round, eliminating the need to wait for updates from all clients. However, it does not fully address the straggler issue, as slower clients can still be selected within the subset.
A predefined synchronous window was suggested to aggregate as many client updates as possible in each round in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, slow clients may not get the opportunity to upload their updates during the entire learning process. Furthermore, it does not ensure the convergence of the model.
An adaptive local computation scheme in resource-constrained edge computing systems was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, where fast clients can execute more local iterations than slow clients. Nevertheless, the global model still needs to wait for all clients to complete their local computations before getting the updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another strategy to tackle the straggler problem is called asynchronous federated learning (AFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, in which the process of local model uploading at clients and global aggregation at the server are separated. Thus aggregation of the global model is executed without the need to wait for receiving all the client models.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> presented an online AFL algorithm with data being non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID).
The server initiates the aggregation process upon receiving the update from a single client. The newly aggregated model is then distributed to the clients deemed ‘ready’. However, there is a lack of definition of ‘ready’ clients, nor does it outline a methodology on how to select.
Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed to decouple scheduling and aggregation but did not define the criteria for client selections in the scheduling. A Euclidean distance-based adaptive federated aggregation algorithm was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> to solve the stale model problem in AFL.
The staleness is measured using the distance between the current global model and the stale global model. This evaluation process requires the server to store all the global models, starting from the initial training phase up to the current iteration, leading to significant consumption of storage resources on the server.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> considered AFL over wireless networks where a global model is broadcast to all the clients in each global iteration. Despite the various works mentioned above, few of them have offered a comprehensive architectural outline of AFL. Moreover, no comparative analysis between SFL and AFL has been provided.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, a new AFL framework with client scheduling and model aggregation is developed. The proposed scheduling mechanism considers both computational capabilities and fairness. The model aggregation component is designed to address the staleness problem inherent in AFL. Besides, a detailed AFL architecture and a comparative analysis between AFL and SFL are given.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the SFL framework, the learning process unfolds iteratively between the server and clients. Each iteration consists of four fundamental steps. Firstly (S1), the server disseminates the current global model to all clients. Secondly (S2), clients utilize the global model as the initial point and employ an optimization method such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to derive a new local model. Following this, in step 3 (S3), the updated local model is uploaded to the server. Finally (S4), the server awaits either a fixed amount of time or model updates from a predetermined number of clients before performing aggregation. This process can be observed in Figure 1 (left). Notably, in SFL, a “wait” stage is present to allow all clients to upload their respective local models, thereby preventing the server from aggregating prematurely.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Under asynchronous settings, the server is not mandated to wait. Instead, the server initiates the aggregation process as soon as a model is received from a client. This approach also enables faster clients to proceed with local learning without waiting for slower clients. In SFL, a round is uniformly observed by both the server and all clients. However, faster clients perform more rounds in AFL than their slower counterparts. To keep track of the learning process, we will utilize the global aggregation number.

There is extensive idle time in SFL while the learning continues in AFL. Based on the aforementioned details, we can infer that AFL is expected to learn faster than SFL as more computations are executed within the same time frame. To gauge the extent of AFL’s speed, we analyze both modes in specific scenarios. First, a homogeneous scenario is considered, where each client has identical computational capabilities.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.9" class="ltx_p">To fully leverage the advantages offered by AFL, we propose a client scheduling approach that incorporates a model aggregation scheme. This scheduling method takes into account both the computational capabilities of clients and the principle of fairness. When a client completes its local computation, it requests a time slot for uploading its updated local model. Subsequently, upon receiving the most recent aggregated global model, the client proceeds with learning for the next iteration. In situations where two clients complete their local computations simultaneously and apply for an uploading time slot, priority is given to the client with the older model.

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The client scheduling approach described above is effective when there is relatively little variation in the computation capabilities among clients. However, there are two extreme scenarios that need to be considered. The first scenario arises when there are a few extremely fast clients, potentially operating at significantly accelerated speeds (e.g., <math id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math> times faster). The second scenario occurs when there are some excessively slow clients. To ensure that all clients have a fair opportunity to contribute to the global model, we employ a policy similar to the one outlined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. This policy allows clients with greater computation capabilities to perform more local iterations, thereby dedicating more time to the learning process. Conversely, clients with lower computation capabilities perform fewer local iterations, enabling them to spend less time on the task. By adopting this approach, we can maintain a balanced contribution from all clients, regardless of their varying computation speeds.</p>

In the case of SFL, all clients participate in the learning process during each round.

Two public image datasets, i.e., MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, are used for simulation. MNIST consists of handwritten digit images, while Fashion-MNIST comprises images of Zalando’s articles. Both datasets feature 10 classes, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Under the IID scenario, the images are randomly allocated equally among the clients. However, in the non-IID scenario, each client is assigned two classes, resulting in approximately 600 training images per client. For the machine learning tasks, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with two convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. Given the complexity of the Fashion-MNIST images, the hidden layer sizes in the CNN for Fashion-MNIST are larger. The activation function for the last layer is the log softmax function, while ReLU is used in other layers.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we introduced a client scheduling and model aggregation scheme for asynchronous federated learning. Our approach took into account both the computation capability and fairness of the clients in the scheduling process, while also addressing the issues of individual client contribution and model staleness in model aggregation. The results demonstrated that the proposed scheme can accelerate the federated learning process during the initial stages, while still achieving comparable performance to the synchronous algorithm.</p>
