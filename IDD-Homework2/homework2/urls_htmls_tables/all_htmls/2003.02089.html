<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique that enables many edge devices to train a machine learning model collaboratively in wireless networks.
By exploiting the superposition nature of wireless waveforms, over-the-air computation (AirComp) can accelerate model aggregation and hence facilitate communication-efficient FL.
Due to channel fading, power control is crucial in AirComp.
Prior works assume that the signals to be aggregated from each device, i.e., local gradients have identical statistics.
In FL, however, gradient statistics vary over both training iterations and feature dimensions, and are unknown in advance.
This paper studies the power control problem for over-the-air FL by taking gradient statistics into account.
The goal is to minimize the aggregation error by optimizing the transmit power at each device subject to peak power constraints. We obtain the optimal policy in closed form when gradient statistics are given.
Notably, we show that the optimal transmit power is continuous and monotonically decreases with the squared multivariate coefficient of variation (SMCV) of gradient vectors.
We then propose a method to estimate gradient statistics with negligible communication cost.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed gradient-statistics-aware power control achieves higher test accuracy than the existing schemes for a wide range of scenarios.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices has revolutionized people’s daily lives.
Due to the growing computation and sensing capabilities of these devices, a wealth of data has been generated each day.
This has promoted a wide range of artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as image recognition and natural language processing.
Traditional machine learning procedures, including both training and inference, are carried out through cloud computing on a centralized data center that has full access to the entire data set.
Wireless edge devices are thus required to upload their collected raw data to the center, which can be very costly in terms of energy and bandwidth consumption, and unfavorable due to response delay and privacy concerns.
It is thus increasingly desired to let edge devices engage in the learning process by keeping the raw data locally and performing training/inference either collaboratively or individually.
This emerging technology is known as Edge Machine Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> or Edge Intelligence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is a new edge learning framework that enables many edge devices to collaboratively train a machine learning model without exchanging datasets under the coordination of an edge server in wireless networks.
Compared with traditional learning at a centralized data center, FL offers several distinct advantages, such as preserving privacy, reducing network congestion, and leveraging distributed on-device computation.
In FL, each edge device downloads a shared model from the edge server, computes an update to the current model by learning from its local dataset, then sends this update to the edge server.
Therein, the updates are averaged to improve the shared model.
FL has recently attracted significant attention from both academia and industry, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The main bottleneck in FL is the communication cost since a large number of participating edge devices send their updates to the edge server at each round of the model training.
Existing methods to obtain communication-efficient FL can be mainly divided into three categories: model parameter compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, gradient sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and infrequent local update <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, the communication cost of FL is still proportional to the number of edge devices, and thus inefficient in large-scale environment.
Recently, a fast model aggregation approach is proposed for synchronous FL by applying the over-the-air computation (AirComp) principle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
This is accomplished by exploiting the waveform superposition nature of the wireless medium to compute the desired function of the distributed local gradients (i.e., the weighted average function) by concurrent transmission.
Such AirComp-based FL, referred to as <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">over-the-air FL</em> in this work, can dramatically save the uplink communication bandwidth.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the channel fading, device selection and power control are crucial to achieve a reliable and high-performance over-the-air FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the authors jointly optimize the transmit power at edge devices and the receive scaling factor (known as denoising factor) at the edge server for minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the aggregated signal.
It is shown that the optimal transmit power in static channels exhibits a threshold-based structure.
Namely, each device applies channel-inversion power control if its quality indicator exceeds the optimal threshold, and applies full power transmission otherwise.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, however, is purely for AirComp-based signal aggregation (not in the context of learning), where the signal on each device is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (IID) with zero mean and unit variance.
For AirComp-based gradient aggregation in FL, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> introduces a truncation-based approach for excluding the edge devices with deep fading channels to strike a good balance between learning performance and aggregation error.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposes a joint device selection and receiver beamforming design method to find the maximum number of selected devices with MSE requirements to improve the learning performance.
As in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, it is assumed in both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> that the signal (i.e., the local gradient) to be aggregated from each device is IID, and normalized with zero mean and unit variance.
By exploiting the sparsity pattern in gradient vectors, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> projects the gradient estimate in each device into a low-dimensional vector and transmits only the important gradient entries while accumulating the error from previous iterations.
Therein, a channel-inversion like power control scheme, similar to those in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> is designed so that the gradient vectors sent from the selected devices are aligned at the edge server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Note that all the exiting works on power control for over-the-air FL have overlooked the following statistical characteristics of gradients:
<em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the gradient distribution over training iterations is not necessarily identical; and even in the same iteration, the distribution of each entry of the gradient vector can be non-identical.</em>
A general observation is that the gradient distribution changes over iterations and is different in each feature dimension.
In addition, if the gradient distribution is unknown for each device, normalizing the gradient to a distribution with zero mean and unit variance is infeasible.
As such, due to the neglect of the above characteristics of gradient distribution, the existing power control methods for over-the-air FL may not perform efficiently in practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above issue, in this paper, we study the optimal power control problem for over-the-air FL in fading channels by taking gradient statistics into account.
Our goal is to minimize the MSE of the aggregated model at each iteration, and hence improve the accuracy of FL, by jointly optimizing the transmit power at each device and the denoising factor at the edge server given the first-order and second-order statistics of gradients.
The main contributions of this work are outlined below:</p>

We first derive the MSE expression of gradient aggregation at each iteration of the model training when the first-order and second-order statistics of the gradient vectors are known.
We then formulate a joint optimization problem of transmit power at edge devices and denoising factor at the edge server for MSE minimization subject to individual peak power constraints at edge devices.
By decomposing this non-convex problem into subproblems defined on different subregions, we obtain the optimal power control strategy in closed form.
Unlike the existing threshold-based power control for normalized signal in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, our optimal transmit power depends not only on the channel quality and noise power, but also heavily on the gradient statistics.
In particular, we find that the relative dispersion of the gradient values, i.e., the squared multivariate coefficient of variation (SMCV) of the gradient vectors, plays a key role in the optimal transmit power control.
Specifically, we prove that the optimal transmit power of each device is a continuous and monotonically decreasing function of the gradient SMCV.</p>

In the special case where the gradient SMCV approaches infinity, which could happen when the model training converges and/or the dataset is highly non-IID, we show that there is an optimal threshold for the device aggregation capability, below which the device transmits with full power and above which it transmits at the power to equalize the weight of its gradient for aggregation to one.
In the other special case where the gradient SMCV approaches zero, which could happen when the model training just begins, we show that the optimal power control is to let all the devices transmit with their peak powers.</p>

Experimental results demonstrate that the over-the-air FL with the proposed adaptive power control obtains higher model accuracy than the considered existing power control methods (full power transmission and threshold-based power control for normalized signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>).
In particular, while the full power transmission performs poorly in high signal-noise ratio (SNR) region and non-IID data distribution and the threshold-based power control for normalized signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> performs poorly in low SNR region and IID data distribution, the proposed power control can perform very well over a wide range of scenarios by exploiting the gradient statistics.</p>

It is difficult to capture the tradeoff between the two errors by directly using their respective weights, namely, the gradient variance and gradient mean.
To tackle this issue, we introduce two alternative parameters of gradient statistics in this subsection.</p>

In particular, the threshold-based power control can only perform efficiently when the model training converges and the dataset is highly non-IID, the full power transmission can only perform efficiently when the model training just begins and the dataset is IID.
Compared with these two schemes, our proposed power control policy is always optimal.
These findings shall be validated via experimental results in Section V.</span></p>

The algorithm has three steps.
First, each device locally takes one step of SGD on the current model using its local dataset (line 5).
After that each device calculates the norm of its local gradient and uploads it to the edge server with conventional digital transmission (line 6 and line 7).
Second, the edge server estimates parameters <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha(t)" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml">α</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2"><times id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.2.2">𝛼</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\alpha(t)</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta(t)" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml">β</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">t</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2"><times id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.2.2">𝛽</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">\beta(t)</annotation></semantics></math> based on the received gradient norm at time block <math id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.3.m3.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> and historical aggregated gradient (line 9 and line 16).

It is observed that the performance gap to the scheme with known gradient statistics is very small, which indicates the proposed methods for estimating gradient statistics are effective.
It is also observed that the model accuracy of the proposed power control scheme is better than threshold-based power control and full power transmission.

Threshold-based power control suffers significant accuracy loss in the IID partition or at the beginning of training.
This is because in this case, the gradient SMCV is small and thus the MSE is dominated by the composite misalignment error.
As a result, threshold-based power control that considers the individual misalignment error only is much inferior.
Besides, full power transmission suffers significant accuracy loss in the non-IID partition or at the end of training.
This is because the gradient SMCV is large and therefore the full power transmission scheme fails to minimize the individual misalignment error that dominates the MSE in this case.</p>

It is observed that the overall performance of the proposed scheme is still better than two baseline approaches at low SNR region.
In specific, full power transmission performs better than threshold-based power control scheme.
This is mainly because when the noise variance is large, full power transmission can strongly suppress noise error that dominates the MSE.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work studied the power control optimization problem for the over-the-air federated learning over fading channels by
taking the gradient statistics into account.
The optimal power control policy is derived in closed form when the first- and second-order gradient statistics are known.
It is shown that the optimal transmit power on each device decreases with gradient SMCV and increases with noise variance.
In the special cases where <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">β</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝛽</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">\beta</annotation></semantics></math> approaches infinity and zero, the optimal transmit power reduces to threshold-based power control and full power transmission, respectively.
We propose an adaptive power control algorithm that dynamically adjusts the transmit power in each iteration based on the estimation results.
Experimental results show that our proposed adaptive power control scheme outperforms the existing schemes.
In the future work, we can further exploit the gradient statistics for joint power control and beamforming when each edge device has multiple antennas.</p>
