<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Software quality is a core aspect that should be considered when engineering and developing software systems. Indeed, low software quality, known in the literature as "Code smell," is one factor that leads to technical debt and thus increases maintainability costs. Managing technical debts through code smell detection improves the quality and longevity of the software systems’ life cycles. This paper proposes a Federated Learning Code Smell Detection (FedCSD) approach that allows organizations to train federated ML models while preserving their data privacy collaboratively. These assertions have been supported by three experiments that have significantly leveraged three manually validated datasets to detect and examine different code smell scenarios. In experiment 1, which was concerned with a centralized training experiment, dataset two achieved the lowest accuracy (92.30%) with fewer smells, while datasets one and three achieved the highest accuracy with a slight difference (98.90% and 99.5%, respectively). This was followed by experiment 2, which was concerned with cross-evaluation, where each ML model was trained using one dataset, which was then evaluated over the other two datasets. Results from this experiment show a significant drop in the model’s accuracy (lowest accuracy: 63.80%) where fewer smells exist in the training dataset, which has a noticeable reflection (technical debt) on the model’s performance. Finally, the last and third experiments evaluate our approach by splitting the dataset into 10 companies. The ML model was trained on the company’s site, then all model-updated weights were transferred to the server. Ultimately, an accuracy of 98.34% was achieved by the global model that has been trained using 10 companies for 100 training rounds. The results reveal a slight difference in the global model’s accuracy compared to the highest accuracy of the centralized model, which can be ignored in favor of the global model’s comprehensive knowledge, lower training cost, preservation of data privacy, and avoidance of the technical debt problem.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Software quality assurance is a major aspect that occupies the minds of software engineers and the software engineering community at large. Consequently, there is a continuous need to maintain the quality of the software, given that it is a determinant in many aspects during and after development. Specifically, software quality assurance determines and detects the software pieces that suffer from low quality in design or programming. These pieces are known as "Code Smells" <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fowler and Beck (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>)</cite>. The existence of code smells does not produce errors during compilation or execution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pérez (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>, they also negatively influence the software quality factors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">AbuHassan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Alkharabsheh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Brown et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, the availability of the code smells increases the time and effort required to maintain the software. This extra time and effort is known as technical debt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cunningham (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>, which can be indicated by the presence of code smells. Several terms and concepts have been used to denote code smells, such as antipatterns, disharmonies, design flaws, design defects, code anomalies, design smells, etc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alkharabsheh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Code smells can be identified in various software components, from instructions to subsystems, and can influence different levels of software granularity, such as methods, classes, and the whole system. Code smell detection is an efficient way to decrease maintenance costs and support the efforts of software developers to improve the quality of software.
Due to the increasing size and complexity of the developed software systems, more automated approaches are needed to improve the activity of code smell detection. At present, several approaches concentrate on code smell detection, such as metric/rule-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Choinzon and Ueda (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>); Fourati et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>); Marinescu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>); Moha and Guéhéneuc (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>); Munro (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>); Shatnawi (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>); Tahvildar and Kontogiannis (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite> and machine learning-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alkharabsheh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>); Hassaine et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>); Khomh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>); Kreimer (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>); Maneerat and Muenchaisri (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>); Pecorelli et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Most of these approaches have been evaluated empirically, and they obtained a high precision in smell detection. However, there is a set of challenges that constrain their endorsement in industry, such as the ratio of false negative and false positive in their findings and the low degree of agreement between them. Nevertheless, some of the proposed approaches have been developed as detection tools (commercial or open source) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Borland (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>); Copeland (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>); Marinescu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>); Moha and Guéhéneuc (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>); Tsantalis et al. (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the existing shortcoming and challenges in these approaches, several studies, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Al-Shaaby et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Azeem et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Fontana et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>); Kreimer (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>); Maneerat and Muenchaisri (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>, have shown that machine learning-based approaches played a central role in code smell detection and can be more exploited in this direction. Consequently, it is possible to make a quantum leap in improving the detection of the right code smells with high accuracy. Machine Learning (ML) uses mathematical algorithms to award systems the ability to learn without the need of programming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alzubi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional ML training process (centralized training) demands a considerable amount of collected and aggregated data, typically in a centralized place such as a data centre, cloud, or server machines. This centralized data aggregation is imperative for constructing an accurate model with quality that adapts to dynamic data, aiming to provide recommendations, decisions, and solutions for specific tasks. However, the considerable expense associated with transferring data to a central hub presents a significant hurdle. Moreover, this data often contains sensitive and private information belonging to the data owner, leading to concerns regarding both data privacy and security. Such matters counter GDPR policies and pose challenges across various sectors, including healthcare, industry, politics, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As a concrete example, let’s examine the software industry within the context of our research. In this industry, every company holds a significant stake in understanding the source code and design quality employed by their competitors. Aspects such as performance, maintainability, and reusability are of utmost importance. These companies are keen on leveraging this invaluable data to elevate the quality of their software products. They aim to identify and rectify anomalies and deficiencies in their codebase while refining coding practices and policies to produce top-notch enterprise software. However, it’s crucial to note that no company within this competitive landscape will release their private data, including their source code and design details. Instead, they are in pursuit of techniques that allow them to extract valuable insights and knowledge from other companies’ data in a secure and non-invasive manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this regard, Federated Learning (FL) emerges as an efficient solution that maintains data privacy and security. FL differs from centralized ML in migrating the ML model to the data’s source for training, typically on the edge side. Unlike centralized ML, FL enables all edge-node models to contribute their knowledge without exposing the raw data (source code or design in our case). By employing FL, software enterprises that are hesitant to share their data can internally train their ML models and then transfer the learned model to a designated entity responsible for maintaining software quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>); Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The main contribution of this paper is to propose a Federated Learning Code Smell Detection (FedCSD), which to the best of our knowledge is the first approach that exploits FL for code smell detection. Specifically, we show how FedCSD can be applied in settings where multiple software development companies collaborate to improve the quality of their software development projects without the need to share their code. Further, we discuss how FedCSD can improve the traditional code-review activity within software development teams. Finally, we present intensive experiments that show the advantages of applying FedCSD to detect code smells in comparison to traditional centralized ML approaches.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Code smell detection is an essential activity for enhancing the quality of software. Previous studies have shown great interest in code smell detection, evident by the huge number of proposed approaches and techniques, such as manual inspection, which is considered error prone and time consuming, and automatic detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alkharabsheh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Rasool and Arshad (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. Efficient techniques have been used, such as ML, mining algorithms, dynamic or static analysis, meta modeling, genetic algorithms, and visualization. The proposed approaches and techniques define and translate code smells into detection rules. These rules consist of a group of metrics generated from analyzing software source code based on the code smells definition.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several code smell detection tools have been developed either as standalone or integrated, commercial or open-source, and they support different programming languages and detect various types of code smells. Examples of these tools include iPlasma <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Marinescu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>, DECOR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Moha and Guéhéneuc (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>,PMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Copeland (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>, Borland Together <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Borland (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>, and JDeodorant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tsantalis et al. (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>. However, they have limitations that reduces using them effectively in industry. Namely, they have low degree of agreement, lack the capability to analyze software systems implemented in more than one programming language, and do not detect a wide set of code smells.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One of the code smells that detection tools focus on the most is Large Class <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fowler and Beck (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>)</cite>, also referred to as God Class <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lanza and Marinescu (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>, and the Blob <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Brown et al.

According to Fowler <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fowler and Beck (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>)</cite>, a large Class is a class that tries to do too many tasks, making it very large regarding the total number of lines of code, number of methods, number of variables, and dependencies with other classes. Therefore, the possibility of duplicated code will be increased. Moreover, this class has high complexity as well as low cohesion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Brown et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>); Lanza and Marinescu (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>. In the literature, several studies have focused on detecting the Large Class code smell <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alkharabsheh (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Alkharabsheh et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>); Yamashita et al. (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. In their systematic mapping study,
the authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alkharabsheh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> analyzed close to 400 articles related to code smells and found that Large Class negatively affects different software quality attributes, the most important of which is maintainability. Based on the above and since Large Class is one of the code smells most frequently detected in software systems, we decided to focus on it in this work.</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite> and traditional ML approaches are centralized approaches. In general, they require data to be collected and aggregated offline on one site, where the models are trained and deployed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>); Lim et al. (<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. These approaches are not suitable for code smell detection because training and deploying ML models in central nodes requires companies to disclose the source code of their projects. Similarly, distributed learning approaches require the code to be released to the distributed servers. Thus, such approaches do not address the companies’ privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cai and He (<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Pang et al.

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the aforementioned limitations, Google proposed FL, an emerging paradigm that enables users or organizations to jointly train an ML model without releasing their private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bonawitz et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>. Specifically, in FL settings, companies can train a global ML model to detect code smells collaboratively by aggregating the local trained models’ updated parameters (gradients, weights) and reporting them to the FL server, where the global model will be constructed, then propagating the global model to all the involved companies or contributors. Therefore, by exploiting FL, the companies do not need to share their source code or data thereby preserving their privacy and they just share their models’ learned knowledge that collaboratively builds a comprehensive global model to detect code smells.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Scenarios surrounding traditional ML allude that centralization plays a major role in holding training data and executing the learning algorithm. In real world situations, the legal restrictions and privacy laws prohibit sharing even well-trained models across diverse participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Truex et al. (<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Data being the driving force behind the running of many companies, it is worth noting that a majority of ML models are owned by tech companies; based on how these companies manage the data and code behind the running of operations, this raises pertinent questions of centralization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Doku et al. (<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Centralization in this context provides an avenue for a single point of failure and increases the threat levels and potential attack surfaces with possibilities of zero day vulnerabilities. To accommodate data owners’ constant need for a secure and collaborative execution of data, an FL environment provides guarantees and assurances from a privacy and security perspective. However, the literature pinpoints other diverse scenarios that emphasizes privacy, for example during model-training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alawadi et al.

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy Concerns in Code Smell Detection are important in the software development landscape. This importance is mainly seen when we consider the inherent sensitivity of both code and data ownership. In the conventional paradigm of centralized code smell detection, where code repositories are extensively analyzed, a critical issue emerges where potential exposure of sensitive or proprietary information is imminent. These repositories often hold the confidential data that form the backbone of an organization’s software projects. When sharing such code repositories or data with external parties, traditional methods inadvertently raise significant privacy concerns. In this study we assess these capabilities from the perspective of intentional or unintentional data leakage which could compromise the trained model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kjamilji et al.

code injection on original code and adversarial attacks are prevalent in many cases when preparing, training, or deploying learning models. The common form of security related attacks involves adversarial manipulation, tampering with code and training data, during the testing phases, indiscriminate attacks where an adversary gives wrong decisions in order to damage the classifiers, integrity attacks, and availability attacks focused on degrading the usability of the FL system and the code deployed by increasing the positive rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Goodfellow et al.

To the best of our knowledge, FedCSD is the first proposed approach that evolves the traditional code review life cycle by integrating FL to detect code smells during the development. Consequently, our approach enables addressing code smells proactively, unlike the majority of existing approaches, which manage the technical debt issues re-actively. The approach exploits traditional architectures of FL and is mainly based on the FEDn framework.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The reducer acts as a server in the server-client paradigm, which has several responsibilities, including the following: (1) monitoring the model training; (2) controlling the communications flow among all the federation components; (3) initiating the seed model with a random weight and then distributing it among the connected combiners; (4) propagating the computing package where the model training and validation instructions are descried to combiners then from combiners to the connected clients; (5) starting the training (i.e., communication rounds); and (6) aggregating all the updated parameters of the combiners’ local–global models then averaging them using FedAvg algorithm (see Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="In 3.1 FedCSD in Action ‣ 3 FedCSD Approach ‣ FedCSD: A Federated Learning Based Approach for Code-Smell Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) to construct the final global model. Meanwhile, the combiner represents the intermediate layer responsible for the following: (1) linking the reducer with different client nodes to decrease the reducer’s computation load and the network communication workload; (2) distributing the received model from the reducer across all corresponding clients; and (3) combining all local models’ updated gradients provided by the connected clients using the FedAvg algorithm to build the local–global model.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, the clients layer represents the companies’ local servers (edge nodes), where the data is placed and the local model training rounds are performed. Each client in the federation will receive from the combiner both the ML model and the computing package, which is considered the guideline for the client to train the model.

The algorithm returns the model’s updated parameters that will reported backward to the upper layer. Each client should be connected to a combiner, but multiple clients can be connected to the same combiner, as can be seen in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 FedCSD in Action ‣ 3 FedCSD Approach ‣ FedCSD: A Federated Learning Based Approach for Code-Smell Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Code review is one of the main activities that reduces maintenance costs and technical debt. Detecting and addressing code smells early prevents them from becoming more complex problems in the future, especially when the software systems are large-scale. Also, developers can improve their knowledge and learning experience by discussing and determining refactoring opportunities suggested by ML models. Also, thanks to FL, our approach enables the generation ML models that are trained on a variety of software systems from multiple companies without the need to share the code bases of the different projects.</p>

The cycle starts when engineers or developers request to check their individual code for smells before creating code review requests to their team leads or other experienced team members (step 1). Then, the ML model detects smells in the developers’ individual code and provides them with feedback (step 2). Accordingly, the developers update their individual code and then create code review requests (e.g., using Bitbucket) (step 3). After that, the team members responsible for reviewing the different code submitted for review receive feedback from the ML model about smells detected in the entire code being reviewed (steps 4 and 5). Accordingly, the code reviewers provide feedback, possibly to multiple developers, to adjust the code to improve its quality (step 6). This cycle continues until all the comments on the code are addressed and no smells are detected. Consequently, the code submitted for review is approved and merged to the suitable branch (e.g., a release branch on GitHub) (step 7).</p>

The set of software systems used in each dataset were open-source, written in Java, came from different domains and size categories, and were available in different repositories, such as Github and SourceForge. Moreover, they are well-known and widely used in the code smell detection context. Concerning (our) dataset (i.e., the 3<sup id="S4.SS1.p1.4.3" class="ltx_sup">rd</sup> one), we followed concrete criteria to collect the software systems from the repositories, including the number of downloads, availability in several versions, and the history of software systems’ maintenance.

As a result, the number of false positives God Classes was reduced in all datasets from <math id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2,696" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">2</mn><mo id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml">696</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2b"><list id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">2</cn><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2.2">696</cn></list></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.2.m2.2c">2,696</annotation></semantics></math> to <math id="S4.SS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="721" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">721</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1">721</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.3.m3.1c">721</annotation></semantics></math>, which represents a <math id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="26\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">26</mn><mo id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2">26</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.4.m4.1c">26\%</annotation></semantics></math> reduction.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, we used the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect the God Class code smell over the datasets mentioned earlier. The model was implemented using the public TensorFlow framework implementation from Keras <span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow</span></span></span>. However, the model architecture is composed of one LSTM input layer with 16 dimensions, four dense layers, and one output layer to distinguish between God Class and Not God Class. For instance, we fixed the model hyper- parameters per communication round to have a 0.001 initial learning rate with the Adam optimizer. Then, we fixed the batch size to 32. Finally, we set the maximum number of epochs to 1. This model has been used in both centralized and collaborative training experiments (FedCSD).</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, we simulated new changes in the coding behavior that would be caused by a new worker who recently joined the team or by updates in the company policies that have significant impacts on both their internal culture and their products. Therefore, we evaluated the ML model that was trained using one dataset over the other two datasets (cross-evaluation). Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 4.4 Experiment 2: ML model cross-evaluation ‣ 4 Results and Discussion ‣ FedCSD: A Federated Learning Based Approach for Code-Smell Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> reports the accuracy obtained by the model trained in one dataset and validated over the other two datasets. We noticed that when the model used either <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Pecorelli et al.</span> or <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Khalid et al.</span> one for training and one for testing, the model obtained the highest accuracy because both datasets shared the same behavior and distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, when the model was trained or tested over the <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fontana et al.</span> dataset, the opposite happened, where the model achieved the lowest accuracy compared with other results. However, we would like to highlight that the <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fontana et al.</span> dataset covers different types of smells and does not have the same distribution as other datasets. Therefore, a significant gap can obviously be noticed between the lowest accuracy (63.80%) and the highest accuracy (97.00%).</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, this experiment clearly shows the significant impact of the new coding behavior or culture on the smell detection model. Moreover, Comparing the results obtained by experiment 1 and experiment 2, in some cases we noticed an ML model drift concept, while in other cases the model performance was slightly affected. To tackle this problem, we propose our FedCSD approach, where a global model is collaboratively constructed using the contribution of different companies, which can convey a company’s culture changes and their team’s coding behavior.</p>

In this experiment, we simulated 10 companies to participate in the federation by splitting both the <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Pecorelli et al.</span> and <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Khalid et al.</span> datasets into chunks that represent five and four companies, respectively, and keeping the <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fontana et al.</span> dataset to represent one company. This allowed us to maintain all clients’ heterogeneity and replicate a real scenario. Consequently, the experiment showed the power of federated learning and mitigated the challenges we faced in the previous experiments. Further, we found that this will reduce the computation cost by leveraging the edge nodes (companies) resources to train the model, preserve each company’s data privacy, construct a global model that has a comprehensive knowledge of code smells accumulated from all clients, and reduce the opportunity of having technical debt if new smells appear.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several works are focused on using standard ML based on different techniques for code smell detection. In one study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kreimer (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>, ML and object-oriented metrics extracted from analyzing software systems were combined into an approach to automatically detect design flaws. The proposed approach was evaluated on two open-source systems. The findings showed that the decision tree effectively detects Large Class and Long Method smells. Another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Maneerat and Muenchaisri (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> utilized ML to predict seven types of design smells (Message Chains, Middle Man, Switch Statement, Long Parameter List, Long Method, Feature Envy, and Lazy Class). The dataset was constructed from a group of 27 metrics gathered from software systems, including design smells.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Khomh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>, the Bayesian Detection Expert (BDTEX) approach was proposed to detect well-known antipatterns named Functional Decomposition, Spaghetti Code, and the Blob. The approach was evaluated on two systems, and the results were compared with the DECOR approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Moha et al. (<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>. Further, one study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Maiga et al. (<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> presented a novel approach that uses the support vector machine and object-oriented metrics to detect Swiss Army Knife, the Blob, Spaghetti Code, and Functional Decomposition antipatterns by analyzing three software systems. The results were compared with the DETEX approach. In another work by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Peiris and Hill (<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, five ML techniques were used based on software metrics to detect different antipatterns. The presented approach was named NiPAD. The study was conducted using one application, and the result showed that the best behavior was obtained by the SVMlinear technique for identifying the One-lane Bridge antipattern. A more recent research study by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fontana et al. (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> used 16 ML classifiers to detect Data Class, God Class, Long Method, and Feature Envy code smells. The chosen smells were automatically detected using five tools. The study evaluated 74 software systems, and the results of detection were validated manually by experts in the domain. The findings showed that most of the techniques have a high degree of accuracy. Moreover, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pecorelli et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, the performance of metric-based and machine learning-based approaches was empirically compared in terms of code smell detection. The dataset was constructed from 13 software systems and 17 metrics to detect 11 code smells. The results showed that metric-based approaches achieve a slightly better performance. Nonetheless, there is a need to conduct more studies on both approaches in order to enhance the precision and efficiency of code smell detection.
Recently, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alkharabsheh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite> conducted a large-scale study that investigated the usefulness of ML techniques for effective design smell detection. The work focused on determining the influence of data balancing on the accuracy of ML techniques during design smell detection. A set of 28 classifiers was used to detect God Class design smell in a dataset of 24 software systems that include 12,587 classes, and the detection results were validated manually by experts. After replicating the experiments on two more datasets, the findings showed there is no significant influence of data balancing on the accuracy of learning classifiers during design smell detection. Moreover, machine learning approaches are efficient in God Class detection. Detecting SQL code smells using code analysis seems like an interesting future work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ragab et al. (<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">All the above studies concluded that standard machine learning-based approaches have a promising and efficient role in the code smell detection context. However, it has some limitations concerning the obtained model. The generated model has been trained on a dataset stored in a centralized place and gathered from different open source software projects located in well-known repositories. In this case, due to the data privacy risks concerning data leaks or misuse and the reluctance of companies to share their complete project data on these repositories, there might be a lack of information about the project context that should be taken into account when training the model, such as architectural patterns, domain-specific requirements, and coding conventions. Therefore, the model may not completely comprehend the intricacies of each software project’s coding practises. Consequentially, the model’s accuracy will be affected. In this work, to overcome the limitations of previous works, we exploited the advantages of federated learning for code smell detection. On the one hand, our approach involves the significant project-specific context information that can be lacking or cannot be shared between companies when training the model, resulting in a more accurate and generalizable code smell detection model. On the other hand, our approach preserves better the data privacy and security of software projects, as companies do not need to share their code repositories.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The experiments that have been conducted in this study have shown the importance of applying FL to preserve privacy during the training of an ML model, owing to the complexity that is involved during software design. While code smells are seen as perennial issues that affect the quality of software, machine learning specifically the federated aspect is touted as a game changer in code smell detection not only with a higher degree of accuracy but also with precision in preserving essential attributes of the code and data. Accordingly, this study offers an optimal approach aimed at addressing the endemic and perennial privacy issues prevalent during ML training phase. We are cognizant of the fact that the extracted knowledge during data training plays a significant role; hence, securely distributing and showing the extracted knowledge from the FL approach presents an ideal way of solving the challenges of traditional centralized machine learning approaches.
In addition, the FedCSD uses data from a closed software, which has considerable advantages in code smell detection. Notably, this approach can be applied in a multitude organizations that will collaboratively be able to not only train ML models but also detect code smells, preserve the privacy of their data, and at the same time expose the relevant security-related risks during the training of ML models.

<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While this study primarily focuses on code smell detection and privacy preservation, it opens up several avenues for future research. Specifically, there is potential for further exploration of security aspects, such as specific security attacks during machine learning phases, as well as the development of more sophisticated privacy-preserving techniques within the Federated Learning framework.</p>

<p id="S6.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Ultimately, our study bridges the gap in research related to code smell detection using closed datasets, accuracy improvement, and multi-organizational collaboration while maintaining code confidentiality as was seen in the scenario that was leveraged in this study. We acknowledge the limitations of not delving into specific security attacks, and we recognize this as an area ripe for future investigation. The implications of this research extend to practitioners who seek to elevate software quality while safeguarding data privacy and security, making it not only a significant contribution to academia but also a valuable resource for industry professionals.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Great strides have been made in developing federated learning as a distributed AI-based technique as far as the enhancement of privacy of data is concerned. However, at the time of writing this paper, there existed limited or no research that leveraged federated learning in not only detecting code smells but also preserving privacy at the same time. As a result, the research that has been reported in this paper has explored a privacy-aware approach by proposing a Federated Learning Code Smell Detection (FedCSD) that is significant for organizations. The relevance of this proposition is that it enables organizations to ensure software quality and preserve the privacy of their data at the same time by mainly sharing only knowledge as opposed to data. Specifically, in this paper, we demonstrated the application of FL in training ML to detect code smells in different companies’ code bases without the need to share those bases. Further, we presented an evolved code review life cycle that integrates our approach. Furthermore, we introduced a variety of datasets that targeted different organizations with code smells, and the outcome showed a higher accuracy not only in the evaluation metrics but also in the global model across all organisations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The FedCSD global model outperforms the cross-evaluation models, where the FedCSD model was able to detect more smells on a global level which is not detectable individually by the centralized model. Moreover, The FedCSD model shows stability and robustness compared to the results of experiments 1 and 2; even the centralized model of the first and third datasets obtained the highest accuracy, where more resources are required, and there is no data privacy preservation has been considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The novelty that backs this study shows a higher relevance when exploring code smells using FL, with dataset two achieving the lowest accuracy of 92.30% with fewer smells in Experiment 1, while datasets one and three achieved the highest accuracy with a slight difference of 98.90% and 99.5%, respectively. Consequently, in Experiment 2, a significant drop in the model accuracy, lowest accuracy 63.80% is seen where fewer smells exist in the training dataset. Ultimately, in Experiment 3, where the dataset is split into 10 companies, an accuracy of 98.34% was achieved by the global model that has been trained using 10 companies for 100 training rounds. In addition, we presented relevant studies that have utilized federated learning in a closely matching context in order to consolidate the key problem and the propositions in this paper. As a result, given that varying datasets have been used, it is the authors opinion that this study outperforms the state-of-the art FL methods. Based on above-mentioned premise, the key objective of this paper, which was identified in the earlier sections, has been reported correctly to best of our knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In view of the fore-goings, the authors reiterates that privacy being a perennial challenge among organizations, these propositions gives a guarantee of not only maintaining and preserving privacy but also an assurance of software quality through a FL code smell detection approach. However, owing to the emerging diversification in this area, there are avenues for future work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we plan to apply our proposed approach in practice by involving multiple software development companies that develop software systems in different domains. In addition, we plan to extend the approach to detect more types of code smells in software projects implemented in various programming languages. Also, it would be imperative to explore security vulnerabilities, adversarial learning in FedCSD and mitigation strategies.</p>
