<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where a shared central model is learned across distributed devices while the training data remains on these devices. Federated Averaging (<span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>) is the leading optimization method for training non-convex models in this setting with a synchronized protocol.
However, the assumptions made by FedAvg are not realistic given the heterogeneity of devices.
First, the volume and distribution of collected data vary in the training process due to different sampling rates of edge devices.
Second, the edge devices themselves also vary in latency and system configurations, such as memory, processor speed, and power requirements. This leads to vastly different computation times.
Third,
availability issues at edge devices can lead to a lack of contribution from specific edge devices to the federated model.
In this paper, we present an <span id="id7.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">As</span>ynchronous <span id="id7.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">O</span>nline <span id="id7.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated Learning (ASO-Fed) framework, where the edge devices perform online learning with continuous streaming local data and a central server aggregates model parameters from clients.
Our framework updates the central model in an asynchronous manner to tackle the challenges associated with both varying computational loads at heterogeneous edge devices and edge devices that lag behind or dropout.
We perform extensive experiments on a benchmark image dataset and three real-world datasets with non-IID streaming data. The results demonstrate ASO-Fed converging fast and maintaining good prediction performance.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As massive data is generated from modern edge devices (e.g., mobile phones, wearable devices, and GPS),
distributed model training over a large number of computing nodes has become essential for many machine learning applications.
With increasing popularity and computation power of these edge devices, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a potentially viable solution to enable the training of statistical models locally on the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
FL involves training
a shared central model from a federation of
distributed devices under the coordination of a central server; while the training data is kept on the edge device. Each edge device performs training on its local data and updates model parameters to the server for aggregation.
Many applications can leverage this FL framework such as learning activities of mobile device users, forecasting weather pollutants, and predicting health events.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many prior FL approaches use a synchronous protocol (e.g., <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and its extensions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>), where at each global iteration, the server distributes the central model to a selected portion of clients and aggregates all updates from these clients by applying a weighted averaging strategy.
These methods are costly due to a synchronization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> step (shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Asynchronous Online Federated Learning for Edge Devices with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), where the server needs to wait for all local updates before aggregation. The existence of lagging devices (i.e., stragglers, stale workers) is inevitable due to device heterogeneity and network unreliability. To address this problem, asynchronous federated
learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> were proposed, where the server can aggregate without waiting for the lagging devices. However, these asynchronous frameworks assume that the number of data samples on each device will not change during the training process, which is not practical in real-life settings. Data on local devices may increase during training, since sensors on these distributed devices usually have a high sampling frequency. In addition, Non-IID (i.e., not independent and identically distributed) and highly imbalanced characteristics of device data create challenges for effective model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we focus on the question: <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Can we develop an asynchronous online federated learning framework with a convergence rate guarantee while maintaining an optimal prediction performance?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We propose an asynchronous online federated learning framework (ASO-Fed), where the central model does not wait for collecting and aggregating the gradient information from lagging clients, and clients perform online learning to deal with local streaming data. By design, ASO-Fed enables wait-free computation and communication, which ensures the model always converges better than synchronized FL frameworks.
This study focuses on improving prediction performance and computation efficiency in FL instead of communication costs or privacy issues.
ASO-Fed shares similar privacy benefits as other general FL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> as the data does not leave the edge devices.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, we find that ASO-Fed is particularly useful for streaming data with heterogeneous devices having different computing/communication speeds. Besides the prediction performance, we also simulate different network delays for each device to show the computational efficiency of ASO-Fed.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As massive data are generated from edge devices such as mobile phones, wearable devices, and sensors, the computing power on these devices is also growing rapidly. Learning models directly on these distributed devices is gaining an increasing amount of attention.
Multi-task learning models are not suitable for edge device training given that they assume all clients (devices) participate in each training round. This requires that all clients are available because each client is training an individual specific model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, edge devices could be frequently offline during the training process due to unreliable networks or other factors. Parameter servers, where server nodes maintain globally shared parameters with data distributed on local nodes, however, often suffer from problems such as high network
bandwidth or communication overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Due to problems with stragglers and the non-IID character of edge device data, numerous other distributed optimization methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> in recent years are also not suitable for on-device learning. Federated Learning provides a promising solution that is capable of dealing with heterogeneous devices across adhoc communication networks.</p>

Many extensions have been explored based on this original federated learning setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
A better approach to deal with non-IID data distribution is proposed by sharing a small amount of data with other devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
However, all these studies update the federated model in a synchronous fashion and do not tackle the problem of stragglers and dropouts.

This involved learning separate models for each device and dealing with stragglers.

Our proposed model assumes no constraints on the server aggregation procedure and obtains the optimal prediction performance on clients with heterogeneous data. In addition, we also incorporate online learning on clients to leverage the continuous arrival of new data points.

Most existing work in online learning across multiple clients are within the multi-task learning paradigm. Each client seeks to learn an individual model, in conjunction with related clients.
The online learning problem with multiple tasks was first introduced by Dekel <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.

However, a larger number of local epochs may lead each device towards the optima of its local objective as opposed to the central objective. Besides, data continue to be generated on local devices which increases local gradient variations relative to the central model.
Therefore, we incorporate a constraint to restrict the amount of local deviation by penalizing large changes from the current model at the server. We explain this in detail in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Learning on Local Clients ‣ IV Proposed Method ‣ Asynchronous Online Federated Learning for Edge Devices with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a>.</p>

The server starts aggregation after receiving one client’s update, and performs feature learning on the aggregated parameters to extract a cross-client feature representation. Then the server starts the next iteration and distributes the new central model to the ready clients. Clients may have new data samples during the training process. To better capture the inter-client relatedness, we use a decay coefficient to balance the previous and current local gradients with an iterative local computation procedure. The approach of ASO-Fed is detailed in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ IV-B Learning on Local Clients ‣ IV Proposed Method ‣ Asynchronous Online Federated Learning for Edge Devices with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

We can observe that there is an inconsistency in the asynchronous update scheme when it comes to obtaining model parameters from the server. Such inconsistency is common in the real-world settings and is caused by data and system heterogeneity, or network delay. We address this problem by learning a global feature representation on the server and using a dynamic learning step size for training local clients.</p>

To address the potential effect on model performance caused by asynchronous updates, we apply feature representation learning on the server to extract a cross device feature representation. Attention mechanisms have shown to be effective in identifying key features and their representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Our feature learning approach is inspired by this,
and additionally, we combine weight normalization to reduce the computation cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. We use simple network architectures in this study so that it can be easily handled by mobile devices. We apply feature extraction on the first layer (e.g., LSTM or CNN in this paper) after the input to generate the feature representation, and denote the parameters of this layer as <math id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="w^{{t+1}}_{(1)}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml">w</mi><mrow id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">1</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow><mrow id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.1.cmml">+</mo><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.3" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.2">𝑤</ci><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3"><plus id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.1"></plus><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.2.2.3.3">1</cn></apply></apply><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1.1.1.1">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.18.m1.1c">w^{{t+1}}_{(1)}</annotation></semantics></math>.

In real-world settings, the activation rates, i.e., how often clients provide updates to the central model, vary due to a host of reasons. Devices with low activation rates are referred as stragglers, which are caused by several reasons such as communication bandwidth, network delay or data heterogeneity. Thus, we apply a dynamic learning step size with the intuition that if a client has more data or poor communication bandwidth, the activation rate of this client towards the central update will be small and thus the corresponding learning step size should be large. Dynamic learning step sizes are used in asynchronous optimization to achieve better learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.

Then the actual learning step size is scaled by the past communication delays. This dynamic learning step size strategy can reduce the effect of stragglers on model convergence.
Since the stragglers usually have longer delays, the larger step sizes are assigned to these lagging clients to compensate for the loss.

User sport records generated on mobile devices and uploaded to Endomondo, including multiple sources of sequential sensor data such as heart rate, speed, and GPS as well as the sport type (e.g., biking, hiking). Following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, we re-sampled the data in 10-second intervals, and further generated two derived sequences: derived distance and derived speed. We use data of randomly selected 30 users for heart rate and speed prediction, and data of each user has features of one sport type.</p>

This shows that synchronous federated frameworks do not perform well on streaming data with skewed and non-IID data distribution.
FedAsync achieves better performance than the two synchronous federated frameworks, but not as good as ASO-Fed. ASO-Fed has steady improvements with running time (and converges quickly).</p>

As seen from this table, FedAvg and FedProx have the highest computation cost across all four benchmarks. This is expected given that in synchronous protocol, the server aggregation has to wait for the slow client nodes to finish their computations.
Among the comparison of asynchronous update models, ASO-Fed is more time efficient than ASO-Fed(-D). FedAsync is close in running time as ASO-Fed(-D). From the empirical results we note that the dynamic learning step size is a promising strategy and effective when there are significant delays in the network. ASO-Fed is close to ASO-Fed(-F) in terms of computational cost except for the FitRec and ExtraSensory dataset. Because these two datasets have more complex features and additional computation for feature extraction requires more time, but ASO-Fed obtains better prediction performance with a little sacrifice of time efficiency.

For the client in ExtraSensory, the highlighted features are ‘Gyroscope’, ‘Accelerometer’ and ‘Location’, and the corresponding labels are ‘walking’, ‘at_home’.
For the client from Air Quality dataset, we observe that features with high weights are ‘Wind Speed’ and ‘Temperature’. This makes sense given that the target values are air pollutants (e,g,. PM2.5, SO) and ‘Wind Speed’ decides whether these pollutants can be dispersed. Air pollutants vary with seasons, and a higher concentration of air pollutants appears in winter time due to fuel consumption for heating in winter. Therefore ‘Temperature’ is also a strong indicator for air pollutants. For the client from FitRec, the extracted features are ‘gender’, ‘sport type’ and ‘time’. Since the prediction targets are speed and heart rate, these three features have strong correlations with the targets. The above results show the effectiveness of feature learning in ASO-Fed.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel asynchronous online federated learning approach to tackle the learning problems on distributed edge devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve asynchronous federated learning with local streaming data.
Compared to synchronized FL approaches (FedAvg and FedProx), ASO-Fed is computationally efficient since the central server does not need to wait for lagging clients to perform aggregation. Compared with asynchronous approach (FedAsync), the proposed approach achieves better performance on all provided datasets, which indicates that the proposed asynchronous update method can better handle local streaming data.
Time efficiency is compared on multiple benchmarks and the results show that the proposed ASO-Fed is faster than synchronized FL.
The proposed ASO-Fed inherits the idea of using asynchronous update scheme as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Likewise, it shares the same communication bottleneck problem pointed out in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, it is still an open issue to build communication efficient methods in asynchronous federated learning frameworks. Besides, feature learning component needs longer computation time when dealing with datasets which have complex features. Thus, there is a trade off between the prediction performance and computational costs.
In the future, we plan to develop communication efficient federated learning methods with asynchronous updating strategies.
