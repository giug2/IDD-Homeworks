<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Acquiring and annotating suitable datasets for training deep learning models is challenging. This often results in tedious and time-consuming efforts that can hinder research progress. However, generative models have emerged as a promising solution for generating synthetic datasets that can replace or augment real-world data. Despite this, the effectiveness of synthetic data is limited by their inability to fully capture the complexity and diversity of real-world data.
To address this issue, we explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks to generate synthetic datasets for training classifiers that are subsequently evaluated on real-world images. To improve the quality and diversity of the synthetic dataset, we propose three novel post-processing techniques: Dynamic Sample Filtering, Dynamic Dataset Recycle, and Expansion Trick. In addition, we introduce a pipeline called Gap Filler (GaFi), which applies these techniques in an optimal and coordinated manner to maximise classification accuracy on real-world data.
Our experiments show that GaFi effectively reduces the gap with real-accuracy scores to an error of 2.03%, 1.78%, and 3.99% on the Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively. These results represent a new state of the art in Classification Accuracy Score and highlight the effectiveness of post-processing techniques in improving the quality of synthetic datasets.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the last few years, deep generative models have become so powerful that they are able to produce high-quality samples that are almost indistinguishable from the real ones. With these recent developments, it is natural to ask whether these models are powerful enough to generate data that can be effectively used to train a machine learning model to perform a specific downstream task, thus completely replacing the real data function. This would have several advantages, for example it could significantly reduce the cost and effort of data collection, or it could be helpful in cases where information cannot be shared directly for privacy or sensitivity reasons, or where the original dataset is too large and the generative model can be used as a compressed version of the real data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In light of these considerations, and although the focus of these models has historically been on the perceptual quality of the data they generate, there have been attempts in recent years to formalise and quantify the usefulness of the synthetic data.
An essential contribution was made by Ravuri <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, who pioneered the metric called Classification Accuracy Score (CAS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Given a system for generating data, the CAS represents the accuracy performance that a classifier trained solely on its generated data is able to achieve on a test set consisting instead of real data.
Surprisingly, despite the high perceptual quality of the data generated by the latest deep learning models, and despite the ability to generate an almost unlimited number of samples, training a model on them leads to a lower CAS value than the accuracy of the same model trained on real data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigate if and how we can bridge the utility gap between synthetic data generated by generative models and real-world data. We analyse the post-processing techniques available in the literature and propose new ones to improve synthetic data quality. We then present a new post-processing pipeline, Gap Filler (GaFi), which can be applied to any generative model. GaFi combines the most effective post-processing techniques to achieve a significantly better generator, without the need to modify the model’s architecture or learning technique.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past decade, deep learning has seen a surge in the development of generative models that are capable of producing synthetic data with increasing similarity to real-world training data. Some of the key architectures that have contributed to this progress include Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
These models have been predominantly used in the field of computer vision, particularly for image generation. To measure the perceptual quality of generated images, various metrics have been proposed, of which the Inception Score (IS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and the Frécht Inception Distance (FID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> are the most significant.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, the creation of synthetic datasets, either to replace or to complement real-world ones, has gained increasing attention in machine learning applications. Synthetic data can offer significant advantages, such as the possibility to generate large-scale datasets with known properties, reducing the need for costly data collection and annotation, and overcoming issues related to data privacy and access.
The use of generative models for synthetic data generation has found applications in several fields, including semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, optical flow estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, human motion understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A fundamental contribution to the advancement of this alternative use of generative models has been made by Ravuri <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, which focused on evaluating the performance of GANs through a downstream classifier, introducing the Classification Accuracy Score (CAS) metric <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The underlying idea is to train a classifier with synthetic images and evaluate its performance on a test set composed of real images. The challenge behind this proposal is that if a generative model captures in an optimal way the real data distribution, performance on the downstream task should be similar whether using the original or synthetic data.
Unfortunately, achieving comparable performance between classifiers trained on real and synthetic data remains a challenge. Significant efforts have been made to bridge this accuracy gap.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">One notable approach is the <span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sample Filtering</span> technique proposed by Dat <span id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which aims to optimise the quality of the data generated. The technique uses an auxiliary classifier trained on real data to predict the labels of synthetic samples. Samples with incorrect predictions or those with low prediction confidence are discarded. In addition, the authors propose the use of <span id="S2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">multiple generative models</span> to improve the accuracy of synthetic data by better capturing the real data distribution.
Another approach to address the accuracy gap is the <span id="S2.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Dataset Smoothing</span> technique proposed by Besnier <span id="S2.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The present study aims to execute a comprehensive post-processing pipeline that can be applied to a broad range of generative models with the intention of improving their Classification Accuracy Score (CAS).

As demonstrated in their ablation study, varying the filtering threshold may result in a synthetic dataset of superior quality compared to static filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
To this end, we introduce Dynamic Sample Filtering, a two-step technique. Firstly, we utilize a classifier to predict the generated samples, thereby discarding all incorrectly classified samples. Secondly, we define a range of filtering thresholds, incrementally increasing from 0 to 0.9. For each threshold, we construct a standalone dataset consisting of only the correctly predicted samples with confidence greater or equal to the threshold.
We generate new data until the filtered samples reach the desired amount for each synthetic dataset. Finally, we train a classifier for each dataset and save the threshold value of the one achieving the best CAS. This technique helps eliminate low-quality images that could negatively impact the performance of the downstream classifier.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Dynamic Dataset Recycle</span> Inspired by Besnier <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, we propose to extend their Dataset Smoothing technique, which has shown significant benefits in their research. Our approach, called Dynamic Dataset Recycle, differs from the original in that it replaces the entire synthetic dataset in each iteration, rather than just a portion.
Our ablation studies show that recycling the entire dataset leads to better performance in terms of CAS.
Furthermore, to address the issue of time complexity, which is proportional to the size of the generated dataset, we propose to generalise its use by recycling the dataset every N epochs of classifier training.</p>

Instead of truncating the input noise space, we expand it by sampling from a normal distribution with a higher standard deviation than that used in model training. By increasing the diversity of the input noise space, our method encourages the generative model to explore regions that were less sampled during training. This leads to the production of more diverse and novel images, a desirable outcome in settings where diversity is prioritised over visual quality.
However, as expected, the increased standard deviation of the input noise distribution reduces the quality of individual samples. Therefore, the Expansion Trick is most effective when combined with sample filtering techniques. This mitigates the negative effects of lower sample quality by selecting only the most relevant samples to train the classifier.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the results of our experiments. We start by analysing the individual impact of each proposed post-processing technique. The results of these techniques are evaluated based on the final checkpoint of the generative model, i.e. without the application of the Checkpoint Optimization step. Finally, we present the results of the whole GaFi pipeline.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Dynamic Sample Filtering</span> As we can see from Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Bridging the Gap: Enhancing the Utility of Synthetic Data via Post-Processing Techniques" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the use of the Sample Filtering technique is beneficial for all the datasets in analysis.
However, from this table it can be seen that the optimal threshold value is highly dependant on the specific dataset. For instance, the CAS for <span id="S5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Fashion-MNIST</span> and <span id="S5.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CIFAR-10</span> remains almost constant for any threshold value, while for the <span id="S5.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CIFAR-100</span> it is clearly visible that a higher threshold value degrades the performance of the classifier. We assume that this behaviour is due to the fact that the generators trained on the first two datasets, being easier to learn, produce images that are very faithful to the original dataset. Therefore, the classifiers pretrained on real images will have high confidence in their predictions and most of the bad images will already be removed due to incorrect labelling. In contrast, <span id="S5.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CIFAR-100</span> is a much more complex dataset as it has 10 times the number of classes, causing the generated images to be more likely rejected by the pretrained classifier when a high filtering threshold is used. On average, with respect to the baseline CAS achieved, i.e. the "No Filtering" column of the table, the Dynamic Sample Filtering technique improves the CAS by 2%.</p>

Notably, by reducing the recycling period, i.e. generating new synthetic data more frequently during training, we can obtain an additional performance boost.
The gain in accuracy is more pronounced with increasing dataset complexity, as expected, since the generative model may require more attempts before generating meaningful data, especially for those classes learnt with poor effectiveness.</p>

The results indicate that when the dataset is unfiltered, there is a small increase in performance when using a standard deviation slightly higher than 1. However, as the standard deviation increases, there is a degradation in performance. This outcome is not unexpected, as a higher standard deviation leads to more diverse images but at the cost of image quality. As a result, beyond a certain point, the images become too degraded to be useful for training a downstream classifier. On the other hand, when using the Expansion Trick with a sample filtering technique, we can achieve significantly higher standard deviation values without compromising performance. This is because only the "good" images that meet the filtering criteria - in this case, the correctly classified ones - are kept, ensuring that the dataset is more diverse while still containing higher-quality images than the unfiltered dataset, leading to a higher classification accuracy.

Bearing in mind that each point corresponds to the complete training of a ResNet-20 classifier, the aim of this step is to identify the best checkpoint with respect to the CAS metric, even though it may be computationally expensive.
Looking at the graphs, the <span id="S5.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Fashion-MINST</span> dataset shows an optimal range of epochs between 90 and 120, while for the <span id="S5.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CIFAR-10</span> and <span id="S5.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CIFAR-100</span> datasets the optimal range is around epoch 450. It is noteworthy that the CAS increases with the number of epochs increases, up to a certain point. It is arguable that the complexity of the dataset is only partially indicative of the range in which to search for CAS, as can be assumed from the graphs of the <span id="S5.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CIFAR-10</span> and <span id="S5.p5.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CIFAR-100</span> datasets.
In any case, this behaviour is consistent with that of GANs from the point of view of the perceptual quality of the generated images, which tend to collapse after a certain number of training iterations.
Overall, the Checkpoint Optimization step is fundamental and allows the next steps of the GaFi pipeline to proceed from the optimal generative model.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we introduced the Gap Filler pipeline (GaFi) to enhance the Classification Accuracy Score (CAS) by proposing new and enhanced post-processing techniques for generative models. These techniques included Dynamic Sample Filtering, Dynamic Dataset Recycle, and Expansion Trick, which have been shown to be highly beneficial when applied correctly. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed pipeline significantly increased the CAS, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance on the three datasets analysed.
Despite our research yielding an accuracy that was slightly lower than that obtained on real data, we believe that the remaining gap raises a philosophical question about the very essence of generative modeling: whether it is possible to produce a model that can perfectly learn the distribution of real data. However, we remain optimistic that it is achievable.
We acknowledge that there are challenges that need to be addressed to bridge this gap, but we are confident that once this is achieved, it would open up new avenues for research and revolutionize several fields.</p>
