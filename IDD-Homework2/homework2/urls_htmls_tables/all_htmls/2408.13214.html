<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Accurate forecasting of the EUR/USD exchange rate is crucial for investors, businesses, and policymakers. This paper proposes a novel framework, IUS, that integrates unstructured textual data from news and analysis with structured data on exchange rates and financial indicators to enhance exchange rate prediction. The IUS framework employs large language models for sentiment polarity scoring and exchange rate movement classification of texts. These textual features are combined with quantitative features and input into a Causality-Driven Feature Generator. An Optuna-optimized Bi-LSTM model is then used to forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark models, reducing MAE by 10.69% and RMSE by 9.56% compared to the best performing baseline. Results also show the benefits of data fusion, with the combination of unstructured and structured data yielding higher accuracy than structured data alone. Furthermore, feature selection using the top 12 important quantitative features combined with the textual features proves most effective. The proposed IUS framework and Optuna-Bi-LSTM model provide a powerful new approach for exchange rate forecasting through multi-source data integration.</span></p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar is a significant indicator in the global financial market, reflecting the economic dynamics between two of the world’s largest economies. Precise prediction of the EUR/USD exchange rate is crucial for individual investors, businesses engaged in international trade, and policymakers responsible for economic stability and growth. Traditionally, econometric models have been utilized to forecast exchange rates, relying heavily on historical market data and macroeconomic indicators released by governments and financial organizations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Although these datasets are comprehensive, their low publication frequency makes it difficult to capture real-time market volatility and nonlinear dynamics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The integration of unstructured data from diverse sources, such as news articles, financial reports and social media platforms, has the potential to improve the accuracy of exchange rate forecasting. In recent years, the significant impact of political events, global economic crises, and unexpected international incidents on currency fluctuations has been recognized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, suggesting that considering a wider range of information beyond traditional structured data may be beneficial. The great amount of textual data may contain valuable insights into market sentiment, economic trends, and key events that can influence exchange rates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, exchange rate forecasting presents two significant challenges. Firstly, while the relationship between news information and market trends is relatively straightforward in traditional financial markets, the complex semantics of market-driven news and analysis texts in the context of exchange rates pose difficulties for sentiment analysis. Secondly, traditional methods struggle to adequately capture the complex nonlinear patterns and unstructured relationships hidden within the textual data, limiting their ability to provide accurate predictions in the dynamically changing foreign exchange market<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent attempts to address these challenges by integrating textual data and deep learning methods show promise, but limitations still exist. Singh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> propose using Word2Vec and LSTM to classify collected Weibo text data and assign sentiment weights to each word. The sentiment analysis results are then incorporated into a CNN-LSTM hybrid model for exchange rate prediction. However, the texts related to exchange rates often contain news or comments about two countries simultaneously, making it challenging to accurately attribute the content to a specific country. The existence of massive noise and the involvement of information related to two currencies in the text used for exchange rate forecasting create challenges in handling lengthy texts and complex semantics. Tadphale et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> utilize news headlines for sentiment analysis and then combine with other market indicators as inputs to an LSTM model for exchange rate prediction. While this approach shows potential, news headlines have limited information content and lack complete context due to text length. Moreover, the news of each day may also have a potential impact on the exchange rate movement of the next day, which is not fully captured by the proposed approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel framework that integrates unstructured and structured (IUS) data to forecast EUR/USD exchange rates. We use ChatGPT-4.0 to filter out noise from collected news and analysis texts, extracting segments related to the exchange rate, in order to obtain the initial dataset. The dataset is then annotated with sentiment polarity scores by ChatGPT-4.0 and next-day exchange rate movements, e.g. up or down. Subsequently, we fine-tune two large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to create textual features, textual sentiment and exchange rate movement features. Next, the collected exchange rate and financial market data are utilized to generate quantitative features, which are integrated with textual features and inputted into a Causality-Driven Feature Generator. Finally, all generated features are fed into an Optuna-Bi-LSTM model to predict the EUR/USD exchange rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of processing news articles containing information about both countries in an exchange rate pair, handling high noise, complex semantics, the lack of contextual information in brief texts, and the various extraction of textual features. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed exchange rate prediction approach on our EUR/USD exchange rate dataset. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms the strongest benchmark models by 10.69% in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and by 9.56% in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). As for data fusion, by combining unstructured and structured data, the Optuna-Bi-LSTM model is able to enhance prediction accuracy beyond what is possible with structured data alone. Furthermore, using the top 12 important features selected by the RFE method combined with 31 textual features proves to be more effective compared to analyzing all textual features, as it more directly corresponds to the actual exchange rate response to market conditions.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional sentiment analysis methods in exchange rate prediction have primarily focused on brief texts such as Twitter posts and news headlines. These methods neglect the rich semantics and diverse information contained within longer content, which are essential for a thorough understanding of market sentiment. Additionally, the effectiveness of dictionary-based sentiment analysis heavily depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of predefined word lists. These methods face challenges in adapting to a changing market because sentiment dictionaries tend to be static and are not immediately updated, thus failing to reflect domain-specific vocabulary. More critically, traditional methods struggle to capture the differences in numerical data and its implications for market sentiment. However, in a financial context, the extent of data growth and the variations in percentages often reflect market fluctuations. For instance, a 0.005% increase in a specific data point might influence the market differently compared to a 50% increase.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The relationship between news information and market trends is relatively straightforward in traditional markets, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Motivation ‣ EUR/USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. However, the complex semantics of news and analysis texts in the context of exchange rates pose difficulties for sentiment analysis. The nature of financial texts makes sentiment analysis and annotation a particularly challenging task, as it often contains specialized jargon, implicit sentiments linked to market conditions, and subtle variations across different sectors. Moreover, exchange rates involve two countries, and the impact of primarily positive or negative news on financial markets can be significant. For instance, an abundance of positive news about the U.S. can lead to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which typically results in a decrease in the EUR/USD exchange rate, and vice versa. However, news texts often contain associated information related to both countries, making classification difficult, and the positive or negative news from both countries has a zero-sum relationship in the final sentiment analysis.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the challenges of sentiment analysis in extensive financial texts, we utilize the capabilities of LLMs. As depicted in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Motivation ‣ EUR/USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(A), LLMs are structured with deep and hierarchical Transformer blocks, each featuring a multi-head self-attention mechanism. This architecture allows LLMs to recognize complex patterns and capture long-range dependencies within the text. As texts progress through these Transformer blocks, illustrated in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Motivation ‣ EUR/USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(B), the multiple attention heads within a block enable simultaneous focus on various textual elements. The different lines represent the varying attention paid by the multi-head attention mechanism to elements at different positions, revealing complex interrelationships even among distant sentences. Following this, the layered structure shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Motivation ‣ EUR/USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(C), with its consistent application of self-attention, effectively addresses the complexities of lengthy financial texts. By recognizing long-distance dependencies and maintaining focus on relevant elements throughout the input, LLMs can analyze every detail of the text to generate an overall sentiment polarity score. Moreover, LLMs have the ability to capture the differences in numerical data, enabling them to provide more accurate sentiment polarity scores that reflect the actual impact of these figures on market sentiment.</p>

Pfahler <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> employs artificial neural networks and gradient-boosted decision trees to forecast exchange rate movements using macroeconomic fundamentals from purchasing power parity, uncovered interest rate parity, and monetary model theories. These machine learning models outperform the random walk benchmark, especially when time dummies are included, highlighting the potential of complex interactions between time dummies and fundamentals in exchange rate forecasting. Khoa and Huynh <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> apply SVR under the uncovered interest rate parity framework to forecast the VND/USD exchange rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Combining the framework with the robust SVR technique demonstrates superior performance compared to OLS regression and random walk models. However, these econometric models and traditional machine learning techniques face limitations in capturing the complex, non-linear dynamics and high-dimensional relationships inherent in exchange rate data.</p>

<p id="S3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> introduce a methodology that combines LSTM with bagging ensemble learning, significantly enhancing the accuracy and profitability of exchange rate forecasts. This method outperforms traditional benchmark models, although it is solely applied to univariate exchange rate series without considering additional influencing factors. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> develop an innovative LASSO-Bi-LSTM ensemble learning strategy that merges the LASSO with Bi-LSTM networks for forecasting the USD/CNY exchange rate. This approach demonstrates superior accuracy over other deep learning models but is limited to short-term forecasts and is not tested in broader financial markets. Islam and Hossain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> craft a hybrid model that integrates GRU and LSTM networks to predict currency prices in the forex market for key pairs. The hybrid model surpasses the performance of LSTM, GRU and a simple moving average approach in terms of accuracy and risk-adjusted returns. Despite its success, the model sometimes struggles with abrupt price fluctuations and requires specific adjustments for optimal performance with the GBP/USD pair. Dautel et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> conduct an empirical analysis comparing various deep learning frameworks, including LSTM and GRU networks, for exchange rate prediction. The study provides valuable insights into the practical application of these models for financial forecasting, though it acknowledges challenges in model tuning and the disparity between statistical accuracy and economic relevancy. Wan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> introduce the Multivariate TCN, which uses a deep CNN with multichannel residual blocks and an asymmetric structure to enhance forecasting in aperiodic multivariate time series. This model shows marked improvements over other algorithms, and the study suggests that focusing on higher-order statistical features could simplify the model and boost performance. Zeng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> critically assess the efficacy of Transformer-based solutions for long-term time series forecasting, proposing a straightforward one-layer linear model, which outperforms more complex Transformer-based models across multiple datasets. However, the simplicity of this model limits its capacity.
Optimization algorithms play a vital role in improving the performance of deep learning networks by systematically tuning their hyperparameters. Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> propose a Particle Swarm Optimization with LSTM (PSO-LSTM) model that leverages particle swarm optimization to optimize LSTM hyperparameters, mimicking the social behavior of bird flocking to discover optimal solutions.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the textual dataset, we collect data from investing.com and forexempire.com, covering the period from February 6, 2016, to January 19, 2024. The dataset includes all accessible data on these platforms within the period, totaling 35,427 texts. However, due to the potential existence of noise and irrelevant information, we utilize ChatGPT-4.0 and prompt engineering techniques to filter the raw dataset. This data annotation approach aligns with prior research, such as using LLMs for automatic data annotation to detect hallucinations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, keyword annotation and document content description generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and math problem knowledge tagging with few-shot learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. After filtering, we observe that the news and analysis texts inherently contain a higher level of noise, which may be attributed to the necessity of catering to the diverse needs of readers. In addition, we notice that often only individual paragraphs or multiple segments within an article are directly relevant to the EUR/USD exchange rate. To further refine the dataset and extract the relevant segments, we employ ChatGPT-4.0 again to process the text data, creating a final textual dataset consisting of 20,329 texts.
We employ ChatGPT-4.0 to annotate the sentiment polarity scores for the textual training dataset by integrating prompt engineering techniques. To safeguard against potential and unidentified errors, the model is also required to provide explanations for the polarity scores it assigns. In our prompt engineering, we define the polarity score range as [-1,1], where scores approaching 1 indicate a strongly positive sentiment, and vice versa. Scores near zero represent a neutral sentiment.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">One of the primary advantages of RoBERTa-Large is its ability to learn robust and transferable language representations. By pre-training on extensive unlabelled text data, RoBERTa-Large develops a deep comprehension of language structure and semantics. As the input flows through each encoding layer, data move from the bottom to the top of the model, with representations becoming increasingly improved and enriched, thereby constructing hierarchical and contextualized embeddings of the text. Therefore, in our SPSM and MCM, we employ two RoBERTa-Large models as the embedding generators. Each text is processed by the RoBERTa-based tokenizer and then fed into the Encoder layer (<math id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\textit{encoder}(\cdot)" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_italic" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.2a.cmml">encoder</mtext><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">⋅</mo><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2"><times id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.2a.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.2"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_italic" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.2.2">encoder</mtext></ci><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">⋅</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\textit{encoder}(\cdot)</annotation></semantics></math>), generating the model’s hidden states (<math id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.2.m2.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math>):</p>

By minimizing the MSE loss function, the model learns the mapping relationship between text and sentiment scores. The backpropagation algorithm is used to compute gradients and update the parameters of RoBERTa-Large and SPSM, continually refining the predicted sentiment scores to approach the annotated scores. In addition, we discover that when using the Twitter-RoBERTa-Large-2022-154m model, convergence is faster, and performance on evaluation metrics is superior compared to the base model without fine-tuning, given the same number of training epochs.</p>

These produced tensors have the same dimensions as the original feature tensor, which are then processed through a task-specific linear layer, mapping the three-dimensional feature tensors to feature matrices. As for the stage of feature generation, the feature matrices are inputted into an average pooling layer to yield a diverse set of textual features. Subsequently, all textual features combined with other features undergo feature selection to obtain the final set of features inputted into the forecasting model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In terms of feature extraction, we employ two types of feature extractors. The first one is a classifier based on information sources, inspired by the research of Angeletos et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>]</cite> and Ke et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>]</cite>. We construct a classifier for news and analysis texts. The news texts encompass a broad spectrum of content related to exchange rates, including central bank monetary policies, economic data releases, geopolitical events, and other significant factors influencing exchange rate trends. In contrast, the analysis texts primarily focus on interpreting, forecasting, and providing recommendations concerning exchange rate movements, typically authored by professional analysts or traders, characterized by their expertise and forward-looking nature. This feature classifier, as depicted in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.2.1 Causality-Driven Feature Generator ‣ 4.2 Causality-Driven Feature Generator ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ EUR/USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(A), generates news text classification matrix <math id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">A</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐴</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">A</annotation></semantics></math> and analysis text classification matrix <math id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="B" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">B</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐵</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1c">B</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p3.2" class="ltx_p">After adjusting all features to their optimal lag orders, we employ the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method with random forest regression to rank the importance of all indicators. RFE is a backward elimination algorithm that recursively removes the least important features until the desired number of features is determined <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>, <a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>]</cite>. Random forest regressor, an ensemble of decision trees each trained on a bootstrap sample of the training data, determines the importance of each feature by averaging the decrease in impurity this feature causes across all trees in the forest. This decrease in impurity, also known as Gini importance or mean decrease impurity, enhances prediction accuracy and minimizes overfitting.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework that efficiently searches for the optimal set of hyperparameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>, <a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite>. Its core principle is to generate trials, each testing a different combination of hyperparameters, while using the results of previous trials to guide the sampling of parameters in subsequent trials. This sampling, combined with the ability to prune underperforming trials, allows Optuna to quickly converge on the best hyperparameter configuration.</p>

The process begins by defining an objective function for constructing, training, and evaluating the model. Subsequently, an Optuna Study object is created to manage the optimization process, and the optimization loop then begins, generating new hyperparameters based on the results of previous trials. Each trial is represented by a Trial object and passed to the objective function. Inside the objective function, the suggest method of the Trial object is utilized to obtain hyperparameter values. The model is built and trained using these hyperparameters, and intermediate results are reported by the Trial’s report method. If the pruning criteria are met, the trial is terminated; otherwise, training continues until the objective function is completed. The final evaluation result is returned, and the trial results are stored. This process is repeated until the maximum number of trials is reached. Finally, the best hyperparameter combination is obtained from the Study object.</p>

This analysis helps determine the optimal window size that maximizes the accuracy of time series predictions. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure <a href="#S6.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ 6.1.3 Window Size Analysis ‣ 6.1 Main Results ‣ 6 Experiment Results ‣ EUR/USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>.

The results show that in the scenario where only textual features are inputted, the model’s performance is far inferior to the scenarios using only financial features and all selected features. This indicates that textual features alone may not provide sufficient predictive information for exchange rate forecasting. Moreover, when using Optuna-Bi-LSTM, the combination of textual and financial features achieves the best performance, outperforming the case of using only financial features.</p>

Whether in terms of MAE or RMSE, the improvement of combined features over financial features alone in the Optuna-Bi-LSTM model significantly outperforms that of the Bi-LSTM model. The overall prediction results suggest that textual and financial features are complementary to each other and are suitable for exchange rate prediction. When unstructured data and structured data are combined in a predictive model, significant accuracy improvements can be achieved.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct several ablation experiments to analyze the effectiveness of each textual feature generated by the IUS framework. In each experiment, we include the exchange rate and financial market features (the top 12 important features selected by the RFE method) as a fixed set of predictors. The textual feature sets we evaluate include: (A) features obtained through SSM and Source Classification, (B) features obtained through SSM and LDA Cluster, (C) features obtained through MCM and Source Classification, and (D) features obtained through MCM and LDA Cluster. We use (A + B + C + D) to represent the complete set of predictive features, including both textual and financial features, and (0) to represent no textual features, only the fixed set of financial features.</p>

As the financial features increase from 1 to 12, both curves reach their minimum values. Subsequently, both curves rise steeply. This indicates that as the number of features increases, noise is introduced into the predictive model, thereby gradually reducing its predictive capability. Overall, the top 12 important features selected by the RFE method, combined with 31 textual features, constitute a robust feature set for predicting exchange rates.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To accurately forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate, we introduced the IUS framework and an Optuna-Bi-LSTM model. This framework integrates multi-source information, including news and analytical texts, other relevant exchange rates, and financial market indicators. We employ two large language models for sentiment polarity scoring and exchange rate movement classification, which are then combined with other quantitative indicators input into a Causality-Driven Feature Generator. All generated features are fed into the predictive model for exchange rate forecasting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the strongest benchmarks, our method achieved the highest MAE and RMSE, improving by at least 10.69% and 9.56%, respectively. In terms of data fusion, by combining unstructured and structured data, the model is able to enhance prediction accuracy beyond what is possible with structured data alone. Furthermore, using the top 12 important features selected by the RFE method, combined with 31 textual features proves to be more effective compared to analyzing all textual features, as it more directly corresponds to the actual exchange rate response to market conditions. In summary, the proposed method achieves better performance in exchange rate forecasting and provides a comprehensive approach by integrating multi-source data for enhanced prediction accuracy.</p>
