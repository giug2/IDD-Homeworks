<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain based federated learning is a distributed learning scheme that allows model training without participants sharing their local data sets, where the blockchain components eliminate the need for a trusted central server compared to traditional Federated Learning algorithms. In this paper we propose a softmax aggregation blockchain based federated learning framework. First, we propose a new blockchain based federated learning architecture that utilizes the well-tested proof-of-stake consensus mechanism on an existing blockchain network to select validators and miners to aggregate the participants’ updates and compute the blocks. Second, to ensure the robustness of the aggregation process, we design a novel softmax aggregation method based on approximated population loss values that relies on our specific blockchain architecture. Additionally, we show our softmax aggregation technique converges to the global minimum in the convex setting with non-restricting assumptions. Our comprehensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing robust aggregation algorithms in various settings by large margins.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning schema that allows participants to collectively train a model using all available data without the need of actually sharing potentially sensitive data to each other <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The central server aggregates the participants’ model updates without accessing their local data. This is particularly favorable as data privacy issues become major concerns in the modern world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. It has a wide range of applications including predictive healthcare, learning user behavior on cell phones, and autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, traditional FL frameworks rely on a central server to coordinate the training process and suffer from having a single point of failure. If the server becomes compromised either by external attack or network failures, the entire FL process fails. To eliminate the need of trusted centralized servers, Blockchain based federated learning (BCFL) architectures are proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain technology has been first used by Bitcoin and has since gained popularity in many fields such as cryptocurrency, healthcare, and finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>; <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Blockchains are fully decentralized and can hold immutable records in blocks. Additionally, participants can earn rewards based on contribution. BCFL builds on the recent popularity and success of the blockchain technology and utilizes consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to synchronize model updates, therefore enabling participants to aggregate local models without the need of a trusted centralized entity. BCFL has the additional benefit of being resilient to a single point of failure, and encouraging participation to be trustworthy by providing incentives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, many BCFL schemes create their own rewards based on their blockchains which do not have much value out side of the scope. Additionally, BCFL in itself cannot defend against adversarial attacks, and recent works on robust aggregation methods as defending schemes are limited to specific settings and are not applicable to more general cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the above limitations of existing frameworks, we propose a softmax aggregation blockchain based federated learning framework named SABFL (Softmax Aggregation on Blockchain based Federated Learning). It relies on any existing blockchain network to handle the rewards, it utilizes the PoS consensus mechanism, and has a softmax robust aggregation method designed specifically for the architecture. Our blockchain structure has three types of participants: workers, validators, and miners. In a PoS scheme, validators and miners are generally viewed as trusted parties because they are at risk of losing their staking if they are dishonest. They are also participants with their own local data sets selected based on the size of their stakings. We further assume that participants with more significant stakes have larger and more representative training and validation data sets. Workers utilize only training data. Therefore, if we use the validators’ data sets to approximate the population data set, and calculate the approximated population loss for each of the workers, the loss values can be used to describe the efforts of workers. Finally, we design a softmax based approach to map the approximated loss values to weights assigned to each worker’s model update that are used in final aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the experiments, we examine the performance of SABFL in a wide range of settings with participants having iid or non-iid local data sets using different machine learning models on various tasks. We show that SABFL achieves better performance by a large margin when compared to existing works. Crucially, we also explore the less studied areas including when up to half validators become dishonest and when clients have heterogeneity in data set sizes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We summarize our main contributions as follows. First, we propose SABFL, a new blockchain based FL framework. It has all the benefits of BCFL architectures and the additional merit of providing universally accepted rewards. Second, we introduce a softmax based aggregation technique that is robust to data heterogeneity in both size and distribution, and performs well when there are malicious attacks. Additionally, we show that the softmax aggregation technique converges to the global minimum in the convex setting under mild assumptions. Third, our experiments expose that clients with varying sample sizes can seriously harm the accuracy of traditional FL schemes, which has been largely overlooked thus far. The experiment results also corroborate the claim that softmax aggregation is robust in different situations including even when up to half of the validators are colluding with malicious participants to carry out an attack.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our work is related to BCFL architectures and the robustness of FL systems. Chen et al also focus on BCFL and robustness of its framework. They propose VBFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> which utilizes the differences of training accuracy between the workers and the validators to set a hard threshold that is then used to determine a binary vote of the workers’ uploaded gradients. They also devise a clever reward mechanism that is based on the votes and the local training data set sizes of the participants. However, the hard threshold is fixed across the global rounds and is tested only on one data set with one model when in fact it can depend on the global round number and can vary significantly if the underlying data set or model changes. Additionally, sample size information can be sensitive in FL applications and cannot be easily verified.
Another limitation is that their participants have iid data sets, and when malicious participants are selected as validators, they act honorably in all but one experiment. We improve these drawbacks by introducing non-iid data sets, malicious validators in our testing, and an algorithm that captures such settings. Lastly, the gradient updates in VBFL are either included or excluded in the aggregation computation, and this may discourage participants with less computing resources and is not suitable for some BCFL applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Li et al propose BFLC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the concept of a new BCFL framework. They discuss utilizing a few honest participants’ data as validation set to perform k-fold validation. However, k-fold validation is not resource efficient and it is uncertain how to select honest workers. Other works on BCFL or decentralized FL are primarily focused on the blockchain architecture, or the operations and interactions of different participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>; <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>; <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>; <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>; <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Although they may introduce participant reputation mechanisms to handle adversarial attacks, the experiments with malicious participants are often limited and are not the main focus. Other BCFL works design novel consensus mechanisms to ensure system security and robustness. For example, Kang et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> introduce proof of verification that can validate gradient updates using a global test set. However, this framework requires a global trusted authority, thus diminishing the decentralized nature of the BCFL schema. Additionally, the global test set is not always available in many BCFL applications. Similarly, Chen et al research the security of proof of elapsed time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. It also requires a trusted computing technology and the system can be jeopardized with a relatively small fraction of participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Several papers suggest that poisoning and Byzantine attacks are serious threats to the FL paradigm, and this is also true in the BCFL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>; <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>; <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>; <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Robust aggregation techniques can counter the effect of such attacks. Some popular methods include Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, trimmed mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. These methods also provide convergence guarantee under mild assumptions. Other methods include Foolsgold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and a more recent Mandera algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. However, we show that existing methods either are not suitable in the BCFL setting, or they perform worse when compared to SABFL in our comprehensive experiments. This is due to the robustness of SABFL against the number and roles of malicious participants as well as the heterogeneity in both the participant’s data set sizes and distributions.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing BCFL architectures can be grouped into three categories based on the roles of participants and blockchains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>: fully coupled, flexibly coupled, and loosely coupled BCFL schemes. In fully coupled BCFL, all nodes work in the blockchain network, in a flexibly coupled BCFL only miners participate in the generation of blocks, and in a loosely coupled BCFL, the blockchain is only used to distribute and record rewards. In all three architectures, rewards are generated when blocks are created similar to existing cryptocurrencies. However, one major drawback of these architectures is that the created rewards may not be widely accepted outside the BCFL scope thus disincentivizing participation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We propose SABFL which consists of two components. The first component is some existing blockchain network such as Ethereum that is used to handle validator and miner selection and reward management. Validators and miners are selected based on the stakes on the Ethereum network which are easily verifiable. Additionally, the rewards are given in Ethereum, which is universally accepted and has high liquidity thus encouraging participation. The nature of Ethereum also ensures that validators and miners are less likely to become malicious since they have more to lose when compared to traditional BCFL frameworks. The second component is the BCFL layer where the selected validators verify the participants’ updates and upload them to miners to compile into blocks similar to the process of a fully coupled BCFL scheme. Therefore, SABFL maintains the decentralized nature avoiding single point of failure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the SABFL architecture has all the benefits of a decentralized FL schema. Additionally, the reliance on an existing blockchain network has the added benefits of encouraging participation with more enticing rewards, and ensuring security by disincentivizing malicious behavior of the validators and miners.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we discuss the components of SABFL in detail. If there are several miners, they do not impact SABFL and thus we assume that there is a single miner. The first step of SABFL is for an entity to initiate a machine learning task and post the total rewards on the existing blockchain network. Note that the task posting entity does not need to be trusted as long as the rewards are verified, thus the decentralized nature of BCFL is maintained. A block consists of validators’ local loss values using the weights of the workers, the scores assigned to the weights of the workers by the miner, gradients from every worker, and the updated weight of the model for the next training round. A block can be validated by computing the scores assigned to the weights of the workers using the deterministic formula with the loss values of the validators, and by computing the aggregated gradient using our softmax aggregation formula.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The softmax aggregation technique can also be generalized to the traditional FL setting. It is trivial if there exists a large globally available test set. Otherwise, the central server can designate a few clients as validators based on accumulated reputation or some other criteria and send them all workers’ model updates. Then the validators can send back the approximated population loss values and the central server can utilize the loss values to complete the softmax aggregation process. However, it is worth noting that without the existing blockchain network, this procedure is at risk of having a larger number of malicious validators when compared to SABFL.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main focus of the experiments is to study the robustness of the softmax aggregation method in various settings. The experimental settings are summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.1 Design of Experiments ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Robust softmax aggregation on blockchain based federated learning with convergence guarantee" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The first six experiments are on the MNIST data set with a varying number of benign and malicious participant combinations. Additionally, each of these experiments is run with two versions with participants having different levels of heterogeneity in data size and distribution with details in the next section. Column ‘Options’ lists the number and type of experiment. LH cases correspond to low heterogeneity in data (heavily non-iid), HH is low heterogeneity (mild non-iid), and character ‘E’ represents more local training epochs. In total there are 16 experiments. The remaining three experiments aim to show the performance of softmax aggregation on different data sets and models including CNN, RNN, and a feed-forward neural network, and they are run with participants having iid data. We opted for 8 malicious clients since the goal of these experiments is to show that the underlying model does not affect the relative performance of SABFL, and the results of the MNIST experiments show that SABFL is robust against different portions of malicious clients.</p>

Bulyan uses a concept similar to that of Krum, Foolsgold can only handle one kind of attack at a time and fails when only one attacker is present whereas SABFL does not rely on the number of malicious participants, and Mandera relies on the non-deterministic k-means algorithms for clustering and is not suitable in the BCFL setting. We also include the vanilla FedAvg for comparison <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.

In our experiments, the malicious participants perform the label flipping attack due to its effectiveness and general applicability. Compared to the sign flipping and mean shift attacks, label flipping does not require having information on the honest workers’ updates, and when compared to Gaussian noise attacks, it does not rely on an ad-hoc covariance matrix. Additionally, label flipping is one kind of a model poisoning attack in our setting as it affects the gradient updates, and it is considered more effective than data poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. We also allow malicious workers to be selected as validators, and when selected, they collude with the malicious workers and evaluate loss values based on the flipped labels. We require that the portion of malicious validators is no more than half, because for a PoS scheme it is more rational to uphold the integrity of the system when one controls more than half of the stakes.

For FashionMNIST, we use a similar structure but with two hidden layers of size 600 and 120. The feed forward neural network for the Forest Cover Type data set has two hidden layers of size 1,000 and 500. Finally, the recurrent neural network for IMDB sentiment classification consists of a 64 dimensional embedding layer, 2 layers of LSTM, and a hidden layer of size 256. All of the architectures selected are able to reach a final accuracy similar to the state-of-the-art in the traditional machine learning setting. Finally, the framework has been implemented in PyTorch using Google Colab with Nvidia Tesla T4 GPUs and Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.00GHz.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We run each experiment five times and report the average final accuracy. In this section we present our main experimental findings, and the complete results are included in the Appendix. The first finding is that clients having various samples sizes can be a significant threat to FL systems that has been overlooked in the past studies, and softmax aggregation is a defense. Although vanilla FL can be considered having the perfect defense against varying sample sizes, in real-world cases, samples sizes of FL participants can be sensitive business information and should not be shared. Existing works on aggregation methods are less studied on non-iid data, and even more so in cases where participants have different sample sizes. The study of the effect of size differences on FL systems is summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.3 Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Robust softmax aggregation on blockchain based federated learning with convergence guarantee" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. The numbers in bold represent the best performance and those in italics the second best. It is expected that vanilla performs best since it is using private information, the number of local samples. In the first row, there is no malicious participant, but clients have varying data set sizes. Therefore, the accuracy differences between vanilla and simple aggregation can be considered as the impact of size differences, and the impact can be as high as <math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3.1\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">3.1</mn><mo id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">3.1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">3.1\%</annotation></semantics></math> in the final accuracy.

Since the only difference in the two settings is the additional 3 malicious participants, we conclude that the effect of having participants with varying sample sizes can be as harmful as having at least 3 malicious participants. From the table, we also notice that softmax aggregation is the only method that has final accuracy between vanilla and simple aggregation, indicating it is capable of handling clients with varying sample sizes. We also conclude that softmax aggregation performs well when no malicious clients are present.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude, in this paper we propose a new BCFL scheme and a softmax aggregation technique designed specifically for the proposed architecture. The reliance on existing blockchain networks ensures the participation rewards are universal and liquid. Softmax aggregation utilizes the architecture’s approximated population loss to calculate the weights assigned to the workers’ models. It does not assume honest validators and empirically we show that the aggregation technique is robust even when having up to half colluding malicious validators. Additionally, under mild assumptions we prove the convergence property of softmax aggregation. We also explore the less studied case when participants have samples of varying sizes. The results show it is a serious threat to existing FL schemes, specifically, the impact of varying data set sizes can be more severe than having <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="15\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">15</mn><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">15</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">15\%</annotation></semantics></math> malicious clients and existing robust aggregation methods do not perform well in these scenarios. We also research other robustness measures using different experimental settings and show that the softmax aggregation technique is by far the most robust, without compromising privacy and the decentralization assumptions of BCFL frameworks.</p>

Complete Results ‣ Appendix ‣ Robust softmax aggregation on blockchain based federated learning with convergence guarantee" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> contains the results from all experiments and aggregation methods. The results are consistent with other results, specifically, the softmax aggregation method is the most robust in varying situations. It either is the best performer or has similar accuracy to the best aggregation method. It is also worth noting again that the vanilla aggregation method, which performs well in a few tasks, utilizes private sample size information that is beneficial to the performance, and ignoring the vanilla method, softmax aggregation is the best performer in 13 out of the 16 tasks.</p>
