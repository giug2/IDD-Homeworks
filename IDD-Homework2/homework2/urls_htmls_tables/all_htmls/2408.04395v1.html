<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">Blogs and social networking sites serve as a platform to the users for expressing their interests, ideas and thoughts. Targeted marketing uses the recommendation systems for suggesting their services and products to the users or clients. So the method used by target marketing is extraction of keywords and main topics from the user generated texts. Most of conventional methods involve identifying the personal interests just on the basis of surveys and rating systems. But the proposed research differs in manner that it aim at using the user generated text as a source medium for identifying and analyzing the personal interest as a knowledge base area of users. Semantic graph based approach is proposed research work that identifies the references of clients and users by analyzing their own texts such as tweets. The keywords need to be extracted from the text generated by the user on the social networking sites. This can be made possible by using several algorithms that extracts the keywords automatically from the
available content provided by the user. Based on frequency and degree it ranks the extracted keywords. Furthermore, semantic graph based model assists in providing useful suggestions just by extracting the interests of users by analyzing their contents from social media. In this approach graph comprises of nodes and edges where nodes represents the keywords extracted by
the algorithm and edges shows the semantic connection between the nodes. The method does not require internet related user activities like surveys or ratings to gather user interest related information.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">In the current era, the use of internet is increasing more rapidly as the amount and complexity of information and web documents processed on internet are growing day by day. So, it becomes difficult for user to extract the useful information from huge source of web content. Filtering is required for efficient information retrieval. For searching the documents from web search engines or extracting any useful information from documents, or social sites keywords are preferred as they assist in summarizing the concept of document. But in the current era, the semantics technology is considered to be the advanced version that gives relevant results according to the queries and preferences of the users. The intention of the semantic based search is to prioritize the search results based on the semantics of the query and the content. They retrieve efficient results and save the user time and improve the efficiency of system. The use of social networking sites is rapidly increasing and the customers and companies can used it as a platform for interaction. Users may share their common interests using social sites. The significant results according to the preferences of users from social platforms can be achieved and gathered by analyzing the content of ideas expressed by the user on their social sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">The problem area is that the system must provide the information regarding the personal interest of users. Currently, researchers are concentrating much more on the recommending and rating systems as well as on personal service systems. There are wide ranges of mini-blogs, shopping, music, movies, and news related sites that recommend their products and updates to the users. For business purposes the use of social networking sites are tremendously evolving. All of the restaurants, hotels gain the popularity through recommendation and personalized systems. Most of the systems recommend their products or services based on their previous search history and purchased items history. But the problem or question arise is that either the system is providing the knowledge related to the users interest or according to their own considerations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">Most of the existing recommending systems suggest useless services to the users just because of their poor knowledge area. Self-interest of end-user is essential requirement for any good recommending system and for that purpose the knowledge about users interests is required. Traditional systems emphasize on gathering the information by surveys, ratings, and tracking users behavior and they are not concerned with the text or content the user shares or updates on their social sites or blogs. The proposed research is concerned with identifying the areas that are of users interest. For extracting the topic related to users interest multi-purpose automatic topic
indexing algorithm is suitable. A social connection serves as a key concept that assists in extracting user interest from social networks. Graphs are used in which users are shown with nodes and edges represent the connection between the users. But considering the semantic similarity of edges is mandatory and useful concept for semantic based search. To generate user interest graph the proposed technique here is semantic graph based approach. The main contributions are as follow:</p>

semantic graph generation on the basis of users interest.
By analyzing the content of users tweet the preferences
are gathered. Product based graph is also generated and
by matching the user interests graph and product graph the
outcomes are predicted according to the users preferences.
The algorithm used for keyword extraction in this approach
is RAKE and the DBpedia is used for Wikipedia links. W. Yuezhong, et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.04395v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite> presented the technique for obtaining
high quality data according to users preferences from huge
source of information. In this approach user interest model
is combined with ontology semantic tree and vector space
model. For updating the users interest forgetting function
is used. The architecture of user interest model based on
VSM and ontology comprises of three layers: input layer,
processing layer and output layer. The input layer is primarily
concerned with data acquisition; processing layer is concerned with preprocessing and data processing mechanisms
whereas the output layer represents the user interest model.
A. Akay et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.04395v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite> presented weighted network model and

the opinions or reviews given by the users about the products
feature. For rating the features of product sentiment analysis
is performed and the domain ontology is used to accumulate
the opinions embedded with product feature description.
Basically the model has three main phases. In first step
domain ontology is created and then the relevant reviews
are extracted from twitter. Finally sentiment analysis needs
to be performed. The technique
for extracting the keywords by using the graph based model
comprised of nodes and edges was also studied. Nodes contain the documents
and edges represent the relationship that exists between the
words of documents. S. Adalbjornsson et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.04395v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite> presented

items by observing the consumption behavior of users as well

Mutual Information (PMI) and Explicit Semantic Analysis
(ESA) as approaches for topic matching matrix to figure
out semantic relatedness for cross domain recommendations.
Based on the reviews and comments of users recommendations and decisions are suggested. The proposed approach
shows better precision for cross domain recommendation as
it involves semantic relatedness then the cosine similarity
measure which only incorporate topic matching. C.H. Tsai

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS2.p3.1">Maui serves as pre-processing phase for extraction of keywords from the texts such as tweets. Pre-processing involves
replacing the name of users with real names according to the
screen name as in this way certain ids are allotted to the user.
Zemanta API is used and it includes the links to DBpedia and
provides more accuracy so used in the proposed approach.
Zemanta is concerned with identifying entity from the
users tweet. Inside it is DBpedia that extracts the wikipeida
information. The next phase is keywords filtration, all of the
extracted keywords are checked in Zemanta API and DBpedia that if there exists certain entry related to that keyword or
not. If not then the keywords are removed because they will
not be useful for semantic graph generation. Certain short
descriptions related to list of keywords are added by checking
their corresponding entry in DBpedia inside Zemanta API.
The next phase is user interest graph generator based on
the semantics. The extracted keywords are used as nodes
of graph and the connection between nodes is represented
as edges. The edge is drawn between semantically similar
nodes.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.SS2.p4.1">The sentiment analysis of the generated users interest
is then performed by using the SNLP tool. In this phase
opinion score is determined based on three measures positive,
negative and objective. Positive score shows the positive
behavior of word, negative score shows the negative and
objective depicts less subjective behavior of word. Product
graphs are generated from the category of available products
and then product graph matching is performed with the
user interest graph based on their semantics and finally the
outcome shows that the product graphs that relate more to
the users interest are more strongly semantically connected
to the users graph. Connection strength is determined by the
weights that the node possesses. The weights are assigned
to each of the node according to the number of connections
it has with the adjacent node.</p>
