<p id="id19.id1" class="ltx_p">Although Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) utilizes edge servers (ESs) to alleviate communication burdens, its model performance will be degraded by non-IID data and limited communication resources. Current works often assume that data is uniformly distributed, which however contradicts the heterogeneity of IoT. Solutions of additional model training to check the data distribution inevitably increases computational costs and the risk of privacy leakage. The challenges in solving these issues are how to reduce the impact of non-IID data without involving raw data and how to rationalize the communication resource allocation for addressing straggler problem. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel optimization method based on coa<span id="id19.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>ition formation gam<span id="id19.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">E</span> and gr<span id="id19.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>dient <span id="id19.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">P</span>rojection, called LEAP. Specifically, we combine edge data distribution with coalition formation game innovatively to adjust the correlations between clients and ESs dynamically, which ensures optimal correlations. We further capture the client heterogeneity to achieve the rational bandwidth allocation from coalition perception and determine the optimal transmission power within specified delay constraints at client level. Experimental results on four real datasets show that LEAP is able to achieve 20.62% improvement in model accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, LEAP effectively reduce transmission energy consumption by at least about 2.24 times.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a novel distributed machine learning paradigm, FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> has gained the attention of many fields, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Rahman <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, smart transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pandya <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, and healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, to break down the information silos while enabling privacy preservation. With the power of FL, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can effectively handle machine learning tasks involving decentralized data, which draws upon the advantages of distribution machine learning, while also significantly eliminates the privacy risks. During the training process, only model parameters are transmitted without involving local data, breaking information silos and greatly improving training efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. However, FL performance is affected by various factors, both in the training and transmission phases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. During the training phase, FL involves hundreds and thousands of clients, and the data distribution of each client is severely different due to diverse user behavior patterns and data collection methods. Consequently, the local data of an individual client fails to represent the overall data distribution of the environment, leading to significant reductions in model performance, compromising the model’s generalization capability. In the transmission phase, there is high communication latency and instability between clients and central server (CS) by mass and frequent data transfers, reducing model training efficiency and even increasing the risk of data leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, numerous solutions have been proposed to address data heterogeneity and communication bottlenecks. For a FL task, client’s data distribution is very important to the performance of FL model. When the data distribution of each client deviates seriously, the FL model is difficult to learn and its performance is low. For example, non-IID data causes a number of FL model performance issues, including decreased accuracy, sluggish model convergence, and model communication delays. Reinforcement learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xia <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Chen <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> were proposed to address the non-IID challenges. These studies overemphasize the importance of individual clients, ignoring the performance improvement of the model benefited from the combination of local updates. In addition, despite their significance, most of these approaches, require auxiliary models or extra data transmissions in FL, potentially introducing additional complexities. To alleviate communication pressures, various techniques such as model compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, gradient sparsity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lin <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, and over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">An <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> were proposed. Although these methods can effectively reduce communication overhead, they may still result in bottlenecks in communication at the CS each communication round. This is due to the fact that during some training epochs, the CS still receives large model weight updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, we try to reduce the impact of non-IID distribution on HFL training by increasing the degree of IID of data distribution between ESs. Additionally, we would like to further optimize the resource allocation scheme, thus reducing the communication latency. The combination of these two objectives gives rise to an extremely complex and difficult problem, which leads to the following three challenges: First, <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">different edge association relationships represent different edge data distribution.</span> Once edge association changes, the data distribution will evolve in an unpredictable direction, potentially reducing or increasing the degree of edge IID. Therefore, the impact of changes in association relationships on changes in data distribution is vague and uncertain. Second, <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">straggler problem caused by worst-performing client.</span> Edge aggregation latency is susceptible to the communication performance of the worst-performing client in synchronized FL. Dynamic edge association relationships make it difficult to capture communication performance information for each edge coalition. As a result, targeted resource optimization is impossible. Third, <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">contradiction between task execution latency requirements and clients’ energy consumption.</span> Sufficient resource investment can meet the task requirements but may cause excessive overhead on clients, which is impractical. Consequently, striking a balance that satisfies the needs of both parties simultaneously poses a formidable challenge.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Non-IID Data.</span> In FL, the non-IID data, caused by the heterogeneity among clients, poses a challenge for training robust FL models due to its impact on slowing down the convergence of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yao <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Many efforts have been made to address this issue. For instance, Arisdakessian <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Arisdakessian <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> proposed a trust-based coalitional FL approach, which mitigates non-IID problems by sharing data of coalition masters. Lu <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> utilizes the mean-shift algorithm to cluster client according to data distribution and then selects clients from different clusters to participate in training. Shin <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shin <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposed a novel approach that uses XorMixup hybrid data enhancement technology to generate synthetic yet realistic sample data on the server to solve the issue of unbalanced training datasets in one-shot FL, but this approach will bring a large computational burden.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Data-sharing operation raises privacy concerns for clients, thus limiting its application scenarios and it is difficult to operate under privacy-preserving FL. The method of selecting clients through clustering does mitigate the non-IID problem, but it does not guarantee that the final selection result is optimal. In contrast, our work can find optimal edge association relationship in no additional model training without considering the raw data leakage problem.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Communication Bottleneck.</span> In FL, communication cost is a significant factor that affects overall efficiency and effectiveness, while the uplink transmission rate of the underlying client is a major bottleneck in the training process. Many researchers proposed related solutions. For example, Mills <span id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mills <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> focused on enhancing communication efficiency in FL by combining a distributed Adam optimizer with a compression technique. They emphasized reducing the uploaded data size during training rounds to mitigate communication costs. Building upon of model compression, Liu <span id="S2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> applied it to wireless FL to alleviate local computation and communication bottlenecks.</p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The abovementioned studies were conducted on cloud-based FL systems, whereby the CS receives the local model from the clients.

Comparing the initial state, the average accuracy based on the final distribution is improved by 2.9%, 33.3%, 47.6%, and 26.2% in the four datasets, respectively. Based on the same initial conditions, Mean-shift algorithm divides the data into five clusters. While randomly assigning the clients to ESs, the optimal client combination cannot be ensured because of the duplicate labels within the clusters. A similar issue arises when using the K-means algorithm. In addition, the K-means algorithm requires specifying the number of clusters in advance, which further hampers its applicability. It is clear that the final result after optimization based on our method is significantly improved compared to the other two methods, because our method is always in the direction of better when adjusting the combination of data distribution.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, a novel optimization method LEAP, which has a lightweight implementation, was proposed to address the impact of muti-dimentional properties on HFL, i.e., data contribution, consumption of time and energy. Due to the stochastic nature of data distribution under ESs, edge association was combined with LEAP and a coalition formation game was built to model data distribution under different associations. To reduce the degree of non-IID of cross-edge data, coalition-friendly preference rule was employed, and the existence of stable coalition partitions was proved. Further, the gradient projection method (GP) was utilized to reduce task execution time in heterogeneous resources within stable coalitions, improving the communication efficiency. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on various real datasets to validated the effectiveness of LEAP.</p>

<p id="Ax1.SSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, Fig. <a href="#Ax1.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ Supplement of Table 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows the differences between the data distributions of different methods and the initial distribution. Fig. <a href="#Ax1.F5.sf1" title="Figure 5(a) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ Supplement of Table 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a> shows the initial distribution of RH and our method before adjusting data distribution. Since the MA method does not involve the adjustment of data distribution, the state in Fig. <a href="#Ax1.F5.sf2" title="Figure 5(b) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ Supplement of Table 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a> is same as that in Fig. <a href="#Ax1.F5.sf1" title="Figure 5(a) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ Supplement of Table 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a>. In Fig. <a href="#Ax1.F5.sf3" title="Figure 5(c) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ Supplement of Table 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(c)</span></a>, the final data distribution of RH is different from the initial state. The main reason behind this phenomenon is that the RH does not perform coalition formation to optimize the data distribution. In contrast, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ax1.F5.sf4" title="Figure 5(d) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ Supplement of Table 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(d)</span></a>, our results indicate that the data label distributions obtained by each coalition are ultimately the most similar.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ax1.SSx3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ax1.SSx3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Then, we give the results on four datasets based on the data distribution in Fig. <a href="#Ax1.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ Supplement of Table 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The results on the four datasets show that the distribution adjusted by our proposed method LEAP consistently yields optimal accuracy compared to RH and MA, with specific improvements of 10.75% on the MNIST dataset, 22.23% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, 20.7% on the SVHN dataset, and 15.85% on the CINIC-10 dataset, respectively. The main reason behind this phenomenon is that RA performs association formation with a selfish client preference rule without considering the impact on the coalition partition and data distribution, and MA discards some model parameters that fall below the loss threshold when performing aggregation based on marginal losses, resulting in data wasting. In contrast, LEAP performs coalition formation to achieve optimal data distribution among ESs to improve model performance without wasting data. It is worth noting that the average accuracy in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> of the submission file is calculated by summing the data on the corresponding fold in Fig. <a href="#Ax1.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ Supplement of Table 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> and then dividing it by the number of global rounds.</p>
