<p id="id16.id1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML), driven by prominent paradigms such as centralized and federated learning, has made significant progress in various critical applications ranging from autonomous driving to face recognition.
However, its remarkable success has been accompanied by various attacks.
Recently, the model hijacking attack has shown that ML models can be hijacked to execute tasks different from their original tasks, which increases both accountability and parasitic computational risks.</p>
<p id="id17.id2" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, thus far, this attack has only focused on centralized learning.
In this work, we broaden the scope of this attack to the federated learning domain, where multiple clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing their data.
Specifically, we present <span id="id17.id2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HijackFL</span>, the first-of-its-kind hijacking attack against the global model in federated learning.
The adversary aims to force the global model to perform a different task (called hijacking task) from its original task without the server or benign client noticing.
To accomplish this, unlike existing methods that use data poisoning to modify the target model’s parameters, HijackFL searches for pixel-level perturbations based on their local model (without modifications) to align hijacking samples with the original ones in the feature space.
When performing the hijacking task, the adversary applies these cloaks to the hijacking samples, compelling the global model to identify them as original samples and predict them accordingly.
We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three popular models.
Empirical results demonstrate that its attack performance outperforms baselines.
We further investigate the factors that affect its performance and discuss possible defenses to mitigate its impact.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;"> Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) has progressed rapidly in the past decade.
Centralized learning and federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, as the two most representative paradigms, have played a crucial role in this advancement.
In centralized learning, ML models are trained on a central server where the training data are centrally gathered.
In contrast, federated learning enables collaborative training across multiple decentralized devices, ensuring local privacy and data ownership.
These approaches have led to unprecedented achievements of ML in various applications, such as image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, healthcare diagnostics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and authentication systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite being popular, ML models are vulnerable to a range of security and privacy attacks.
For instance, the adversary can craft a malicious dataset to train the target model for various malicious purposes.
Such attacks are commonly known as training time attacks, i.e., attacks that interfere with the training process of the target model.
Backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> are two of the most popular training time attacks.
In backdoor attacks, the adversary manipulates the target model to produce malicious output when facing any input that contains specific triggers, while behaving normally on clean data.
In contrast, poisoning attacks try to jeopardize the model’s utility performance on clean data.
Both attacks have been demonstrated across centralized learning and federated learning.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on a new type of attack, the model hijacking attack, where the adversary aims to force the target model to perform a completely different task, known as the hijacking task.
For instance, the target model is designed for the CIFAR-10 task, while an adversary aims to repurpose it for a different task, such as MNIST.
Successful model hijacking attacks can cause severe consequences.
The first is about accountability, in which the model owner can unknowingly be held responsible for unintended and potentially illegal or unethical services.
Another significant risk is parasitic computing, where the model owner pays for model maintenance and training while the adversary utilizes it for free or for its own purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In NDSS’22, Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> presented the first model hijacking attack against machine learning models, or more precisely, centralized learning models.
As the data provider, the adversary can manipulate the target model’s training dataset by integrating the hijacking dataset into the original one, i.e., the data poisoning approach.
Consequently, models trained on such a modified dataset will have their parameters altered, leading to a change in their behavior.
Si et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> also utilize the data poisoning approach to hijack NLP models.
However, the data poisoning approach used in both Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and Si et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> is only applicable to centralized learning models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Motivation.</span> In this study, we consider the model hijacking attack in the federated learning paradigm.
We exclusively focus on federated learning in the image domain.
As depicted in <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 1</span></a>, the adversary, acting as a malicious client, attempts to repurpose the global model intended for the original task (e.g., CIFAR 10) to perform the hijacking task (e.g., MNIST).
Intuitively, two unique characteristics of federated learning hinder existing model hijacking attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
First, federated learning enables multiple participants to train a global model collaboratively.
This collaborative characteristic implies that a malicious client may only participate in a few training rounds to submit their modified model parameters to the server.
In most training rounds, only benign local model parameters are submitted to the global model.
This results in a high probability of the hijacking effect being diminished or eliminated.
Second, modified local model parameters submitted by the adversary may differ from benign model ones, which can be detected by the central server.
Our experiments (see <a href="#S5.SS1" title="Attack Performance ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section 5.1</span></a>) confirm the aforementioned: the adversary cannot implant the hijacking in the FL domain using the data poisoning approach.
To overcome these limitations, we make the first attempt to answer, “Is it possible to hijack a cooperatively trained global model without relying on any modifications to it?”</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our Contributions.</span> In this paper, we introduce the first model hijacking attack against the global model in the FL domain, called HijackFL.
Specifically, HijackFL achieves the goal of hijacking by adding pixel-level perturbations, referred to as “cloaks,” into the hijacking samples.
Using the local model as a foundation, the adversary optimizes these cloaks to ensure that the hijacking samples closely resemble the original samples within the feature space.
Once the cloaks are optimized, the local model can identify hijacking samples with added cloaks as original samples, thus predicting them to the original classes according to the adversary’s predetermined class mapping.
Furthermore, due to the high similarity between the local and global models, these cloaks will exhibit a high degree of transferability, thus allowing the global model to accurately classify hijacking samples with added cloaks.
Since the adversary does not modify their local model but only submits benign local model parameters to the server, HijackFL successfully addresses the challenges faced by existing attack methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct extensive evaluations using four benchmark computer vision datasets and three widely used models.
Empirical results demonstrate that HijackFL has no side effect in the utility of the global model and, furthermore, outperforms existing attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
For instance, when the global model is ResNet-18, and the original dataset is CIFAR-10, HijackFL can achieve an attack success rate of 92.75% for the MNIST hijacking dataset.
In contrast, the existing attacks only achieve an attack success rate of around 10%.
Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze the factors that may affect the attack performance and also explore two possible defenses to mitigate our attack.</p>

Basically, FL can be divided into two kinds, depending on how the training data is split among clients.
The most common setting is known as horizontal FL, with the training data instances being split across the sample space.
That is, each client hosts different training data instances sharing the same features.
Another FL setting is vertical FL, where each client hosts the same training data instances but owns different and non-overlapping features.
In this work, we only consider the most common setting – horizontal FL (briefly called FL throughout this paper).</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_font_bold ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;"> Model Hijacking Attack</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Model hijacking attack is a new class of training time attacks against ML models.
In centralized learning, Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> assume the adversary acts as a data provider and follows a similar implementation as data poisoning attacks, i.e., poisoning the training dataset to modify the target model’s parameters.
Two attack methods are proposed in Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
The first is to directly mix the original dataset with the hijacking dataset.
This achieves the upper bound on attack performance yet causes a drawback: it can be detected by the model owner as the original and hijacking datasets are visually different.
Thus, Salem et al. introduce an extra model to transform the hijacking dataset into a format visually similar to the original dataset.
Subsequently, Si et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> presented an attack similar to the second one mentioned above, but targeting NLP models.
Both studies demonstrate the applicability of the model hijacking attack to the centralized learning domain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Note.</span> It is important to note that model hijacking differs from data poisoning and backdooring.
Data poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> aims to <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">jeopardize the models’ utility</span>, and backdooring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> links <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the trigger inserted in the original sample</span> (e.g., a white square at the corner) to specific model output.
Though the backdoor attack can be considered a specific instance of model hijacking to some extent, hijacking a model is to execute <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">an entirely different task</span>, regardless of the original one.
This implies that achieving the hijacking objective is more challenging.
Further, the adversary is free to determine the hijacking task in the hijacking attack.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">ML models are trained to extract and identify features from input samples, which they employ for prediction. However, their feature identification can be misled by adversarial example attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, where slight perturbations to input samples alter the model’s feature perception.
Our attack exploits this vulnerability to mislead the global model’s perception of features extracted from hijacking samples toward the original samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">During FL training, the adversary updates their local models by fetching the global model from the central server.
Leveraging the local model, the adversary then learns slight perturbations (called cloaks) for the hijacking samples, enabling the local model to extract features close to those from the original samples.
If the global model remains relatively stable in subsequent training rounds, the cloaks learned on the local model can be transferred to the global model.
This transferability enables the global model to also extract features from the hijacking samples that are similar to the original samples.
The global model thinks it works correctly, as it perceives the features of input samples within the “original dataset.”
Through this process, the adversary successfully accomplishes the goal of hijacking the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We illustrate this in <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Methodology ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 2</span></a> using a simplified 2D visualization of the feature space.
As depicted in <a href="#S3.F2.sf1" title="2(a) ‣ Figure 2 ‣ Methodology ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a>, the decision boundary represents the local/global model trained on the original dataset, but it fails to distinctly classify the hijacking samples into separate regions.
However, after adding the cloaks, the hijacking samples will become clearly separable into different regions (<a href="#S3.F2.sf2" title="2(b) ‣ Figure 2 ‣ Methodology ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>), enabling accurate predictions by the model.
We emphasize that the adversary does not modify the local model, but only the hijacking sample by adding cloaks.
Thus, the adversary exchanges only clean model parameters with the server, just like a benign client.
This prevents the two challenges of modifying local model parameters via poisoning training datasets: (1) being detected by the server and (2) the hijacking effect being removed.</p>

When generating cloaks for a hijacking task, the adversary will create class-specific cloaks based on their held hijacking dataset, i.e., <math id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\delta" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">δ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝛿</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p6.1.m1.1c">\delta</annotation></semantics></math> is class-dependent.
Specifically, depending on the held hijacking dataset, the adversary optimizes the cloak for a particular hijacking class; therefore, samples within this class can be extracted to the same or similar features.
This ensures that the cloak exhibits a high degree of generalizability, allowing it to map new, unseen real-world hijacked samples from that class to similar features, thus predicting them to the same original class.
Therefore, instead of producing individual cloaks for each hijacking sample, we propose creating a single, generalizable cloak for each hijacking class.

The adversary can now execute the attack on the remotely deployed global model.
Given a new hijacking sample, the adversary cannot directly determine which cloak should be added to this sample.
Instead, as shown in <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ Datasets ‣ Experimental Setup ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 6</span></a>, the adversary obtains 3 cloaked samples by adding 3 cloaks to the given sample respectively.
The adversary then queries the global mode for each cloaked sample to obtain its 4-dimensional probability.
The adversary observes only the first 3 dimensions of the probability, and selects the class with the highest probability as the final prediction,
Finally, the adversary can determine its hijacking class by reversing the class mapping <math id="S3.SS3.p8.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\textit{M}^{-}}(\cdot)=[0\Rightarrow 0,3\Rightarrow

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate HijackFL, we employ four well-established computer vision benchmark datasets: MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, GTSRB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and TinyImageNet-100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Here’s a brief introduction to each dataset:</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MNIST.</span> MNIST is a gray image dataset consisting of handwritten digits. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each image representing a single digit from 0 to 9.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CIFAR-10.</span> CIFAR-10 is a dataset comprising 60,000 color images divided into 10 classes. Each image in CIFAR-10 belongs to one of the following categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GTSRB.</span> GTSRB is an image collection consisting of 43 traffic signs.
It consists of over 51,839 color images, with 39,209 used for training and 12,630 used for testing.
Due to the high imbalance of each class, we select the top ten classes with the highest number of samples to create a more balanced dataset.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">TinyImageNet-100.</span> TinyImageNet-100 is a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, containing 100 object classes with 500 training images and 50 validation images per class.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We use CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet-100 as the original datasets, while MNIST and GTSRB are the hijacking datasets.
The different combinations of these datasets and dataset sizes are presented in <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Federated Learning Settings ‣ Experimental Setup ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table 1</span></a> and <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Federated Learning Settings ‣ Experimental Setup ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table 2</span></a>.
Since the last original class should be fixed for negative pairs, when the original dataset is CIFAR-10, we randomly sample 9 classes from MNIST and GTSRB as the hijacking dataset.
This is actually an inherent limitation of the model hijacking attack, i.e., the original dataset should have more class labels than the hijacking dataset.
We will discuss this further in <a href="#S6.SS2" title="Limitation ‣ Discussion ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section 6.2</span></a>.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As aforementioned, we focus on the machine learning classification setting in this work.
Thus, following Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, we also use the popular image classification model as our target model, namely ResNet-18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, MobileNet-V2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and ShuffleNet-V2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Each of these model architectures enjoys its own unique property and has been applied in a wide range of applications.

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing model hijacking attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> aim to hijack centralized ML models to perform different tasks.
The core idea of existing work is to utilize data poisoning to achieve the goal of hijacking.
We generalize this data poisoning approach to the federated learning setting as a baseline attack.
In addition, we consider adapting the data poisoning approach to model poisoning based on the idea of backdooring the FL model proposed by Bagdasaryan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Data Poisoning.</span>
The adversary can poison the training dataset, achieving the goal of hijacking when the model is trained on this poisoned data.
Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and Si et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> employ this method.
Specifically, Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> introduce two attack methods.
The first involves mixing the original dataset with the hijacking dataset and then using this poisoned dataset to train the target model.
This achieves the upper bound on attack performance yet causes a drawback: it can be easily detected by the model owner since samples in the original and the hijacking datasets can be significantly different.
Thus, Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> introduce an additional model to transform the hijacking dataset into one that is visually similar to the original dataset, which is then mixed with the original dataset to train the target model.
Si et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> adopt a similar approach by using an additional model to transform the hijacking dataset.
In this study, we apply both of these methods to the FL scenario, called <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Data Poison (naive)</span> and <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Data Poison (transform)</span>.
We emphasize that both methods are essentially data poisoning attacks aimed at altering the target model’s parameters, while our attack avoids such modifications.</p>

This approach exploits the fact that federated learning gives malicious clients direct influence over the global model, enabling significantly more powerful attacks than data poisoning.

In this work, we adapt the two aforementioned data poisoning methods to model poisoning, called <span id="S4.SS5.p3.9.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Model Poison (naive)</span> and <span id="S4.SS5.p3.9.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Model Poison (transform)</span>.
Specifically, we scale up the adversary’s submitted model parameters to survive the averaging.
We make a strong assumption for the adversary that they know the exact FL settings, i.e., <math id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n=50" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.2.cmml">n</mi><mo id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.3.cmml">50</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1b"><apply id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.2">𝑛</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1.1.3">50</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS5.p3.7.m4.1c">n=50</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\eta=10" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1" xref="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.2.cmml">η</mi><mo id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1b"><apply id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.2">𝜂</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1.1.3">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS5.p3.8.m5.1c">\eta=10</annotation></semantics></math>.

To evaluate the utility, we first train a clean global model by initializing the federated learning training process using only the original training dataset.

This original testing dataset is sourced from the same distribution as the original training dataset.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Utility.</span>
We start by evaluating the utility of the hijacked global model on the original testing dataset.
<a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Baseline Attacks ‣ Experimental Setup ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table 3</span></a> illustrates the utility of both the hijacked global models and the clean ones trained solely with original datasets.
We observe that data poisoning (naive) and model poisoning (naive) induce slight side effects on the global model’s utility to different degrees.
For instance, clean ResNet-18 achieves 88.03% utility on TaskSet-I, while hijacked ResNet-18 achieves 86.39% utility by model poison (naive).
Conversely, data poison (transform), and particularly model poison (transform), exhibit a more significant negative impact on the global model’s utility.
For example, on TaskSet-III, clean MobileNet-V2 achieves 44.72% utility, whereas hijacked MobileNet-V2 achieves 38.84% and 29.94% utility by data poison (transform) and model poison (transform), respectively.
These findings align with those of Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, where transforming the hijacking dataset leads to relatively poorer performance.
We attribute these observations to the fact that transforming the hijacking dataset visually aligns it more closely with the original dataset, thereby complicating model optimization and resulting in decreased utility.
In particular, since the model poison further amplifies poisoned local model parameters by the scale-up <math id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\gamma=\frac{n}{\eta}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">γ</mi><mo id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mfrac id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">n</mi><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">η</mi></mfrac></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝛾</ci><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><divide id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"></divide><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑛</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝜂</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\gamma=\frac{n}{\eta}</annotation></semantics></math>, it leads to a particularly obvious decrease in utility.</p>

We also compare our attack with the baseline attacks of data poison and model poison.
We present the results in <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Evaluation Metrics ‣ Experimental Setup ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 7</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As we can see, HijackFL achieves a very high level of attack success rate and is far superior to baseline attacks.
For example, on ResNet-18, our attack for TaskSet-I achieves an attack success rate of 92.75%, while all baseline attacks achieve only around 10%.
The reason behind this is that the baseline attacks achieve their goal by submitting poisoned model parameters, thereby injecting the hijacking effect into the global model. However, as the global model undergoes more FL training rounds and averages only benign local model parameters, the hijacking effect will be reduced or even removed.
However, since HijackFL does not rely on injecting the hijacking effect into the global model, it has a high probability of achieving remarkable attack performance even as the global model undergoes more FL training rounds.</p>

We can observe a noticeable fluctuation in utility when baseline attacks execute the poison operation.
Such fluctuations can easily alert the server, leading to detection by the central server.
This observation stems from the fact that baseline attacks modify local model parameters, which are then transmitted to the central server.
Consequently, the global model is affected, resulting in decreased accuracy on the original dataset.
In subsequent rounds, when only benign local model parameters are submitted to the central server, the adversary’s hijacking impact is eliminated.
As a result, utility levels rebound to a high standard.
This also explains why these baseline attacks only achieve a 5% <math id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math> 22% attack success rate when targeting the final global model, as depicted in <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Evaluation Metrics ‣ Experimental Setup ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 7</span></a>.
In contrast, in HijackFL, the adversary simply trains the local model on their original dataset as usual and submits these clean model parameters to the server.
As a result, the adversary can always guarantee the utility of the global model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Concretely, in TaskSet-I, where CIFAR-10 is the original dataset, and MNIST is the hijacking dataset, we randomly select some hijacking samples from a single hijacking class and an equivalent number of original samples from its mapped original class.
We feed these samples into the final global model and extract features from the middle layer of the model (i.e., <math id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Phi" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Φ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">Φ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">\Phi</annotation></semantics></math> without the model classification layer).
Then, we utilize t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> to process these features into a 2D space and visualize them in <a href="#S5.F9.sf1" title="9(a) ‣ Figure 9 ‣ Feature Visualization ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(a)</span></a>.

<div id="S5.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recall that our attack consists of four steps, where the first stage is class mapping. In this stage, the adversary predefines a class mapping between the hijacking class and the original class.
Since we believe that the hijacking samples of certain classes will be more inclined to be associated with a certain original class.
Therefore, we introduce a greedy-based class mapping to facilitate the optimization of effective cloaks.
In this section, we investigate the impact of the class mapping on the attack performance, i.e., whether it is really as we conjectured.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, we discard our proposed greedy-based class mapping strategy and instead assign the first several original classes to the hijacking classes in a one-to-one mapping, similar to the strategy adopted by Salem et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
For example, in TaskSet-III, where TinyImageNet-100 serves as the original
dataset and MNIST as the hijacking dataset, so we directly assign the first 10 classes of TinyImageNet-100 to the 10 classes of MNIST in a one-to-one mapping (called direct mapping).
We then keep our (HijackFL) other settings unchanged and evaluate its attack performance.
<a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ Feature Visualization ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 10</span></a> shows a comparison of HijackFL with greedy-based class mapping and direct class mapping.
We can find that in most cases, greedy-based class mapping outperforms direct class mapping in terms of attack performance.
For example, in TaskSet-II on ResNet-18, the attack with greedy-based class mapping achieves an attack success rate of 75.45%, while the attack with direct class mapping achieves an attack success rate of only 43.85%.
However, we do find an exception where the direct mapping achieves a similar level of performance as greedy-based attacks in TaskSet-III on ResNet-18.
We attribute this to the fact that the hijacking samples of the first few classes are already more inclined to be associated with the first few original classes.
Thus, the direct class mapping also achieves a similar attack performance as the greedy-based class mapping.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the above results show that the greedy-based class mapping we designed has excellent performance, and also verify our claim that hijacking samples of certain classes will indeed be more inclined to be associated with a certain original class.</p>

</div>
<div id="S5.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The underlying reason is that after the hijacking round, the global model undergoes further aggregation based on the submitted model updates in subsequent training rounds. This implies that the final global model differs from the one on which the adversary starts cloak computation. Such disparities impact the transferability of the cloaks. Starting cloak computation closer to the final training rounds, where the global model experiences minimal updates, allows the cloaked samples to be extracted to features similar to the original samples, resulting in a higher level of attack success rate.
In practical applications, the adversary can leverage its own original dataset to estimate the global model’s convergence status.
The adversary should initiate cloak computation when the global model has either converged or is close to convergence.</p>

We here study the impact of hijacking task complexity.
Specifically, we consider the hijacking task complexity from two perspectives: the number of classes and the number of samples per class. More concretely, for the original dataset TinyImageNet-100 and the hijacking dataset GTSRB, we reconstruct the GTSRB dataset by adjusting the number of classes from 2 to 10. Additionally, we vary the number of GTSRB samples per class within the range of 200 to 1000.
We conduct extensive experiments to simultaneously tune these two hyper-parameters and report the results in <a href="#S5.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ Ablation Study of Hyperparameters ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 12</span></a>.

<p id="S5.SS5.p4.2" class="ltx_p">The first observation is rooted in the fact that having more hijacking samples per class results in the learning of a more effective, general, and stable cloak, consequently leading to a higher attack performance.

We now discuss the impact of the number of hijacking tasks, which involves hijacking the global model with multiple datasets. Importantly, owing to our innovative design, HijackFL distinguishes itself by not interacting with the global model’s parameters, in contrast to the baseline attacks of data poison and model poison. Consequently, the adversary can initiate cloak computation based on the same global model, irrespective of the number of hijacking datasets. This approach enables the adversary to possess distinct sets of cloaks for different hijacking datasets, offering flexibility when launching attacks on the final global model as they can select the suitable set of cloaks.</p>

More hijacking datasets are likely to result in submitted model updates deviating further from a clean one, thereby causing a larger utility drop in the global model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p9.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS5.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Number of Cloak.</span> In our previous evaluations, we employ a single generalized cloak for all hijacking samples within the same class.
In this section, we explore the impact of the number of cloaks on attack performance.
In particular, we generate only one cloak for all hijacking samples, irrespective of their respective hijacking classes.
<a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Ablation Study of Hyperparameters ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table 4</span></a> shows evaluation results on ResNet-18 and MobileNet-V2 with all TaskSets.
We can clearly observe that employing just one cloak for the entire hijacking classes fails to effectively achieve the hijacking goal.
This outcome is understandable, as it becomes considerably more challenging for a single cloak to establish class mappings from various hijacking classes to various original classes compared to the simpler task of mapping one hijacking class to one original class.</p>

<div id="S5.SS5.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p10.1" class="ltx_p">We further consider the feasibility of generating a specific cloak for each hijacking sample.
We assert that this approach is impractical for several reasons.
Firstly, optimizing a cloak for each individual sample limits its effectiveness to that sample alone, rendering it ineffective for new, unseen hijacking instances.
Moreover, in hijacking datasets with numerous samples, generating a unique cloak for each becomes unwieldy for the adversary, making selection for new samples challenging.
Thus, adversaries should optimize cloaks based on a data domain (e.g., hijacking samples within the same class) with the aim of achieving generalizability.</p>

Note that this defense is specifically designed for a set of cloaked samples serving hijacking samples and has no side effects on the utility, so we do not report it.
We can see that this defense can substantially mitigate the attack.
However, it’s important to note that the adversary may not query a set of cloaked samples all at once; instead, they can intelligently query them at different times.
Furthermore, in the real world, the model is typically queried with mostly original samples, and interspersed among them are some cloaked samples.
Both of the above situations present significant challenges for this defense.
We leave the in-depth exploration of more effective defense mechanisms against our attack as a future work.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Adversarial Example Defenses.</span>
HijackFL adds cloaks to the hijacking samples, similar to adversarial examples that add slight pixel-level perturbations to input samples.
Therefore, a straightforward defense strategy is utilizing adversarial example defense.
Here, we employ a widely used adversarial example defense called Feature Squeezing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, which detects adversarial examples at the model prediction phase.
This defense is driven by the observation that the input spaces are often unnecessarily large, and this vast input space provides extensive opportunities for an adversary to construct adversarial examples.
Thus, the defender can “squeeze” out unnecessary input space to reduce the degrees of freedom available to an adversary.
The key idea is to compare the model’s prediction on the input sample with its prediction on the sample after squeezing.
If the input sample and squeezed samples produce substantially different outputs from the model, the input sample is likely to be adversarial.
By comparing the difference between predictions with a selected threshold, the defender can reject adversarial inputs.</p>

In particular, we examine two thresholds (see Appendix <a href="#A0.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ Model Hijacking Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table 8</span></a>), set significantly lower/higher, to increase sensitivity/insensitivity to input examples with added perturbations, respectively.
We find that a smaller threshold (Threshold 1) successfully detects hijacking samples but also yields a high rate of false positives when detecting original samples, resulting in a significant degradation of utility.
Conversely, with a higher threshold (Threshold 2), this defense fails to detect hijacking, leading to HijackFL still outperforming baseline attacks.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The limitation of our HijackFL lies in the constraint that the hijacking dataset cannot contain more classes than the original dataset. This restriction is prevalent across all existing studies on model hijacking attacks. In our evaluation, all hijacking datasets had fewer classes compared to their corresponding original datasets. For instance, when considering CIFAR-10 as the original dataset, the hijacking dataset derived from MNIST or GTSRB could only encompass a maximum of 9 classes.
The reason for this is that we need to reserve one original class to apply to all negative pairs, while there are only 9 original classes that can be assigned to the hijacking dataset.
We plan to explore more effective relabeling to address this limitation in future work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The second limitation is that the cloaked samples queried by the adversary to the global model may exhibit noticeable visual differences from the original samples, making them susceptible to detection by the defense mechanisms. One potential solution is to not only minimize the deviation of features between the cloaked samples and original samples but also minimize the deviation of pixels in the image space. This approach aims to make the hijacking samples, added with cloaks, resemble original samples in both image space and feature space. However, we speculate that introducing this additional objective for cloaks may diminish its overall effectiveness.
We will explore a more powerful attack against FL models to address this limitation.</p>

Unlike the model hijacking attack, which operates during the training phase, adversarial reprogramming is a test-time attack.
In this attack, the adversary optimizes a program that serves as the input to the target model, effectively tricking the model into performing a different task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">HijackFL and adversarial reprogramming are similar, involving the crafting of inputs by introducing perturbations to deceive the target model. However, adversarial reprogramming crafts perturbations based on the white-box access to the target model being attacked, which is unrealistic in the real world. In contrast, HijackFL initiates cloak computation based on an intermediate version of the global model and launches the attack against the final global model. Besides, the perturbation in HijackFL is class-dependent, meaning that hijacking samples of different classes use different perturbations. In contrast, adversarial reprogramming uses a universal perturbation for all samples of the hidden task. We also conducted tests on this method, and it demonstrated unacceptable attack performance (see “Number of Cloak”).</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The backdoor attack is typically associated with a specific trigger, such that when the trigger is present in any input sample, the target model predicts a predetermined label.
The first backdoor attack introduced in machine learning was BadNets by Gu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where a white square placed in the corner of an image served as the trigger to misclassify backdoored inputs.
Subsequent variations of the backdoor attack, such as dynamic backdoors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and Trojan attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, have been proposed to enhance the stealthiness and effectiveness of the attack.
Bagdasaryan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> have demonstrated that federated learning models are also susceptible to backdoor attacks.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present the first model hijacking attack against federated learning, namely HijackFL.
In this attack, an adversary (i.e., a malicious client) repurposes a global model designed for a specific task to perform an adversary-defined hijacking task.
The core design of HijackFL is to introduce pixel-level perturbations (cloaks) to hijacking samples, enabling their extraction and identification in a manner similar to the original samples within the feature space. Consequently, these samples are accurately classified into the corresponding original classes. We conduct extensive evaluations on four benchmark computer vision datasets and three widely used model architectures. Empirical findings demonstrate that our attack attains a high level of attack success rate without compromising model utility, meeting the two requirements for hijacking a federated learning model. Furthermore, we explore two possible defenses that can detect hijacking samples in the FL prediction phase.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our goal with this work is to first raise awareness of the accountability and parasitic computing risks that can be posed by hijacking attacks in the federated learning community.
We further discuss the potential defense mechanism with the aim of motivating the community to investigate different mitigation techniques to address these risks.</p>

<p id="A0.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A0.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Loss Function Convexity.</span>
The L2 loss function is a squared loss function.
Since the squared function is convex, the L2 loss function inherits this property.
Convex functions exhibit desirable optimization properties, ensuring that the optimal solution is globally optimal and avoids local minima.
This helps the optimization algorithm to converge to the global optimum.</p>

<div id="A0.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A0.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A0.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Gradient Continuity.</span>
This gradient is continuous because the derivative of the squared function is a linear function that can be derived everywhere.
The continuity of the gradient ensures that the gradient information is reliable in the process of finding the optimal solution of the optimization algorithm, and there will not be a situation where the gradient does not exist or is not continuous.</p>
</div>
<div id="A0.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A0.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A0.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Convergence.</span>
Since the L2 loss function is convex and the gradient is continuous, optimization algorithms based on gradient descent can converge to the global optimum.
The continuous gradient guides the optimization process toward the optimal solution along the descent direction until convergence.
Importantly, convexity prevents the algorithm from getting trapped in local optima.</p>
</div>
<div id="A0.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A0.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the L2 distance as a loss function has good mathematical properties, i.e., convexity and continuity of the gradient, which makes the optimization algorithm based on gradient descent able to converge to the global optimal solution.
This is one of the important reasons why the L2 loss function is widely used in machine learning and optimization problems.</p>
