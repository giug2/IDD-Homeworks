<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an evolving machine learning method in which multiple clients participate in collaborative learning without sharing their data with each other and the central server. In real-world applications such as hospitals and industries, FL counters the challenges of data heterogeneity and model heterogeneity as an inevitable part of the collaborative training. More specifically, different organizations, such as hospitals, have their own private data and customized models for local training. To the best of our knowledge, the existing methods do not effectively address both problems of model heterogeneity and data heterogeneity in FL. In this paper, we exploit the data and model heterogeneity simultaneously, and propose a method, MDH-FL (Exploiting Model and Data Heterogeneity in FL) to solve such problems to enhance the efficiency of the global model in FL. We use knowledge distillation and a symmetric loss to minimize the heterogeneity and its impact on the model performance. Knowledge distillation is used to solve the problem of model heterogeneity, and symmetric loss tackles with the data and label heterogeneity. We evaluate our method on the medical datasets to conform the real-world scenario of hospitals, and compare with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the other existing methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL), initially introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, has become a popular machine learning technique because of distributed model training without sharing the private data of participating hosts. In FL, participants (i.e., clients) including organizations and devices generally have heterogeneous data and heterogeneous models that are customized according to the tasks and local data. In real-world applications, data from multiple sources are heterogeneous and contain non-independent and identically and distributed data (non-IID). Moreover, data from multiple source may produce diverse labels and classes that is more challenging for the convergence of FL model. Traditional training methods based on centralized data cannot be used in practical applications due to privacy concerns and data silos at multiple locations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. FL has the ability to train a global model by allowing multiple participants to train collaboratively with their decentralized private data. In this way, private data of an individual participant are never shared with the central server and other participant in FL environment. Most common FL algorithms are FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> that aggregate the model parameters obtained from the participating clients. Most of the existing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> using these algorithms consider the homogeneous data and same architecture of the local model used by all participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In practical applications, each participant has its own data and might need to design its own customized model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> due to specific and personalized requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Such heterogeneity in data and model is natural in healthcare organizations that design custom models for specific tasks as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning for Data and Model Heterogeneity in Medical Imaging" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In such environment, hospitals are hesitant to reveal their data and model architecture due to privacy concerns and business matters. Thus, numerous methods have been proposed to perform FL with such heterogeneous data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is a method that implemented knowledge distillation based on class scoring calculated by local models of clients trained on public dataset. FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is another method that performs ensemble distillation by leveraging the unlabeled data for every model architecture. Such existing methods are dependent on shared models and mutual consensus. However, a mutual consensus is another challenge in which each client is unable to set its learning direction to adjust the deviations among all participants. Moreover, designing additional models enhance the processing overhead, and eventually affect the performance. Thus, FL containing heterogeneous data and models without depending on global sharing and consensus is critical and challenging.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Participating hospitals (i.e., clients) contain heterogeneous local models trained on heterogeneous data and diverse labels. Each client has its own data and custom model as per requirements and tasks.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The methods discussed above are mostly dependent on the assumption that every participant has homogeneous, independent and identically distributed (IID) data that is not possible in real-world scenarios. More specifically, in collaborative learning each participant has its own data and requires a customized model for the specific nature of data and task. As FL has many participants with heterogeneous models and data, each model suffers data diversity effecting the overall performance of the global model. Existing methods such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> have been presented that designed robust loss function to minimize the negative impact of heterogeneous labels in data. The current existing methods either tackle the data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity. In FL, it is required that a model should be robust and learn sufficiently from the data during local update.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle with the heterogeneous participants and data containing diverse labels are the prominent challenges in FL. Model heterogeneity in FL causes the diverse noise patterns and decision boundaries. Moreover, data heterogeneity based on non-IID and label diversity creates difficulty in convergence of the global model during global learning phase in FL. It is required for each client to concentrate on the contribution of other participants and align the learning to produce a robust global model. In this paper, we propose a solution for the heterogeneous data and model in FL. 1) For the model heterogeneity, a model distribution (i.e., logits output) is aligned by learning the knowledge distribution and feedback from other clients using public data. In this way, each participant learns with its own strategy without depending on the public model. 2) To tackle with the data heterogeneity having diverse labels, an additional symmetric loss function as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, is used to minimize the diversity impact on model learning.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL), firstly proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> is a machine learning method in which multiple clients train a global model without sharing their private local data to preserve the privacy. Initially, FedAvg was used to aggregate the parameters of local models trained on local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. A method similar to FedAvg has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> that can customize the local calculations with respect to the iterations and devices used in FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, weights of the layers in a client model are collected to accomplish one-layer matching that produce weight of every layer in the global model. Knowledge distillation has been utilized for the communication of FL heterogeneous models in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In this method, for each client, class scores obtained from the public dataset are collected on the server to calculate the aggregated value to be updated. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, unlabeled data leveraging ensemble distillation is used for the model fusion. Global parameters are dynamically assigned as a subset to the local clients according to their capabilities in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. An algorithm has been introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to produce a global model from the learning of local representations. We summarize that existing methods assume that all clients have homogeneous data without consideration of any type of heterogeneity. No research have been conducted for the mitigation of diverse impact of data and model heterogeneity simultaneously during the collaborative learning in FL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Numerous methods have been presented to tackle with data heterogeneity, but not much research have been conducted for the model heterogeneity and label diversity in the scenario of FL. Some existing methods use loss functions for the optimization such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. A convex classification calibration loss has been proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> that is robust for incorrect classes and labels. Some loss functions are evaluated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> that prove the robustness of MAE to perturbed classes in deep learning. Estimation of the probability for every class flipped to some other class has been utilized in existing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, corrupted data is transformed into Dirichlet distribution space and label regression technique is used to infer the correct classes, and finally data modeling and classifier are trained together.

In this method, the samples with minimum loss are selected to update the model parameters. MentorNet is another method proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> that comes up with a technique used to weight a sample such as used in StudentNet and MentorNet.

It does not make overall classes to learn enough from all categories due to various simplicity levels in the classes. To converge the model for such difficult classes, extra communication rounds are required for additional learning. In such scenario, there is a possibility of overfitting to the heterogeneous labels that eventually reduces the overall efficiency of the model.</p>

We use different labels-diversity techniques for the datasets used with heterogeneous models for the training. Performance of each method is decreased with the increasing labels-diversity rate. Moreover, there is a remarkable difference among all methods when the type of labels diversity is changed. This is because heterogeneous data or labels lead to wrong learning and communication of participating clients. Moreover, heterogeneous models produce different noise patterns that eventually decrease the model performance.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a real-world problem of model and data heterogeneity in medical imaging has been explored. To solve the problem of heterogeneous data and labels diversity, an additional symmetric loss has been used to optimize the model trained on local and private data. To tackle with the heterogeneous participants in FL, Kullback-Leibler has been exploited to align the different noise patterns produced by the heterogeneous participants. Moreover, each participating client uses the knowledge distribution of other participants to improve the performance of global FL model. Experimental results conclude that the proposed method outperforms the existing similar methods.</p>
