<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning-based fault diagnosis (FD) approaches require a large amount of training data, which are difficult to obtain since they are located across different entities. Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model with data privacy guaranteed. However, the domain discrepancy and data scarcity problems among clients deteriorate the performance of the global FL model. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called representation encoding-based federated meta-learning (REFML) for few-shot FD. First, a novel training strategy based on representation encoding and meta-learning is developed. It harnesses the inherent heterogeneity among training clients, effectively transforming it into an advantage for out-of-distribution generalization on unseen working conditions or equipment types. Additionally, an adaptive interpolation method that calculates the optimal combination of local and global models as the initialization of local training is proposed. This helps to further utilize local information to mitigate the negative effects of domain discrepancy. As a result, high diagnostic accuracy can be achieved on unseen working conditions or equipment types with limited training data. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, such as FedProx, the proposed REFML framework achieves an increase in accuracy by 2.17%-6.50% when tested on unseen working conditions of the same equipment type and 13.44%-18.33% when tested on totally unseen equipment types, respectively.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fault diagnosis (FD) plays a significant role in modern industry, ensuring safety and reliability, and preventing breakdowns and losses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Traditional FD methods require expert knowledge, such as identifying faults through analyzing abnormal sounds or utilizing signal processing techniques. However, these methods increased the labor intensity and difficulty for equipment operators as the industry continues to grow rapidly in size and frequently change its operational modes. The application of machine learning has made FD intelligent enough to automatically recognize health states and shorten maintenance cycles. Early on, sensitive features are extracted from data and fed into traditional machine learning models, such as expert systems, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, challenges arise from the difficulty of extracting specialized and proper features from large volumes of data and achieving accurate results with the limited learning capability of traditional diagnosis models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Deep Learning (DL) has become increasingly popular as a solution to address the aforementioned problems as it can learn abstracted representations without human intervention. A novel motor condition monitoring system with 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed and shown to achieve an elegant classification performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Liu <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed a novel method for FD with recurrent neural network (RNN) in the form of an autoencoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To realize efficient FD with low-quality data, an improved deep fused CNN-based method combined with a complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition and a short-time Fourier transform was proposed to fully mine fault features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. To alleviate the data imbalance in FD, a weakly supervised learning-based method was proposed to introduce real-world samples into the imbalanced dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and a novel method based on pre-training Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty was proposed to generate high-quality faulty samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, these data-driven methods require a large amount of labeled data. Although there is a vast amount of data collected by sensors in modern industry, generating labeled data is very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, in real industrial scenarios, data is scattered across different entities and privacy-sensitive, rendering it unfeasible to be gathered into centralized servers for training.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> empowers multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without compromising data privacy. An FL method for machinery FD with a self-supervised learning scheme was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The FL framework is also utilized in the context of class-imbalanced FD classification to facilitate the implementation of privacy-preserving functionalities<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, in practical industrial environments, working conditions and equipment types significantly vary across different companies and change frequently. This means the presence of domain discrepancy extends beyond the traditional demarcation between the training and testing stages. It involves the domain discrepancy between training clients and new clients, with inherent variations observed among individual training clients. As a result, the trained model cannot generalize well to out-of-distribution (OOD) data on new tasks with limited samples, because most learning algorithms heavily rely on the independent and identically distributed assumption on source/target data. Collecting and labeling sufficient data to address this issue is costly and impractical. Data-based approaches such as data sharing and augmentation work well, but may increase the risk of data privacy leakage under the FL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

A distribution-invariant deep belief network was proposed to learn distribution-invariant features directly from raw vibration data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Transfer learning (TL) is another way against the domain discrepancy problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, in which the knowledge from one or more tasks in the source domain can be reused for other related tasks in the target domain. Shao <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> developed a fast and accurate FD framework using TL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. A federated TL framework with discrepancy-based weighted federated averaging was proposed to train a good global FD model collaboratively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Meta-learning, a technique that also refers to leveraging previous knowledge to improve learning on new tasks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, focuses on learning to learn across a broader range of tasks rather than specific source and target tasks in TL. In industrial scenarios of frequently changing work conditions and equipment types, training a meta-learning model to achieve strong generalization capabilities can greatly meet practical demands. A novel meta-learning method based on model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> for FD in rolling bearings under varying working conditions with limited data was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Hu <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed a task-sequencing meta-learning method that sorts tasks from easy to difficult to get better knowledge adaptability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Moreover, meta-learning could also be combined with semi-supervised learning utilizing unlabeled data for better fault recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, as mentioned earlier, it is challenging to aggregate data from different entities and train models using centralized algorithms above in real-world production environments. In practical and common scenarios, it’s necessary to exploit privacy-preserving distributed training algorithms to address the issue of poor diagnosis performance on new tasks caused by domain discrepancy and data scarcity, which has not been fully researched. Furthermore, when considering the inherent domain discrepancies among the data from various participants in FL, it raises a fundamental question: how can we leverage this aspect to strengthen the model’s robustness when faced with unobserved tasks?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we tackle this challenge and propose a novel representation encoding-based federated meta-learning (REFML) framework for few-shot FD. REFML harnesses federated meta-learning (FML) and draws inspiration from representation learning for capturing discriminative feature representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. It leverages inherent heterogeneity among training clients by extracting meta-knowledge from different local diagnosis tasks and training a domain-invariant feature extractor in a privacy-preserving manner, effectively transforming it into an advantage for OOD generalization. Without compromising the privacy data of participating clients, the trained model can achieve high performance with very few training samples when encountering new tasks, such as those involving previously unseen working conditions or equipment types, making it well-suited for practical industrial FD scenarios with domain discrepancy and data scarcity problems.</p>

In traditional machine learning, the objective is to train a high-performing model on specific tasks with a fixed algorithm, including artificially designated network architecture, initialization parameters, update methods, and so on. However, in meta-learning, the aim is to find a high-performing algorithm that can adapt well to a set of tasks, particularly those that are unseen.</p>

</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">1) Security privacy: Data privacy has been widely and highly valued worldwide. Enterprises are increasingly cautious about the application of data, making it difficult to centralize sufficient data from mutually isolated “data islands” to train a well-performing model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">2) Domain discrepancy and data scarcity: Working conditions and equipment types from which data is collected significantly vary across different companies, and change frequently. Domain discrepancy problems not only exist between participating clients and new clients but also between clients participating in FL. Collecting and labeling sufficient data on new tasks is costly and impractical. It is challenging for models to perform well on new tasks with only a small amount of samples.</p>

In each round, every training client downloads the global model, conducts adaptive interpolation, representation encoding, meta-updating of the predictor, and uploads the model in sequence. Every testing client downloads the global model, conducts adaptive interpolation, and fine-tunes the model. In the following subsections, the proposed training process and the overall workflow of the proposed REFML method will be introduced in detail.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In general FL, clients download global model parameters at the beginning of each round and initialize their local models with these parameters. Facing data heterogeneity challenge in FL, a method of mixing global and local models has been proposed to balance generalization with personalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Inspired by this, we further exploit personal information in the model communication stage, that is using the optimal interpolation of the global model and the local model as the initial model rather than the global model itself, where the optimal interpolation weights are calculated adaptively using gradient-based search on local data.</p>

We consider the encoder as a domain-invariant representations learner across clients with different data distributions and the predictor as a meta-based classifier learning on a series of training tasks. The encoder contains three convolution units, and each of them is composed of a one-dimensional convolution layer, a batch normalization layer, a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation layer, and a max-pooling layer. It is responsible for extracting informative feature representations from raw data.</p>

Once trained, the aggregated encoder can capture domain-invariant features accurately, and the predictor with high-quality initialization parameters can adapt well to new tasks.

In other words, acquiring these adaptation abilities through a series of training tasks constitutes the process of extracting meta-knowledge, which in turn aids in the development of a robust generalization capability. When facing unobserved tasks, informative representations are extracted by the encoder from the raw data, and the predictor with high adaptability utilizes these representations to make accurate diagnoses.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our experiments, related FD models are based on CNN, which contains three convolution units and two FC layers. Each convolution unit is composed of a one-dimensional convolution layer, a batch normalization layer, a ReLU activation layer, and a max-pooling layer. Its output is flattened into a tensor with one dimension and a length of 4096 and then used as input for the following FC layers.

In each dataset, the working conditions of the meta-train and meta-test phases do not overlap.
Among all the data corresponding to different working conditions, a portion of the data associated with certain working conditions is selected as data for the training clients, while another portion is chosen for the testing clients. Each client corresponds to a specific working condition. The meta-knowledge extraction is conducted in tasks of the training clients, and the generalization ability of the trained model is evaluated in the tasks of testing clients.

To clearly demonstrate this process, the diagnostic accuracy of the 1-shot sub-experiments conducted on the CWRU dataset are shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-A3 PHM Data Challenge on 2009 (PHM2009) Dataset ‣ V-A Datasets ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Fault Diagnosis with Representation Encoding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. As we can see, although the generalization difficulty varies on different validation folds, for example, the performance of all algorithms is worse on the first fold than on other folds, the proposed REFML method achieves the best performance on all validation folds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The comparison results under different shot numbers with different methods are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-B2 Baselines ‣ V-B Experiment Setup ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Fault Diagnosis with Representation Encoding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> and a visualization form in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-B2 Baselines ‣ V-B Experiment Setup ‣ V Experiments ‣ Federated Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Fault Diagnosis with Representation Encoding" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. It can be seen that the FedAvg method achieves the lowest accuracy while the FedProx method performs better because of its improvement against heterogeneity by restricting the local updates to be closer to the global model. Another observation is that the fine-tuned versions of FedAvg and FedProx outperform their original versions since they utilize the data on the testing task to adapt the model. Most importantly, the proposed REFML method achieves the best performance across all datasets and all shot numbers, and within a single dataset, the accuracy increases as the shot number increases. It provides an increase of accuracy by 2.17%-6.50% compared to the FedProx-FT method when generalizing to unseen working conditions under different shot numbers. In addition, as the shot number increases, the degree of performance improvement diminishes. For example, in the CWRU dataset, the performance increases from 1-shot to 3-shot and from 3-shot to 5-shot are 3.37% and 1.30%, respectively. Similarly, in the other two datasets, the corresponding performance gains drop from 3.89% to 0.28% and from 1.25% to 0.63%, respectively.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have developed REFML to address the challenge of poor diagnosis performance in industrial FD caused by data privacy, domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model with high generalization ability while ensuring data privacy. The trained model can achieve superior performance on unobserved working conditions or equipment types even with limited training data. Specifically, a novel training strategy based on representation encoding and meta-learning has been invented, which harnesses data heterogeneity among training clients to facilitate OOD generalization in new clients by extracting meta-knowledge from different local diagnosis tasks and training a domain-invariant feature extractor. Furthermore, an adaptive interpolation method has been designed to calculate the optimal combination of local and global models before local training, which further utilizes local information to achieve better model performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Experiments conducted on three real datasets have demonstrated that the proposed REFML method could perform well on unseen tasks using very limited training data with privacy guaranteed. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed REFML framework achieves an increase in accuracy by 2.17%-6.50% when tested on unseen working conditions of the same equipment type and 13.44%-18.33% when tested on totally unseen equipment types, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While our results demonstrate the promise of REFML, it suffers from high computational complexity due to the calculation of second-order derivatives in MAML. Future research includes exploring computationally efficient variants of MAML to enhance the practicality, scalability, and accuracy considering system heterogeneity.</p>
