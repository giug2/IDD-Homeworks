<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">With the aim of integrating over-the-air federated learning (AirFL) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into an on-demand universal framework, this paper proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided hybrid network by leveraging the RIS to flexibly adjust the decoding order of heterogeneous data.
A new metric of computation rate is defined to measure the performance of AirFL users.
Upon this, the objective of this work is to maximize the achievable hybrid rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power, controlling the receive scalar, and designing the reflection coefficients.
Since the concurrent transmissions of all computation and communication signals are aided by the discrete phase-shifting elements at the RIS, the formulated problem (P0) is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem.
To tackle this intractable issue, we decompose the original problem (P0) into a non-convex problem (P1) and a combinatorial problem (P2), which are characterized by the continuous and discrete variables, respectively.
For the transceiver design problem (P1), the power allocation subproblem is first solved by difference-of-convex programming, and then the receive control subproblem is addressed by successive convex approximation, where the closed-form expressions of simplified cases are derived to obtain deep insights.
For the reflection design problem (P2), a relaxation-then-quantization method is adopted to find a suboptimal solution for striking a trade-off between complexity and performance.
Afterwards, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve the non-linear non-convex problem (P0) iteratively.
Finally, simulation results reveal that
i) the proposed RIS-aided hybrid network can support on-demand communication and computation efficiently,
ii) the system performance can be improved by properly selecting the location of the RIS,
and
iii) the designed algorithms are also applicable to conventional networks with only AirFL or NOMA users.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The prosperity of machine learning is expected to provide pervasive intelligence for beyond fifth generation (B5G) networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which will also make the ubiquitous data transmission more sensitive and demanding from privacy protection to resource utilization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
By exploring the superposition property of wireless channels to compute a target function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and allowing all participants to collaboratively train a shared model with keeping their raw data locally, over-the-air federated learning (AirFL) is greatly desired in many resource-limited and privacy-sensitive scenarios empowered by large-scale machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, as the number of connected devices and data traffic grow exponentially, the data-intensive applications would demand heterogeneous services such as high throughput, ultra reliability, and low latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Being helpful to overcome the challenges raised from the massive connectivity and resource scarceness, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been deemed as one of the promising enablers for future networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
To efficiently cope with the differentiated requirements of the hybrid networks consisting of both AirFL and NOMA users, it is particularly important to design an on-demand universal framework that is capable of integrating computation and communication together for meeting the diversity needs of the forthcoming flourish applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since the conflicts between the spectrum scarcity of existing networks and the bandwidth requirements of emerging applications are ever-increasingly striking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the co-design of distributed machine learning and wireless communication is essential for B5G networks to bring considerable gains in terms of latency reduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, spectrum efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and hardware cost.
To this end, understanding the similarity and difference between AirFL and NOMA is extremely valuable for the seamless integration of them.
On the one hand, the uplink transmissions of AirFL are over the same multiple-access channel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which is similar to that of NOMA technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, the AirFL concentrates on the computation result rather than the individual data itself <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which is different from NOMA.
Exploiting the mentioned similarity, the signals from hybrid users can be multiplexed on the same channel simultaneously.
However, it is still not a trivial task to provide heterogeneous services over limited radio spectrum, due to the processing difficulties of the mixed signals.
Therefore, it is highly desired for the hybrid network to deploy the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for dynamically tuning the wireless channels, which plays a key role to flexibly adjust the signal processing order of hybrid users.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, both AirFL and NOMA have attracted compelling attention, but most previous studies have focused on the separate implementation of AirFL and NOMA in diverse scenarios such as the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
However, the network architecture may be isolated and dedicated if designed independently, which inevitably makes the flexibility and versatility of existing networks insufficient.
By establishing an explicit expression for the packet error rate and the convergence rate of federated learning, Chen <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et. al</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> provided a joint learning and communication algorithm to reduce the training loss.
Different from the conventional communication paradigms based on orthogonal multiple access, by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channels, multiple users are able to implement model aggregation (i.e., function computation) over-the-air with the help of the remote base station (BS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Thus, the new technique called AirFL is recently developed, which is beneficial to alleviate the communication latency dramatically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
In order to improve the convergence rate and prediction accuracy of AirFL, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed a difference-of-convex (DC) programming based method to optimize the device selection and active beamforming for aggregation error minimization.
Additionally, to overcome the unfavorable noise brought by the wireless environment, Jiang <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et. al</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> deployed the RIS to alleviate the signal distortion of AirFL.
Moreover, our previous work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> jointly designed the transceiver and reflection settings to further enhance the learning performance of AirFL with the aid of multiple intelligent surfaces.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the interference caused by the spectrum sharing among multiple users, efficient resource management and interference mitigation are the fundamental research challenges for NOMA networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
To improve the spectrum efficiency, Zhao <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et. al</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> formulated a joint problem of spectrum allocation and power control in NOMA enhanced heterogeneous networks.
Also, by adopting the matching theory and optimization methods, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> aimed to provide better user experience in the multi-cell NOMA networks with multiple subcarriers.
Besides, considering the problems in RIS-aided NOMA networks, cases from ideal and non-ideal RIS to single and multi-cell were discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, respectively.
Motivated by the ability to learn from long-term evolution, Liu <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et. al</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> developed reinforcement learning based approaches to solve the RIS deployment problem in a highly dynamic NOMA network.
However, most prior works ignore the system heterogeneity from device status to service requirements.
For instance, the computation units and energy supplies of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are usually insufficient, which makes them prefer to data offloading rather than local computing.
Moreover, future networks may involve a multitude of user devices in most cases, their services and applications can be quite various from one another <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, these behavior heterogeneities should be carefully addressed to fulfill the intelligence vision of next-generation wireless networks.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Again, although previous studies have well investigated the separate design, the network-wide convergence of distributed learning and wireless communication is still a nascent field and many open issues deserve exploration.
The goal of this work is to consider:
Is it possible to seamlessly merge distributed machine learning into traditional wireless networks with constrained resources, and what role can RIS play in it?
Note that the integration of AirFL and NOMA makes the received superposition signal at the BS quite complicated, namely two different types of users are multiplexed on the same channel, which also makes the critical issues of integrated networks different from that of conventional networks consisting of only AirFL or NOMA users.
In summary, this entails the following challenges.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At present, it is generally difficult for the computation-centric AirFL to be integrated into the communication-centric wireless networks.
So far a huge challenge is how to distinguish the homogeneous signals received simultaneously from different types of users, which motivates us to rethink existing techniques as reliable solutions for building a universal framework.</p>

Most existing works address the computation error issue only by minimizing the signal distortion measured by the mean-square-error (MSE) but neglect the performance comparison requirements of different user types, which thus motivates us to give a novel metric for defining a comparable evaluation methodology.</p>

Not to mention that the previous researches on RIS-aided hybrid networks are insufficient, or even almost none.</p>

<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we first combine the communication-centric NOMA users and the computation-centric AirFL users into one concurrent uplink transmission.
Then, the RIS is leveraged to adjust the signal processing order of successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding via tuning the channel quality of hybrid users on demand.
By doing so, the concurrent transmission of heterogeneous data is capable of providing the high spectrum efficiency and low latency services to satisfy diverse requirements.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to provide a universal framework by leveraging the RIS to unify NOMA communication and collaborative computation via concurrent uplink transmission.

In order to unify the performance metrics of different user types, we define an exact expression of computation rate to evaluate the learning behavior of AirFL users.
Based on which, we aim to maximize the hybrid rate (defined as the weighted sum of the communication rate and the computation rate) by jointly optimizing the continuous transceiver scalars and the discrete phase shifts at the RIS, while satisfying the minimum rate requirements of NOMA users and the maximum aggregation error of AirFL users.
The formulated resource allocation problem is analyzed to be a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP), where the network characterization is represented effectively.</p>

Furthermore, regarding the simplified cases without quality-of-service (QoS) and MSE constraints, we provide explicit closed-form solutions for power allocation at the NOMA users and the receive control at the BS, respectively.

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Since all users are served by the entire bandwidth simultaneously, interference management is an essential issue for the hybrid network composed of both AirFL and NOMA users, especially the interference from inter-type users.
Using SIC techniques, the BS can first decode the signals of strong users in a successive order to remove the interference, and then it is able to obtain the superposed signal of weak users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
To take advantage of this technique, all NOMA users are expected to become strong users and all AirFL users are anticipated to be treated as weak users in the hybrid network.
By doing so, the BS is capable of eliminating the interference from NOMA users for these AirFL users via SIC decoding before executing global model aggregation.</p>

From this figure, one can notice that it is highly desired for the AirFL and NOMA hybrid network to flexibly adjust the signal processing order of hybrid users by effectively deploying the RIS to change multiple-access channels.
In order to guide the adjustment of SIC decoding order (i.e., tuning the AirFL users into weak users), the following constraint should be met by judiciously optimizing the phase shifts at the RIS, i.e.,</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, the SIC decoding order only depends on the uplink channel gains of hybrid users, and is assumed to be fixed for simplicity.
The design of more complicated SIC decoding schemes may further improve the attainable system performance, but this is beyond the scope of this work.
Note that the RIS in this paper acts as a coordinator to dynamically adjust the channel coefficient between two types of users, which makes the SIC decoding order more flexible.
Compared with many previous studies that only use RIS to improve the performance of existing networks, the RIS in our proposed universal framework plays a very important role in maintaining the decoding order given in (<a href="#S2.E5" title="In II-B RIS-Aided Concurrent Transmission ‣ II System Model ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>).</p>

On the whole, there is no standard optimization approach to find the global optimal solution for the NP-hard problem (<a href="#S3.E15" title="In III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>) directly.
To address this MINLP problem effectively for obtaining high quality suboptimal solutions, we propose to decouple it into the following two subproblems:</p>

As a result, subject to the QoS requirements of NOMA users, the MSE tolerance of AirFL users, and the transmit power constraints, the non-convex and non-linear problem for transceiver design can be given by</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Note that the transceiver design subproblem (<a href="#S3.E16" title="In item 1 ‣ III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) is very challenging even when only the transmit power subproblem or the receive scalar subproblem is considered.
Moreover, the reflection design subproblem (<a href="#S3.E17" title="In item 2 ‣ III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>) is still intractable even we relax the phase shifts into continuous ones.
Although subproblems (<a href="#S3.E16" title="In item 1 ‣ III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) looks simpler than the original problem (<a href="#S3.E15" title="In III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>), it is still almost impossible to derive closed-form solutions for the transmit power and receive scalar in the considered RIS-aided hybrid network.
Not to mention that the combinatorial feature of subproblem (<a href="#S3.E17" title="In item 2 ‣ III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>) makes it NP-hard and much more complicated, e.g., there are <math id="S3.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="B^{M}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p4.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">B</mi><mi id="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">M</mi></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐵</ci><ci id="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p4.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑀</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p4.1.m1.1c">B^{M}</annotation></semantics></math> operation modes of the phase shifts to be tested if the exhaustive search is used <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
To avoid an unacceptable computation complexity, one common approach is to transform these non-linear and non-convex subproblems of transceiver control and reflection design into convex ones, and then standard methods can be invoked to solve them separately and alternatively over iterations.
As a consequence, the alternating optimization technique can be adopted as an intuitive approach to solve the MINLP problem (<a href="#S3.E15" title="In III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>) in an efficient manner.</p>

<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For providing a clear illustration, Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> gives an overview of the roadmap to solve the hybrid rate maximization problem, especially the connections between key optimization subproblems and the designed algorithms.
Firstly, the original MINLP problem (<a href="#S3.E15" title="In III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>) is decomposed into two subproblems: the non-convex transceiver design subproblem (<a href="#S3.E16" title="In item 1 ‣ III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) and the combinatorial reflection design problem (<a href="#S3.E17" title="In item 2 ‣ III Problem Formulation and Decomposition ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>), which are characterized by the continuous variables and discrete variables.
Secondly, the subproblems of transmit power allocation, receive scalar control, phase shifts design are solved sequentially in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Alternating Optimization ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> by using common optimization methods such as DC programming, SCA, and SDR.
Notably, closed-form solutions for some simplified cases are derived to provide useful insights.</p>

Moreover, it is worth pointing out that full power transmission is always the optimal solution for NOMA users in the absence of QoS requirement, regardless of the configurations of the RIS in problem (<a href="#S4.E21" title="In IV-A1 Power allocation of NOMA users ‣ IV-A Transmit Power Allocation ‣ IV Alternating Optimization ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">21</span></a>).

As such, the problem (<a href="#S4.E23" title="In IV-A2 Power allocation of AirFL users ‣ IV-A Transmit Power Allocation ‣ IV Alternating Optimization ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">23</span></a>) can be re-expressed as a canonical DC programming problem with convex feasible set.
Specifically, by replacing (<a href="#S4.Ex2" title="IV-A2 Power allocation of AirFL users ‣ IV-A Transmit Power Allocation ‣ IV Alternating Optimization ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-A</span>2</span></a>) with its first-order approximation, the non-convex objective function in (<a href="#S4.E23.1" title="In 23 ‣ IV-A2 Power allocation of AirFL users ‣ IV-A Transmit Power Allocation ‣ IV Alternating Optimization ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">23a</span></a>) can be well approximated by the concave objective in (<a href="#S4.E26.1" title="In 26 ‣ IV-A2 Power allocation of AirFL users ‣ IV-A Transmit Power Allocation ‣ IV Alternating Optimization ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">26a</span></a>).

However, it may be ineffective for some practical cases with very low resolution (e.g., <math id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="b=1" display="inline"><semantics id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">b</mi><mo id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑏</ci><cn type="integer" id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Thmremark2.p1.1.1.m1.1c">b=1</annotation></semantics></math>) and small RIS (e.g., <math id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M\leq 5" display="inline"><semantics id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1" xref="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mo id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">≤</mo><mn id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">5</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1"><leq id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.1"></leq><ci id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><cn type="integer" id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.3">5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Thmremark2.p1.2.2.m2.1c">M\leq 5</annotation></semantics></math>), due to the non-negligible performance loss.
To overcome this drawback, an exhaustive search-based method can be used to obtain an optimal solution for the low resolution and small RIS cases.</em><span id="Thmremark2.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"></span></p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.6" class="ltx_p">In Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm versus the iteration number is depicted, which illustrates that the proposed AO-based algorithm can converge under different number of users, reflecting elements and quantization resolution.
Furthermore, it is observed that the hybrid rate grows quickly with the number of iterations, which also increases with the number of users and reflecting elements, owing to the fact that there are more variables to be optimized over iterations.

From this figure, it also can be seen that with higher quantization resolution, the configuration of the RIS becomes more flexible and thus achieves better convergence performance.</p>

Namely, it is harmful for hybrid rate maximization to deploy the RIS at the midpoint between the BS and the users.
Therefore, the system performance can be significantly improved by carefully selecting the location of the RIS, which provides guidance for the practical deployment of the RIS.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B2 Impact of the RIS location ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we investigate the performance of the proposed RIS-aided hybrid network versus different number of AirFL users in the unified framework.
Here the number of NOMA users is fixed as we focus on the impact of AirFL users.
One can observe from Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B2 Impact of the RIS location ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, for all considered schemes, the achievable hybrid rate will rise steadily as the number of AirFL users grows gradually in the system.
This verifies that the remarks still hold true when the number of users increases.
Not surprisingly, the schemes of ‘Continuous RIS’ are capable of outperforming other benchmarks with/without QoS and MSE constraints.
This shows the great strength of high-resolution RIS in mitigating communication interference and enhancing function aggregation in the integrated network, despite this may increase the production cost of RIS.

Specifically, the first row of Fig. <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ V-B5 Separate design versus unified design ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Integrating Over-the-Air Federated Learning and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: What Role can RIS Play?" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> evaluates the impact of the number of reflecting elements on the achievable rate under three cases.
On the whole, the following two insights can easily be drawn.
The first one is that the achievable rate under all cases grows with the number of reflecting elements <math id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.7.m7.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.7.m7.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.7.m7.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.7.m7.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math>, which reveals the effectiveness of having more reflecting elements at the RIS.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel RIS-aided hybrid network to effectively integrate AirFL and NOMA into an elastic framework.
The role of RIS is twofold: i) efficiently enhance the channel condition and networking coverage that may be unfavorable due to complete blockage, and ii) flexibly change the channel gains of hybrid users to achieve an on-demand decoding order that is efficient for NOMA, for AirFL, and for the combination of both.
Specifically, we investigated an intractable resource allocation problem of the RIS-aided hybrid network by jointly optimizing the transmit power, the receive scalar, and the phase shifts for hybrid rate maximization while meeting QoS requirements as well as MSE tolerance.
To address this challenging mixed-combinatorial optimization problem, we devised an alternating optimization algorithm to tackle the decoupled non-convex subproblems by iteratively adopting approximation techniques such as DC programming, SCA, and SDR methods.
Besides, regarding the reduced subproblems of transmit power allocation and receive scalar design, the optimal solutions were derived in closed form.
Furthermore, the complexity and convergence performance were analyzed.
Finally, simulation results demonstrated that the proposed RIS-aided network can simultaneously serve hybrid users on the entire bandwidth effectively, and the achievable hybrid rate can be significantly enhanced by tuning the RIS judiciously.</p>
