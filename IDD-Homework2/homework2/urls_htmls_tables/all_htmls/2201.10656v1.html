<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Learning to answer visual questions is a challenging task since the multi-modal inputs are within two feature spaces.
Moreover, reasoning in visual question answering requires the model to understand both image and question, and align them in the same space, rather than simply memorize statistics about the question-answer pairs.
Thus, it is essential to find component connections between different modalities and within each modality to achieve better attention.
Previous works learned attention weights directly on the features.
However, the improvement is limited since these two modality features are in two domains: image features are highly diverse, lacking structure and grammatical rules as language, and natural language features have a higher probability of missing detailed information.
To better learn the attention between visual and text, we focus on how to construct input stratification and embed structural information to improve the alignment between different level components.
We propose Multi-Granularity Alignment architecture for Visual Question Answering task (MGA-VQA), which learns intra- and inter-modality correlations by multi-granularity alignment, and outputs the final result by the decision fusion module.
In contrast to previous works, our model splits alignment into different levels to achieve learning better correlations without needing additional data and annotations.
The experiments on the VQA-v2 and GQA datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms non-pretrained state-of-the-art methods on both datasets without extra pretraining data and annotations.
Moreover, it even achieves better results over the pre-trained methods on GQA.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) continues to be a topic of interest due to its broad range of applications, such as the early education system and visual chatbot.
Multidisciplinary research on VQA has yielded innovations in multi-modality alignment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ilievski2017multi-modal</span>]</cite>, natural language understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, image understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and even multi-modal reasoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Early methods addressed the multi-modal problem by the simple concatenation of visual features obtained from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and natural language features obtained from Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Although they established milestones in this field and have provided insights into merging features, such simple fusion methods do not offer good performance.
This has motivated many additional related works that primarily focus on furtherly processing the features before merging, i.e., embedding these features into a new space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> or utilizing an attention mechanism to achieve better alignment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Another related research direction has involved the construction of graphs to represent image information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
These explorations aimed to determine an effective way to achieve better alignment between multi-modal features;
however, the direct fusion of whole fine-grained image features and whole natural language sentences is complicated and lacks interpretability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Taking Figure <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ MGA-VQA: Multi-Granularity Alignment for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> as an example, while a human can easily answer the question, a model cannot directly achieve that if without further processing the raw visual and language features for a better alignment.
However, if the multimodel components are correspondingly well-aligned, the model can work more straightforwardly to infer the answer.
More specifically, a machine that attends to specific words or concepts in the questions and specific visual components in the image would arguably be more robust to linguistic variations, irrelevant to the question’s meaning and answer.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We tackle this problem by implementing granularity level alignment.
Apart from only determining “where to look” for visual and textual attention, we try to achieve “looking correlation at the same level”.
One solution for achieving efficient attention-based alignment is to implement a Transformer (TRM).
Such architecture was first proposed as a machine translation model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and later popularly implemented in multi-modality-based tasks due to its good alignment ability.
However, many related works are pre-trained models, which require extra computational resources and extra human labor to collect additional data and its annotations (i.e., 3.3M images and captions for Conceptual Captions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>). To make it even worse, for some domains, i.e., medical, it is hard to obtain and annotate such a large-scale external dataset.
Thus, unlike conventional Transformers, our focus is to more effectively learn multi-modality alignment without extra data.
To achieve this, we embed graph-structured information into our model by involving the concept of lead graphs.

The following three granularity levels represent the image information: concept level, region level, and spatial level.

(The lead graph in the figure is for demonstration, where its value is randomly set.)
Finally, the outputs are combined by the decision fusion module to obtain the final prediction.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a popular joint visual language task that has been of increasing interest over the last few years.
Its main task is to answer questions about a provided image.
Similar to other multi-modal tasks, VQA requires the model to understand both the image and natural language and to combine their features of the two modalities.
However, there is a greater reliance on reasoning when answering visual questions.
Implementing this reasoning ability is challenging, since the features of the two modalities lie in two very different domains: images lack the grammatical structure of the natural language, and it is high possible that the latter is biased in the sense that it makes it difficult for the model to output correct answers.
These further motivate the construction of a model that can align these two features properly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Early solutions employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to embed the image and question, respectively, and extracted features are them directly fused (i.e., via concatenation or a shallow network) to obtain the result <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">fukui2016multi-modal</span>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.
In other works, one modality is further processed before fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, or both are jointly embedded into a new space by additional networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Yet other works proposed architectures that imply element-wise summation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> or multiplication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to achieve better fusion of multi-modal features.

Some works learn textual attention for questions and visual attention for images simultaneously.
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> presents a hierarchical co-attention model for VQA that jointly reasons image and question attention.

These works focus on the alignment between text features and fine-grained image features, where images lack language structure and grammatical rules, leading to difficulty in obtaining a good result.
In addition, most of these works process questions in a simple manner and ignore the inner logical relations in the natural language domain.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> was initially proposed as a powerful machine translation model.
However it gained substantial attention due to its ability to learn attention in all positions.
In contrast to recurrent neural networks, Transformer expands the ability of the model to focus on the inner relations between sentences,producing a so-called “self-attention” property. (i.e., demonstrative term in the sentence)
For example, when translating the sentence “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired,” it would be helpful to know which word “it” refers to, as this would greatly improve the translation result.
Due to the self-attention property, the Transformer architecture has been applied to other tasks beyond image captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> or visual question answering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>; it also shows up in the works of vision-and-language navigation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and video understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, implementation of the Transformer architecture aids the model in learning cross-modal representations from a concatenated sequence of visual region features and language token embeddings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
In addition, it learns joint representations that are appropriately contextualized in both modalities.
However, these alignments are always achieved by pre-training on additional dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We now introduce our Multi-Granularity Alignment Transformer for VQA (MGA-VQA).
Our main idea of the model is to align multiple information levels accordingly between multi-modal inputs and to integrate the information to obtain the final prediction.

First, objects are detected from the input image, with their names, corresponding attributes, and relations.
On the question side, noun phrases, entities, and sentence grammatical structure are detected.
Then lead graphs are used to furtherly guide alignment learning, and they are constructed from the structural information extracted in the above steps, where the nodes in the graphs are regarded as the token features for the next steps.
These features are the basic components of the following three levels of granularity alignment transformers (GA-TRMs): information of the concept level and entity level, information of the region level and noun phrase level, and information of the spatial level and sentence level.
Finally, the outputs of the three GA-TRMs are used to predict the answer via the decision fusion module.</p>

Instead of directly input the sentence token into the Transformer to fuse multi-modality features, we first use an extra Transformer module to process the sentence to get the context-aware features <math id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\textbf{T}_{s}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_bold" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.2a.cmml">T</mtext><mi id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">s</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.2a.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.2"><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_bold" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.2">T</mtext></ci><ci id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1.1.3">𝑠</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p4.3.m3.1c">\textbf{T}_{s}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

For each token, a query vector (<span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.10.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">Q</span>), a key vector (<span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.10.2" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">K</span>), and a value vector (<span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.10.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">V</span>) are created, by multiplying the embeddings of the three matrices that are trained during the training process.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our model is designed to only use visual question answer annotation pairs to learn finer grained latent features.
However, existing pre-training models rely on the additional labeled data describing finer-grained granularity (e.g., captioning) to explicitly learn finer-grained features, which require more computational resources and extra supervised data.
Thus, our experiments are focused on training our model from scratch (a.k.a., non-pretraining).
Nevertheless, our method not only achieves significant performance gain over existing non-pretraining methods, but also achieves competitive performance with some of pretraining methods.
Next, we will show you detailed results.

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To validate each component of our model, we conducted experiments for an ablation study, and the results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Experimental setup and results ‣ MGA-VQA: Multi-Granularity Alignment for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
The columns “Single Modality” and “Multi-Modality” represent whether features from both the image and the question are used for the final answer prediction.
The single modality setting uses only the question as the input, which tests whether the model’s good performance comes from the language bias of the dataset.
Since there are no image features under the single modality setting, the multi-granularity alignment is not applicable.
For the multi-modality setting, three experiments were conducted in order to verify each level’s granularity alignment.
To guarantee fair comparisons, we always set three different initialized Transformer modules for each single-level granularity alignment, preventing the model scale from affecting the experimental result.
To address the concerns about if the current merging method involves redundancy in concept-entity level, we set experiment about “Node Reduction” by merging the same entity nodes in two graphs into one node and combining their connecting edges.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Experiments 21, 22, and 23 show the performance of using a single alignment for multi-modality, validating the need for multiple granularity level alignments.
In addition, more abstract information leads to a higher overall accuracy, which may be due to achieving a better and easier alignment.
However, when there is inaccurate information in the high-level granularity alignment, the lower-level granularity alignment will help provide some of the details.
More examples of this are shown in Section <a href="#S4.SS6" title="4.6 Qualitative results ‣ 4 Experimental setup and results ‣ MGA-VQA: Multi-Granularity Alignment for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.6</span></a>.
Experiment 24 shows that the good performance is not from the bias of the dataset.
Experiment 25 is used to test the validity of the lead graph, and the results indicate that with such guidance, the overall performance is improved.
Experiment 26 shows that the tokens in different modalities play their roles, and removing them leads to bad performance.
To further validate our model’s reasoning ability, we train and evaluate our model with the ground-truth scene graphs and achieve 92.79% result.
Since there is no annotated scene information of the testing split, we randomly divided the validation split into two, one for validation and the other for testing.</p>

The results highlight the promising performance of our method; our model turns out to be able to find correlated elements for both modalities, and even at the image concept level, if the attributes are not accurately detected, with the assistance of the low-level alignment, the model obtains the correct final results (i.e., in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.4.1 Overall performance ‣ 4.4 Quantitative results on GQA ‣ 4 Experimental setup and results ‣ MGA-VQA: Multi-Granularity Alignment for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (d), the attribute of the spoon is not detected as wood.)</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a novel architecture named MGA-VQA.
In contrast to previous works that align visual and question features at a single level, our proposed Transformer-based model achieves multi-granularity alignment and jointly learns the intra- and inter-modality correlations.
In addition, we construct a decision fusion module to merge the outputs from different granularity Transformer modules.
In experiments, our model achieves outperforming results in GQA dataset and decent results in VQA-v2 dataset.
Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to quantify the role of each component in our model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Research on graph-based VQA remains ongoing.
One direction is involving pre-training mechanisms into current multiple granularity alignment and building a better decision fusion module.
The other direction is finding a strategy to better overcome misdetection or incorrect detections at a single granularity level.
Our MGA-VQA is an attempt to explore this issue. However, we expect that additional, related research will be conducted in the future.</p>
