<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Access to high quality data is the lifeblood of AI. Although AI holds strong promise in numerous high-stakes domains, the lack of high-quality datasets creates a significant hurdle for the development of AI, leading to missed opportunities.
Specifically, three prominent issues contribute to this challenge: <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data scarcity</span>, <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">privacy</span>, and <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">bias</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Mehrabi et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Gianfrancesco et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>, Tashea, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, Dastin, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite>. As a result, the dataset may not be available, accessible, or suitable for building performant and socially responsible AI systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sambasivan et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data has the potential to fuel the development of AI by unleashing the information in datasets that are small, sensitive or biased. This topic has recently achieved much excitement and attention in the AI community, which led to the proposal of many novel methodologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Jordon et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>, Yoon et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Ho et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Mehrabi et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, van Breugel et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, Yoon et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>, Saxena and Cao, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite>. In contrast to traditional generative models, whose sole objective is to learn the distribution of the input data, the new class of generators are designed to produce high-fidelity synthetic data while satisfying additional constraints and properties, such as differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Dwork, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>]</cite>, counterfactual fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Kusner et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite>, and causal invariances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Pearl, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>]</cite>.
Training downstream AI algorithms on the synthetic data would imbue them with these desirable properties, thereby providing better privacy, fairness, and robustness.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>The software challenge for synthetic data</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the great progress in synthetic data research, its practical application is still in infancy. Much of the difficulty arises from two interlinked challenges in developing software for synthetic data generation, as depicted in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Synthetic data technology promises to empower AI ‣ Synthcity: facilitating innovative use cases of synthetic data in different data modalities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and detailed below.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">1. The problem settings are diverse.</span>
The combination of different <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data modalities</span> and <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">use cases</span> creates a large number of problem settings where no single generator (or class of generators) can expect to capture.
The datasets in practical applications have diverse modalities ranging from images, videos, and texts to tabular data which can be static, temporal or subject to various types of missingness and censoring.
There also exist datasets collected from multiple sources, environments or views.
Furthermore, the three main use cases (fairness, privacy and augmentation) involve different formalism, assumptions and methodology.
Hence, while there exist many software libraries that can handle certain specific settings, a general platform that provides solutions to a wide range of problems is still lacking (as shown later in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4 Comparison with existing libraries ‣ Synthcity: facilitating innovative use cases of synthetic data in different data modalities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>).
This creates an obstacle for wide adoption of synthetic data technology.
For instance, a practitioner may very often find that the problem at hand cannot be solved by any of the existing software.
In addition, having many specialized software also creates difficulty in software testing and maintenance, which are essential for high stake applications. The practitioner may also find it difficult to trust a library that has only been applied to narrow scenarios by a small user community.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2. The model choice is contextual.</span>
The community has developed a large number of generative models in the last decades. However, all models have their unique area of strengths and they encode different prior assumptions and inductive biases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Bond-Taylor et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite>. Hence, it is no surprise that prior works have repeatedly shown that no model consistently performs the best across all data modalities and use cases.
For instance, deep generative models, such as GANs, excel at large image datasets, but they may fall short at small tabular data if not carefully trained and regularized.
This observation brings the conclusion that practitioners need a big arsenal of methods available at hand to address the diverse problem settings encountered in real applications.
Yet, many cutting edge methods are currently implemented in individual code repositories that are not modular, reusable or interoperable.
Such repositories are usually made public along with the accepted paper and only implements one or few methods. Although beneficial for reproducibility, these repositories often cannot be easily extended, reused or combined.
This creates a significant hurdle for experimenting and comparing different methods or extend them to broader settings.
Creating a master repository that superficially collects many individual repositories is not an adequate solution because it does not fundamentally address the interoperability issue.

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In order to enable wider adoption of synthetic data and facilitate translational research in this promising area, the community needs a software platform that implements a large collection of state-of-the-art generators in a modular, reusable and composable way.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenges above, we started the synthcity project, an open-source initiative to create a software platform that facilitates innovative use cases of synthetic data in fairness, privacy and augmentation across diverse data modalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We are now excited to announce the initial beta release of synthcity library (available on <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/synthcity/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">pip</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">GitHub</a>). Synthcity is the first software library that covers all the major use cases of synthetic data including fairness, privacy, and augmentation in addition to the standard generation task. Furthermore, it also provides a diverse list of evaluation metrics to measure the quality of synthetic data. Last but not least, synthcity contains many utility functions to automate and streamline the workflow (e.g. automatically benchmarking the performance of multiple data generators).</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this version, we have focused on the generation of <span id="S3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">tabular data</span> due to its commonality in various industries and applications.
Tabular data is widespread in industries where data is based on relational databases including healthcare, finance, manufacturing etc. It is often in these regulated industries that data access is a challenge, making synthetic data beneficial.
We also emphasize that “tabular data” encapsulates many different data modalities, including static tabular data, time series data, and censored survival data, all of which may contain a mix of continuous and discrete features (columns). Synthcity can also handle composite datasets composed of multiple subsets of data. In future versions, we plan to include more data modalities and implements additional generators.
Synthcity is a live project under continuous development. We cordially invite the community to join the development effort by submitting comments, bug reports, and pull requests on GitHub.</p>

We plan to add native support for missing data in future versions of synthcity.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To better contextualize the utility of synthcity, here we conceive several illustrative use cases in different industries. This is by no means a comprehensive list, and we encourage the reader to come up with other usage scenarios and share the story with us.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">5.1 </span>De-biasing medical datasets to build better and fairer prognostic scores</h3>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Electronic health records (EHR) and biobanks can be used by medical researchers to build disease prognostic scores. Such scores allow the healthcare service to allocate medical resources more efficiently (e.g. performing triage). They can also inform the design and execution of clinical trials (e.g. stratifying patient population).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, EHR and biobanks may often under-represent certain populations (e.g. the ones with less privileged access to health service). As a result, naively building prognostic scores on these data may lead to undesirable and unfair decisions. To mitigate the bias, one may re-balance the real data by augmenting it with synthetically generated minority groups. Synthcity facilitates this use case by providing a variety of standard, conditional, and multi-domain generative models as well as tools for evaluating the synthetic data.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">5.2 </span>Using synthetic multi-source data to select the target audience of marketing campaigns</h3>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To maximize the performance of a digital marketing campaign, the marketeer needs to locate the right customer segment to display the ad. This requires analyzing historical data from different segments. However, the data might be scarce for certain customer segments (e.g. the VIP users) and cannot fully support the analytics. In this case, one may consider augmenting the data using knowledge from other segments. Synthcity supports cross-domain data augmentation with deep generative models. The augmented synthetic data can then be combined with real data to inform the campaign setup.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The data holder may be interested in outsourcing the analytical modeling task to a contractor or the open science community (e.g. running a data science competition). However, the data holder cannot share real data with these external parties due to the sensitivity of data. A possible solution is to use the privacy-preserving generators in synthcity to create synthetic datasets. After evaluating the datasets in terms of fidelity and privacy, the data holder may share the synthetic data to the external parties to build the analytical models. The trained models can then be transferred to the data holders for evaluation and deployment on real data.</p>
