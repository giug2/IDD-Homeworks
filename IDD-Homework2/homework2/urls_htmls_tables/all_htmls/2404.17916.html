<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To deal with heterogeneity resulting from label distribution skew and data scarcity in distributed machine learning scenarios, this paper proposes a novel Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithm, named Federated Contrastive Representation Learning (FedCRL). FedCRL introduces contrastive representation learning (CRL) on shared representations to facilitate knowledge acquisition of clients. Specifically, both local model parameters and averaged values of local representations are considered as shareable information to the server, both of which are then aggregated globally. CRL is applied between local representations and global representations to regularize personalized training by drawing similar representations closer and separating dissimilar ones, thereby enhancing local models with external knowledge and avoiding being harmed by label distribution skew. Additionally, FedCRL adopts local aggregation between each local model and the global model to tackle data scarcity. A loss-wise weighting mechanism is introduced to guide the local aggregation using each local model’s contrastive loss to coordinate the global model involvement in each client, thus helping clients with scarce data. Our simulations demonstrate FedCRL’s effectiveness in mitigating label heterogeneity by achieving accuracy improvements over existing methods on datasets with varying degrees of label heterogeneity.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Empowered by Deep Learning (DL), data-driven learning approaches have gained popularity and demonstrated promise, while requiring substantial training datasets to achieve satisfactory results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, in practice, training data is usually not available for centralization due to privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. As a result, Federated Learning (FL), a distributed paradigm that allows clients to collaboratively train models without centralizing data, has emerged as a prevalent solution. The classical FL algorithm, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, performs well on Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data. However, due to differences in geography and preferences among the devices and users, clients often have non-IID data, also called statistical heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which poses challenges to traditional FL. This paper is motivated to mainly focus on two types of statistical heterogeneity as shown below.</p>
<ul id="S1.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="S1.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Label distribution skew:</span> Label distribution skew refers to the FL situation where the distribution of labels varies significantly across different clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For example, while one client’s data has a lot of samples of one class, another might have very few or none, leading to challenges in training a model that performs well across all clients due to these imbalances in label distribution.</p>

On one hand, the labels of scarce data are sometimes unique and important, such as rare anomalies or surveys of minority groups. The difficulty of integrating the knowledge contained in scarce data into models of other clients leads to unfairness. On the other hand, scarce data is highly susceptible to causing overfitting, impeding normal local training. This usually occurs with monopolized clients or newly participating clients.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, the two types of statistical heterogeneity present significant challenges to FL, demanding prompt and effective solutions. Note that, since we mainly study the effect caused by labels in scarce data, data scarcity is also regarded as a kind of label skew in this paper. Thus, we collectively refer to the above two types of statistical heterogeneity as <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">label heterogeneity</span>. An illustration of the label heterogeneity is shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I-A Background and Motivation ‣ I Introduction ‣ FedCRL: Personalized Federated Learning with Contrastive Shared Representations for Label Heterogeneity in Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with label heterogeneity, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as an extension of traditional FL and received significant attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. PFL tailors personalized models for each client within a collaborative training paradigm to achieve robust performance on heterogeneous datasets. Notably, methods like FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, pFedMe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and Ditto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> have been proven effective as they coordinate the distance between the global model and local models through regularizing the local training objective. Furthermore, a substantial body of research has focused on splitting the model structure into representation layers, serving as a common feature extractor, and projection layers which address specific tasks. Numerous algorithms have been proposed involving splitting the models communicated in FL and then designing hybrid learning strategies, such as FedPer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, LG-FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, FedRep <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Despite these advancements, the above methods only improve clients’ performance through generic model parameters but ignore more fine-grained characteristics inherent in data, especially label distribution skew. On the other hand, recent studies have explored data quantity skew problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, but they have not adequately addressed co-existence of label distribution skew and data scarcity, leaving a research gap.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to the close correlation between data and representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, FedProto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> pioneered the concept of utilizing representations as shareable information without privacy intrusion in FL, thus enhancing personalization through the provision of additional knowledge to clients. Building on this concept, recent studies, such as FedGH <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and FedPAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, have integrated shared representations with the global model to balance the extraction of insights from both models and representations, achieving notable improvements. Nevertheless, a commonality among these methods is their focus on harnessing knowledge from representations with identical labels. More specifically, both FedProto and FedPAC employ regularization by calculating the distance between same-label representations. FedGH uses local representations to supervise the training of global projection layers, also concentrating on the alignment of same-label representations. The limitation in these methods is the lack of collaboration across various labels, which may restrict FL’s generalizability on clients with extreme label distribution skew, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I-A Background and Motivation ‣ I Introduction ‣ FedCRL: Personalized Federated Learning with Contrastive Shared Representations for Label Heterogeneity in Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, hindering the participation of clients with scarce data. In light of this, Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) which emphasizes deriving knowledge from label-agnostic representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, offers a promising perspective. We believe that utilizing shared representations among clients can further contribute to mitigating label heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces a novel PFL approach leveraging CRL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, aiming to address the label heterogeneity caused by label distribution skew and data scarcity in distributed ML scenarios. Leveraging shared representations, we orchestrate the aggregation of local models and local personalized training in a CRL-oriented perspective. During the FL communication, each client uploads local model parameters and the averaged local representations of each label to the server, and downloads globally aggregated model parameters and representations. Local representations are generated by feeding raw data into the representation layers. For example, if a client has data with two labels while totally five labels exist among all clients, this client needs to upload two averaged local representations and download five globally aggregated representations in each FL iteration. Both the architecture-agnostic model parameters and averaged representations will not intrude privacy.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">During the local update, we sequentially conduct local aggregation and local training. To mitigate label distribution skew, CRL is adopted to regularize the local training, fostering similarity among representations with the same label and divergence among those with different labels. The global representations are used to construct positive and negative sample pairs for the local representations. Besides, to coordinate personalization among clients with significant data quantity skew, especially for data-scarce clients, a loss-wise weighting mechanism is introduced for local adaptive aggregation. This mechanism ensures that, when the local model’s contrastive loss is high, indicating its poor capability of distinguishing samples with different labels, the global model contributes more to drive advancement. Conversely, when the local model’s contrastive loss is low, the global model participates less to avoid a compromise on personalization. This mechanism is not affected by overfitting caused by data scarcity, because overfitting only occurs in supervised learning objectives, while contrastive loss is a form of self-supervised learning.</p>

FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and Ditto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> mitigate the impact of heterogeneity by regulating the L2 distance between local models and the global model, while pFedMe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> learns an additional model for each client. To deal with device heterogeneity, PerFedAvg integrates meta learning with FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. However, these methods become less effective with diverse data or numerous clients.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Model splitting has gained traction in FL, and representative works include FedPer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, LG-FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and FedRep <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which split model layers for global aggregation. Besides, exploration into client-tailored aggregations, like FedAMP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and FedALA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, aligns with our method. While effective in managing data heterogeneity, these methods only conduct personalization based on model parameters instead of features inherent in raw data. Notably, in MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, CRL is applied to clients, but only between the local model and global model, neglecting the interactions between clients.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, data quantity skew has been studied by combining few-shot learning and FL. Federated Few-Shot Learning (FedFSL) emerges as a pivotal approach to address few-shot tasks in distributed settings. Initiated by the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, it leverages mutual information and a two-stage adversarial learning for consistent feature space development across local and global models, showcasing effectiveness in data-scarce environments. The work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> further defines FedFSL, focusing on optimizing new task performance with limited samples through meta task formulation. Meanwhile, the works of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> explores model-agnostic FL to bridge domain gaps and enhance data-scarce clients’ knowledge. The work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> integrates relation network into FL to develop a lightweight framework for distributed few-shot image classification. Since scenarios with both label distribution skew and data scarcity have not been considered sufficiently, a research gap is remained.</p>

FedPAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> leverages representations to optimize local classifier combination for a balance between bias and variance. While the above models achieve good performance on heterogeneous data, there remains untapped potential in utilizing shared representations for enhancement. In contrast, our work achieves information enhancement and local aggregation for all clients through CRL on shared representations.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">CRL, an emergent field in self-supervised learning, excels in capturing knowledge from unlabeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Its effectiveness hinges on the principle of minimizing the distance between representations with identical labels (positive pairs) and maximizing that between representations with different labels (negative pairs). Though there exist works of integrating CRL with FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, CRL among shared representations, we believe as a significant perspective, has not been explored. Due to the self-supervised nature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, CRL can deal with data scarcity in FL by extracting features from small-dataset clients. Since the distinctiveness of data has yet not been adequately considered in FL communications, CRL is promising to bridge this gap by guiding models to learn distinctive and fine-grained features from small datasets, while maintaining coherence with the global model. Thus, we propose FedCRL by learning knowledge from both model parameters and representations in this work.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The reason for choosing the contrastive loss as the basis for weighting, rather than the supervised loss, is that the contrastive loss directly reflects the model’s ability to distinguish among multiple samples with different labels. On the other hand, although the supervised loss can reflect the model’s recognition capability for individual samples, it tends to result in severe overfitting in clients with scarce data, leading to low training loss but poor predictive performance. Therefore, using the contrastive loss can objectively reflect the capability of each local model without being affected by data scarcity.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Before conducting experiments, we provide a theoretical analysis of the developed FedCRL algorithm. Firstly, we focus on the effectiveness of the local loss function incorporating cross entropy and InfoNCE, as the local training is the core part of the personalization of FedCRL. We explain that minimizing InfoNCE in FedCRL aims to maximize the mutual information between the local representations and global representations, thus enhancing the knowledge of each local model. Secondly, both global model aggregation and local model aggregation linearly change the model parameters, which may cause deviations in the loss expectation during each iteration. If the deviation is unbounded, the convergence of FedCRL may not be guaranteed. Therefore, we characterize the overall communication between the server and the clients to establish an upper bound on the loss expectation deviation, thereby ensuring the convergence of FedCRL. Note that due to the non-convexity of the local loss induced by InfoNCE, we focus on non-convex settings. Morevoer, we also present the relationship between the convergence rate and key hyperparameters.</p>

The reason is that, according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, if the labels are fully reliable, the lower bound of the mutual information between positive pairs estimated by InfoNCE will be tighter when the number of negative samples is larger, which usually contributes to model performance improvements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Thus, we can conclude that FedCRL is more effective in tackling heterogeneity, particularly in scenarios with a larger number of label classes.</p>

Though several methods, such as FedPer and FedRep, achieve higher convergence at the beginning, after a short period of fluctuation, FedCRL demonstrates an upward trend in accuracy, while others exhibit a prolonged decline in accuracy overtime. This advantage of consistent learning can be attributed to the knowledge enhancement provided by CRL. Although the convergence speed of various algorithms is similar, FedCRL exhibits more stable trends in both accuracy and loss curves with stability kept by the local adaptive aggregation.</p>

We find that most PFL methods achieve better performance in more heterogeneous settings, with our FedCRL consistently ranking in the top three. An interesting trend is that almost all methods degrade in accuracy but achieve improved stability when the heterogeneity becomes moderate. This can be attributed to the reduced performance gap between clients with abundant data and those with scarce data, when the setting becomes less heterogeneous. Thus, the fairness among clients tends to be poorer, though the overall performance is high on datasets with considerable heterogeneity. Specifically, FedPAC is not applicable on practical CIFAR-10 with <math id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta=0.01" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">β</mi><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">0.01</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝛽</ci><cn type="float" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">0.01</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1c">\beta=0.01</annotation></semantics></math>, whose optimization problem among clients may not have feasible solutions due to the extreme scarcity of label classes.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To study the fairness of FedCRL compared with other methods, we examine the standard deviations in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-B1 Effectiveness ‣ V-B Performance Comparisons ‣ V Experiments and Discussion ‣ FedCRL: Personalized Federated Learning with Contrastive Shared Representations for Label Heterogeneity in Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> and Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ V-B2 Scalability ‣ V-B Performance Comparisons ‣ V Experiments and Discussion ‣ FedCRL: Personalized Federated Learning with Contrastive Shared Representations for Label Heterogeneity in Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. In all experiments, FedCRL consistently ranks in the top three for fairness, indicating that most client groups guided by FedCRL exhibit smaller difference. For traditional FL, FedProx and Ditto are often the fairest methods since they focus more on generalization over personalization. Besides, PFL methods, such as FedRep and PerFedAvg, also exhibit reasonably good fairness, because they conduct both global update and local update to balance the two ends. FedCRL finds a better balance between generalization and personalization than other methods, thus leading to both high accuracy and fairness. The above observations validate FedCRL’s capability of helping clients with scarce data and mitigating divergence among clients, demonstrating its applicability in distributed scenarios with significantly diverse labels.</p>

This visualization shows that FedCRL exhibits significantly more distinctive and effective learning compared to FedAvg, as it facilitates the representations to gather into separate clusters of uniform colors. This enhanced clustering effect is indicates the strength of shared representations in aiding the global model to more effectively learn and capture the unique characteristics of the data. FedCRL’s capability to differentiate between the data inputs from different clients in such a visually distinct manner underscores its superiority in handling data heterogeneity.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our work presents FedCRL, a novel PFL technique, aiming to address label distribution skew and data scarcity. Utilizing CRL with shared representations, FedCRL effectively handles label heterogeneity. It enhances local model training by leveraging global representations to form sample pairs, enriching clients’ knowledge, especially those with limited data. The proposed loss-wise weighting model aggregation dynamically balances local and global models, ensuring personalized performance. Experiments show that FedCRL outperforms existing methods in various heterogeneous settings, showing its effectiveness with diverse or scarce data. In future work, we will study the potential of CRL on other statistical heterogeneity, including feature condition skew, where clients exhibit similar label distributions but distinct sample distributions, as well as quality skew with varying levels of data noise for clients.</p>
