<p id="id32.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) since proposed has been applied in many fields, such as credit assessment, medical, etc. Because of the difference in the network or computing resource, the clients may not update their gradients at the same time that may take a lot of time to wait or idle. That’s why Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) method is needed. The main bottleneck in AFL is communication. How to find a balance between the model performance and the communication cost is a challenge in AFL. This paper proposed a novel AFL framework VAFL. And we verified the performance of the algorithm through sufficient experiments. The experiments show that VAFL can reduce the communication times about 51.02% with 48.23% average communication compression rate and allow the model to be converged faster. The code is available at <span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter ltx_ref_self">https://github.com/RobAI-Lab/VAFL</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning and artificial intelligence need to be fed lots of data to get a well-performed model, which cased the demand of data that is stored in every device. For instance, smart city<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, medical<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and credit assessment<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. But, this data is sensitive. At the same time, the relationship between data is often isolated and fragmented. This limits its application for processing data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this context, federated learning was proposed. Federated learning is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning technique. The data holders only need to provide a local model which was trained using their local data to interact with the central server. In this paradigm, only gradients need to be transmitted rather than the raw data, which can effectively reduce privacy risks. In federated learning, the client downloads the global model from the central server and trains the local data under the coordination of the central server. After a round of training is completed, the trained local model is uploaded to the central server for weighted aggregation to complete the update. After some iterations, the performance of the model is similar to the results of centralized machine learning. However, there are some challenges in federated learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Traditional federated learning has obvious shortcomings in flexibility and scalability. These challenges are shown below:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Heterogeneous device: Since training data is stored on the client-side, heterogeneous device client used to have different data sizes, computing power, network, etc., and are affected by unstable communication conditions, the efficiency of traditional synchronous federated learning can be affected by the presence of dropped users. For example, when a few clients are disconnected due to network problems, other clients and server have to wait for them, causing the federated learning process slowly and spend lots of time idle.</p>

To address the first challenge, we consider the number of participating clients and provide an improved method for judging clients by checking obsolescence, introducing a function for evaluating the communication value of clients so that random selection is no longer performed. By selecting high-quality clients, the global model accuracy is improved. For the second challenge, we make a division between IID and Non-IID on the datasets, aiming to cope with practical federated learning scenarios, and explore applications in Non-IID environments.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the Federated Learning framework proposed by Google has attracted great attention from academic scholars. The standard federated learning model needs to learn a single global statistical model from the stored data of a large number of remote devices. However, the standard model faces challenges such as high communication costs, system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and privacy issues<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these challenges, McMahan<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>proposed a method for synchronous training of the Federated learning Average Algorithm (FedAvg), and recently Q Li<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed MOON based on FedAvg. These algorithms are updated locally. The cost of communication is reduced; not only that, privacy protection is based on synchronization operations such as differential privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>and secure aggregation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> can solve the privacy problem to a certain extent.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, many types of research on federated learning today are mainly about Non-IID data sets and data imbalances, and most of the researches are based on synchronization algorithms. However, federated learning based on synchronization algorithms cannot solve the problem of excessive communication costs. Issues such as differences in terminal performance due to different equipment terminals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In response to the above challenges, many researchers have begun to try asynchronous algorithms for federated learning. For example, EAFLM proposed by Lu<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, this method can achieve the goal of reducing communication costs without searching for the optimal solution; SS Diwangkara<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>implemented it through an asynchronous aggregation algorithm The rapid convergence of each node and the reduction of the update frequency of the parameters can not only reduce the communication cost, but the method also achieves good results in the Non-IID data set. Although the above methods can reduce the communication cost better, they did not consider the serious delay caused by the lagging party. For this reason, McMahan B<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed the use of multiple SGD updates and batch processing clients to alleviate the delay. Problem; Subsequently, Nishio T<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> suggested using the deadline method to solve the customer selection problem. Although this method can filter out some slow-response customers, it did not consider how to solve the model accuracy rate caused by the backwardness in training. Too low customers, for this reason, Chai<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a hierarchical-based federated learning system (TIFL), which can divide customers into different levels according to the user’s response delay in the federated system. To select customers based on the system, the system can not only solve the problem of the user falling behind but also further alleviate the problem of Non-IID data. However, the TIFL system adaptively adjusts the client’s participation based on the response delay of the client’s machine, and it cannot solve some clients with high participation but low data quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Aiming at the excessively high communication cost in the federated learning training and the lagging customers, we propose an optimized federated learning asynchronous algorithm based on the communication value calculation of the gradient, the number of clients, and the accuracy of the model(VAFL). Different from the method of Chai<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, we use the client’s gradient change, the accuracy rate on the test set, and the number of clients to evaluate the client’s communication value, thereby determining whether the client can continue to participate in federated optimization. At the same time, considering the problem of low performance of client devices in reality, when we set up the experimental platform, we used a Raspberry Pi with poor performance to simulate client devices.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper. We proposed VAFL, a federated learning algorithm, focusing on the limitation and imbalance of the communication in asynchronous federated learning. The main idea of VAFL is that we expect to evaluate the communication values of each client to decide whether each one of them can participate in the optimization to compress communication values between server and clients. This study has designed a series of experiments aimed to identify the algorithm improving the efficiency of federated learning of edge devices compared with general algorithms and EAFLM, but also including some deficiencies.</p>
