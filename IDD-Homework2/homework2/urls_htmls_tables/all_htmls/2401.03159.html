<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an emerging distributed machine learning framework in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In IoV, millions of vehicles are willing to train the model to share their knowledge. Maintaining an active state means the participants must update their state to the FL server in a fixed interval and participate to next round. However, the cost by maintaining an active state is very large when there are a huge number of participating vehicles. In this paper, we proposed a distributed client selection scheme to reduce the cost of maintaining the active state for all participants. The clients with the highest evaluation are elected among the neighbours. In the evaluator, four variables are considered including sample quantity, throughput available, computational capability and the quality of the local dataset. We adopted fuzzy logic as the evaluator since the closed-form solution over four variables does not exist. Extensive simulation results show our proposal approximates the centralized client selection in terms of accuracy and can significantly reduce the communication overhead.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the past years, federated learning assisted Internet of vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have been received widespread attention from academia and industry because federated learning as a distributed machine learning framework, can achieve the purpose of exchanging knowledge cross the user through sharing training models and avoid the leakage of the privacy, without uploading raw data related to user privacy to the server. In the framework, millions of client devices owning local datasets collected by terminal equipment are willing to participate in training. For example, in the GBoard (a keyboard for tablets and smartphones developed by Google Inc.), over 1.5 million clients are chosen for the learning language model in the whole process of federated training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Also, in FL-assisted vehicular networks, there are over 3 million vehicles in the active state in the Kanto area, Japan. Because of the wireless bandwidth limitation, a small fraction of the users are only chosen as the client for learning in each round. The server is responsible for client selection in the classical federated learning framework. Hence, all participants willing to train the model must update their state as alive in the fixed interval. In general, as mentioned in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, the user device must meet some conditions, including dataset freshness and size, charging, idle wireless connection, operating system version and hardware requirements. In general, in the FL-assisted vehicular networks, the vehicle states can include the location, network environment and running state, such as the velocity and the acceleration. These states need to update the server over wireless connection promptly. Compared to the uploading model, the overhead of updating the state from all participants to the server is not negligible since millions of participants need to update the state at any time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most classical federated learning frameworks adopt a centralized control scheme when the server selects the clients for the learning. The server is responsible for collecting and updating the active state of all participants. And then, the server chooses a set of participants with active states as training clients at the beginning of a new communication round. Undoubtedly, the overhead that occurred by updating the state is huge while the number of participants is tremendous. These overheads occupy precious wireless resources and increase communication delays, and even most are useless. As the conclusion in work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, selecting a small fraction of devices in each round can also achieve good performance. Unfortunately, most researchers did not consider the overhead from updating the state of all participants. They only proposed a framework adapting decentralized client selection by updating the active state of all participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The server has to transfer the authority of selecting the clients to the clients because the server in the distributed framework will no longer accept the message about the participants for the evaluation. Meanwhile, the assessment of all participants is moved from the server to the local. Each participant assesses himself according to the input parameters, such as sample quantity, network throughput, computational capability and the diversity of the local dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The fundamental differences between centralized client selection and distributed client schemes are described as follows. The first difference is whether the information of all participants for evaluation is collected on the server side. The second difference is whether the server has the power to select clients. Furthermore, assessing the participant is processed locally instead of on the server. Most of the traditional federated learning frameworks are developed on the centralized scheme. Hence, the overhead of updating information is very large and can not be eliminated. On the contrary, the distributed framework with client selection can eliminate the overhead smoothly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the federated learning-assisted vehicular networks, selecting some vehicles with good performances in each round can effectively speed up the convergence of the model. For example, a client with a larger training dataset, with stronger computational capability, higher network throughput, and the loss function of the local dataset can ensure that the client model is successfully uploaded to the central server. Thus, global model accuracy is improved while more local models participate in aggregation. However, a close-form solution considering the influencing factors does not exist and brings a huge challenge to evaluating the participating vehicle. To this end, we adopt a lightweight evaluating approach, fuzzy logic based client evaluator, that can utilize the fuzzy relationship between influencing factors to construct an assessment approach for the participants.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the past years, researchers paid attention to a bottleneck in the communication cost between the server and the client for exchanging models in the FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. To mitigate the communication cost, researchers proposed some solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, including gradient and model compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, biased client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, reinforcement learning based client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, learning on edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and so on. So far, all federated learning framework is based on centralized client selection in which the FL server is in charge of the client selection process and selecting information about all participants must be gathered by the FL server to maintain the active state of the participants. In fact, millions of participants are willing to the training in the federated learning. Hence, the communication overhead caused by maintaining the active state for all participants is <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FAR LARGER</span> than the communication overhead caused by exchanging the model between the FL server and the client. Unfortunately, most researchers did not pay attention to the overhead by maintaining the active state. Although, hierarchical federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> can mitigate the communication overhead from maintaining the active state of all participants, the centralized client selection framework does not eliminate the overhead. In regret that the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> did not consider the overhead that the participant maintains the active state.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The decentralized federated learning (DFL) framework is widely discussed, in which aggregating server does not need, and the training model of each client is sent to all other clients. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> considered a DFL based on peer-to-peer communication to serve medical applications. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> considered a DFL framework using the committee consensus blockchain and all models, including the global model from the server and the local model from the client are stored in the blockchain. In the same way, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> also considered an asynchronous DFL framework based on blockchain to enhance the stability and reliability during model transmission in the IoV. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> proposed decentralized federated learning based on blockchain for the vehicular network and analyzed the advantages from the perspective of the theory. In addition, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> developed an approach, which updates the model according to the connection state, even partially received the model, to suit unreliable networks. The DFL framework mentioned above is very suitable for the dynamics network environment, such as vehicular networks with mobility. However, the size of exchanging model among all clients increased exponentially with the number of participants. For example, exchanging model size is very huge in the IoV owning millions of vehicles. In addition, these DFL frameworks only consider uploading models between all clients, and the communication cost occurred by maintaining the active state of all participants needs to be addressed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the centralized client selection framework, in the distributed client selection, the server would not gather all participant information. And the client evaluation /selection is removed out from the server. For the client selection, it can be classified as biased client selection and unbiased client selection, respectively. Unbiased client selection does not consider any factors, for example, random selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, in which all participants have the same chance to be selected as the client. In contrast, biased client selection selects the client according to some sorting. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> systematically summarized the opportunities and challenges in the client selection process and highlighted the importance of system and data heterogeneity to client selection. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> investigated most of the existing works involving system architecture, application, privacy concerns as well as resource management. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> summarized the taxonomy and challenges of the client selection in terms of fairness to create an incentive for the sustainability of the FL ecosystem. Similarly, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> developed a novel global model aggregation algorithm, which considered group fairness instead of the weight related to the sample quantity in the local. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> choose the client with a larger loss function to speed up the convergence. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> jointly consider wireless resource allocation and client selection from a long-term perspective. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> consider multiple criteria, such as computational capability, memory and energy, in the client selection to maximize the successful ratio of the uploading model. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed an asynchronous federated learning, in which deep reinforcement learning (DRL) resided on the server selects the nodes with higher communication and computation resources for the training. The local model is uploaded to the blockchain instead of the server. In the same way, the global model is also distributed to the blockchain. Finally, in the aggregation, the server retrieves from the blockchain to aggregate the global model after the local training. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> considered the client selection from efficiency and fairness. In complex networks, such as federated learning assisted Internet of vehicular, the approaches mentioned above still faced challenges because of the heterogeneity of the client. To this end, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a client selection considering multi-objective evaluation. Unfortunately, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is based on the centralized client selection framework and did not eliminate the communication overhead.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The heterogeneity among clients is a key challenge in federated learning, including statistical and system heterogeneity. The heterogeneity not only dropped the accuracy but also slowed the convergence speed. To address the statistical heterogeneity, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> added a proximal term to the local objective function to reduce the gradient drift. However, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> did not consider the system heterogeneity. For example, a connection is broken by vehicle mobility in IoV. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> jointly considered node selection and wireless resource allocation in the heterogeneous FL system to maximize loss function decay and accelerate the convergence. To address the non-i.i.d of the dataset, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> adopted a support vector machine (SVM) to detect the feature of samples and remove the useless samples. SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> corrected the direction of the update by the difference between the global model and the local model. Prior works provide important references in terms of the theory and method. Unfortunately, these works lack the combination with the real world.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the critical challenges of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are that system heterogeneity, model performance and user privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. System heterogeneity refers to the resources, such as computational capability, available network resources, as well as training datasets owned by each vehicle running on the road, which differ from other vehicles. In general, these resources vary with the vehicle state as well. For example, a vehicle parking on the lot has more resources compared to a vehicle fast driving on the highway in terms of computational capability and training dataset. In the same way, available network resource varies with vehicle movement, while the vehicle move in and out continuously from the signal coverage of the roadside unit (RSU) located aside the road. The model performance worsens drastically when the network environment changes with the vehicle’s mobility. The model having stable and high safety is important for safeguarding passengers and pedestrians. The privacy concern for the vehicle, such as trajectory and traffic context, not only affects the driving experience, it can even endanger the life of pedestrians.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the CFL, the FL server collects the local model from the clients and then aggregates into the global model using the federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, all states regarding the participant are collected in the FL server for selecting clients. On the contrary, in the DFL, the functions of the server are placed into all clients, including broadcast model, uploading model to other clients and aggregating model. Hence, the role of the server is removed from FL. Compared with CFL, DFL is suitable for dynamic networks and has scalability and robustness. However, in the DFL, wasting precious network resources exists because a model is transmitted multiple times among the clients.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Following, we discuss three client selection schemes, as shown in Fig <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4.1 Different client selection schemes ‣ 4 Distributed client selection framework ‣ Distributed client selection with multi-objective in federated learning assisted Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, specifically, client selection in CFL, client selection in CFL-fuzzy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and distributed client selection, respectively. In the CFL,
the whole states of each vehicle are collected to the FL server and then execute the following steps, assessment, sort, selection, broadcast global model to all clients, local training, uploading local model as well as aggregation, as shown in the Fig. <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4.1 Different client selection schemes ‣ 4 Distributed client selection framework ‣ Distributed client selection with multi-objective in federated learning assisted Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>a. The FL server in the CFL plays the role of coordinator. For the client selection in the CFL-fuzzy, the assessment of each participant is processed locally and then updated to the FL server. Next, the following steps are run, sort, selection, broadcast global model to all clients, local training, uploading local model and aggregation, as shown in the Fig. <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4.1 Different client selection schemes ‣ 4 Distributed client selection framework ‣ Distributed client selection with multi-objective in federated learning assisted Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>b. In the distributed client selection, the global model is broadcast to all participants at the start of each round, and the assessment is processed on the local. And then, the evaluation is exchanged among the neighbours and selects the client. Next, the selected client trains the model over on the local dataset and uploads their local model to the FL server. Finally, the FL server aggregates all local models received from the clients, as shown in the Fig. <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4.1 Different client selection schemes ‣ 4 Distributed client selection framework ‣ Distributed client selection with multi-objective in federated learning assisted Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>c.

The characteristic of distributed client selection is that selecting client adopts the distributed scheme as aggregating model adopts the centralized scheme. Furthermore, the FL server can not know which participants are selected as the client. The scheme can minimize the overhead caused by maintaining the active state of all participants while keeping the high efficiency of centralized aggregation.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the FL system, the communication overhead comprises two parts, the overhead by exchanging models and the overhead by maintaining the active state of all participants. In the dynamic network (e.g. IoV), the participant’s state needs to be constantly updated to the coordinator, such as the FL server, because the resources vary with time continuously and notice to the coordinator that a participant is still alive. The state changes may increase the chance of being selected as a client. So, all participants update the active state to be chosen as a client by the server. In general, the size of maintaining an active state is far larger than the size of exchanging model when millions of participants exist in the FL system. Following, we analyze a real example from Gboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to compare the two kinds of overhead. We choose transmitted data size as a comparing metric.

In comparison, the uploading model size is only 0.41 Giga Byte. The size of maintaining the active state of all
decreases with the interval increase. Two curves, CFL and CFL-fuzzy, crossed with the uploading model size curve at 52 seconds and 15 seconds, respectively. However, in a dynamic network, such as IoV, some clients with poor performance are selected and dropped down the model convergence and even cause the traffic accident because the state of vehicles can not be updated in such an interval. The distributed client selection framework proposed can achieve low communication overhead and updating interval of the active state.</p>

Those variables can be obtained locally. Considering the non-existence of the closed-form solution over the four variables mentioned above, we adopt fuzzy logic as the evaluator, named fuzzy evaluator.

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We consider reliable transmitting protocols, such as transmission control protocol (TCP), used as exchanging model protocol to upload the local model to the FL server.

<div id="S5.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The available throughput of the participating vehicles varies with the mobility of the vehicles. In practice, precisely predicting throughput is necessary for each participant when the fuzzy evaluator assesses the participating vehicle. To predict the throughput available, the sender’s congestion control (CWND_SND) window size in the TCP (RENO) is used to approximate the throughput of the participants. The assumptions are that every participating vehicle plays the sender’s role in sending the data to the FL server, and the history record of CWND_SND is stored in the sender when the data are transmitted. The available throughput of the participating vehicles achieves by averaging the CWND_SND values within a certain period.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The clarification is that the value of available throughput need not be exact, and obtained value meets some criteria that keep order relatively. In other words, the order of predicted throughput of the participating vehicles also keeps the order in terms of the real throughput in the real world. Since the evaluator only requires sorting the participating vehicles by the available throughput. In the real world, because of user privacy, collecting the information from both sender and receiver is impossible to predict the throughput. The congestion window size can reflect the variety of available throughput while the network environment changes with mobility.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fuzzy logic is an approach that does not need a close-form solution over considering the variables and can obtain the list of the output values. Having the characteristic of the lightweight, fuzzy logic run on the participating vehicles. We considered four input variables, specifically, sample quantity, throughput available, computational capability, and loss function of the dataset, which are related to the uploading model success rate as well as the contribution of the global model. These input variables are essential to evaluate whether a participating vehicle is “good” or “bad” for the FL. The reasons are listed as follows. On the one hand, the distance between the vehicle and BS/RSU varies with the time domain, and the throughput also fluctuates. Similarly, the computational capability is also frequently changed over time. The two input variables above are the main factor affecting the uploading model’s success rate. On the other hand, the dataset with more samples contributes more to the convergence. Meanwhile, in the FL with the non-i.i.d feature, the diversity of the dataset across the participating vehicles can accelerate the convergence and be measured by the loss function. The greater the loss function, the more the diversity of dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the sample quantity and the loss function are introduced to measure the quality of the dataset. Following, we present the input variables and its description.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sample quantity (SQ)</span>: The convergence can be accelerated when more samples are trained in machine learning. Similarly to FL, the client with more samples participates in the FL, speeding up the convergence. Hence, the participant with more samples should be selected as the client to join the FL. Considering the number of clients, selecting as many clients as possible is equivalent to training more samples in the round. However, the number of clients must be restricted because of the bandwidth limitation. Selecting a client with more samples is more efficient than the method that selects many clients. Therefore, the fuzzy evaluator uses the sample quantity as an input variable. The value of the sample quantity is normalized into [0, 1]. And then, the normalization is mapped into three levels, sufficient, average, and shortage, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.3 Fuzzy evaluator with multi-objective ‣ 5 Multi-objective evaluator ‣ Distributed client selection with multi-objective in federated learning assisted Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>a.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A realistic wireless vehicular network simulator is integrated with OMNeT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, simuLTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, SUMO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and Pytorch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. The number of vehicles is 30, and all vehicles are running on a straight road with 1000 m in length and follow the free-way model. Each vehicle has two communication interfaces: cellular and DSRC (like the IEEE 802.11p interface). In the network, multiple base stations are located uniformly on the map, allocating wireless resources to the vehicle. Wireless resources are allocated to up/downlink streams identically. The available throughput of the participating vehicle reaches 10.4 Mbps when enjoying the highest modulation coding scheme (MCS) and the whole wireless resources. On the contrary, the available throughput only reaches 0.24 Mbps under the lowest MCS and the whole wireless resources. The evaluation of the participating vehicle is broadcast to the neighbouring vehicles over the IEEE 802.11p interface in a fixed interval. Each participating vehicle needs to maintain a table which stores the evaluation of the neighbour in the specific range. Furthermore, the content of the table is also updated in fixed intervals. To avoid the occurrence of stragglers, the deadline of the communication round is introduced in the simulator and set to 20 seconds. The local model received after the deadline is discarded.</p>

The local dataset of each vehicle can come from multiple classes which own identical quantity samples. These vehicles have an unbalanced dataset. For example, the vehicle’s id numbered from 0 to 11 have about 4500 samples, while other vehicle’s id numbered from 12 to 29 are only owning about 45 samples.

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of the proposal, we consider multiple benchmarks, specifically, centralized client selection (CCS) and centralized client selection with fuzzy logic (CCS-fuzzy) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. CCS means that all information involving the active states of the client needs to be transmitted to the FL server, and the FL server is in charge of the client selection. Random client selection is a typical CCS scheme. CCS-fuzzy refers that the fuzzy evaluation to assess the client is moved from the FL server to the participating vehicles and uploaded to the FL server after evaluation. DCS refers to selecting a client which does not rely on the FL server. The evaluation of the participant is exchanged among the neighbours over DSRC communication. And then, these nodes elect some nodes with the highest evaluation to be acted as the clients for uploading the model.</p>

The two curves of CCS-fuzzy and the proposed scheme overlapped in the final stage, while DCS largely jitters in the initial step. In conclusion, DCS can achieve the same level as CCS-fuzzy.

<p id="S6.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The distribution of participating vehicles can impact the performance of DCS because DCS can select the optimal client in the neighbouring small area. To illustrate the case, we design two distributions for participating vehicles, including uniform distribution and extreme distribution, respectively. In uniform distribution, all vehicles are distributed randomly. In the extreme distribution, the vehicles with better evaluation are crowded in one small area, while the remaining vehicles with poor evaluation are crowded in another small area. In Fig. <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 6.2 Evaluation ‣ 6 Simulation and evaluation ‣ Distributed client selection with multi-objective in federated learning assisted Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the results are illustrated the performance involving CCS-fuzzy, DCS with uniform distribution and DCS with extreme distribution.

The number of selected clients in the uniform distribution is averaged at 5.05, while the number of selected clients in the extreme distribution is 6 as a constant.

The reason is described as follows. The vehicles with better evaluation are more likely to be selected as the client in the uniform distribution. On the contract, the vehicles with better evaluation are crowded in the small, leading to “cut-throat competition” in the extreme distribution. Hence, a small number of vehicles with better evaluation are selected as the client and pulled down the convergence speed.</p>

The convergence speed accelerates when the characteristics of the dataset are approaching from non-i.i.d to i.i.d. Because the non-i.i.d dataset increases the weight shifting in training. In the special case, such as without the intersection between the datasets, the accuracy can not meet the requirements and even can not converge, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 6.2 Evaluation ‣ 6 Simulation and evaluation ‣ Distributed client selection with multi-objective in federated learning assisted Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>c.

We adopt the accumulated consumed time as a metric, the sum of time each participant consumed on the communication. We adopt Tokyo region as an example to analyze the communication overhead. According to the statistics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, by 2021, the number of registered motor vehicles reached 3.09 million in Tokyo region, Japan. In each communication round, 1, 000 vehicles are elected as the client. We consider that the sum of the total time consumed in communication, including exchanging the model and maintaining the active state of the vehicles.

The dashed line represents the consumed time for exchanging the model.

First, compared to exchanging model, the cost caused by maintaining an active state can not be neglected when the number of participants increases drastically. This conclusion is ignored by most of the prior researchers. Second, accumulated consumed time decreases with the increase of sending interval, but maintaining an active state also consumes enormous time and energy in the CCS and CCS-fuzzy. In addition, the time consumed by DCS is less than CCS and CCS-fuzzy. The reasons are as follows. The vehicle-to-vehicle latency using DSRC communication is smaller than the latency from the vehicle to the cloud. Additionally, the multi-objective evaluator running on the local not only compresses the whole information but protected privacy by avoiding sending the whole information involving the vehicle to the neighbours. Finally, broadcasting evaluation is restricted in each small area, such as the range of 200 meters, and reduces the communication overhead.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel client selection scheme, namely distributed client selection, in which the FL server is not in charge of the client selection and does not gather information involving the participating vehicles. Furthermore, we proposed an evaluator with multi-objective, which run on each participating vehicle to obtain the evaluation of itself. In the evaluator, we considered four variables related to successfully uploading ratio and local dataset quality, specifically, sample quantity, throughput available, computational capability and loss function of the local dataset. Considering the non-existence of closed-form solutions over the four variables mentioned above, we developed fuzzy logic as the evaluator. Extensive simulations are conducted and verified the proposed scheme approached centralized client selection approximately. Meanwhile, the proposal cut down the communication overhead caused by maintaining the active state of all participating vehicles.</p>
