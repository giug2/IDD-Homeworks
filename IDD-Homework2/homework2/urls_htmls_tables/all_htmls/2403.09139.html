<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">A connectional brain template (CBT) is a holistic representation of a population of multi-view brain connectivity graphs, encoding shared patterns and normalizing typical variations across individuals. The federation of CBT learning allows for an inclusive estimation of representative center of multi-domain brain connectivity datasets in a fully data-preserving manner. However, existing methods overlook the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IDD) issue stemming from multi-domain brain connectivity heterogeneity, in which data domains are drawn from different hospitals and imaging modalities. This non-IDD issue degrades the centrality of locally learned CBT from multiple decentralized datasets (i.e., domains/hospitals), eventually leading to a limited representation ability.
To overcome this limitation, we unprecedentedly propose a metadata-driven federated learning framework, called <span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span>, for cross-domain CBT learning. Given the data drawn from a specific domain (i.e., hospital), our model aims to learn a metadata <em id="id6.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">in a fully supervised manner</em> by introducing a local client-based regressor network. The generated meta-data is forced to meet the statistical attributes (e.g., mean) of <em id="id6.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">other</em> domains, while preserving their privacy. Our supervised meta-data generation approach boosts the unsupervised learning of a more centered and representative and holistic CBT of a particular brain state across diverse domains. As the federated learning progresses over multiple rounds, the learned metadata and associated generated connectivities are are continuously updated to better approximate the target domain information.
<span id="id6.id1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> overcomes the non-IID issue of existing methods by generating informative brain connectivities for privacy-preserving holistic CBT learning with the guidance using metadata.
Extensive experiments on multi-view <span id="id6.id1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">morphological</span> brain networks of normal and patient subjects demonstrate that our <span id="id6.id1.6" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> is a superior federated CBT learning model and significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">A connectional brain template (CBT) is the representative center of a population of multi-view brain connectivities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
It plays a vital role in understanding the patterns of brain connectivity across different subjects and imaging modalities in health and disease <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> since it can provide a connectional representation that is well-centered, discriminative, and topologically sound of a particular brain state (e.g., healthy or disordered). A straightforward solution to constructing a CBT is linear averaging, which is, however, unable to capture the nonlinear complex variability across subjects and views (or modalities).
Graph representation depicts complex multi-subject multi-view brain connectivities. Specifically, by representing brain connectivities as graphs, one can leverage powerful graph-learning techniques to estimate CBTs from populations of brain graphs.
For instance, multigraph integration methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> are employed to fuse the multi-view connectivity data into a single-view representation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its recent advances, CBT learning is still a challenging task, especially when dealing with a large scale of multi-domain (i.e., multi-center) data collected from different sources. This is mainly due to the privacy issue associated with multi-domain medical data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
To address this challenge, recent efforts have been dedicated to tackle multi-domain CBT learning using powerful federated learning (FL) techniques, which learn from multiple distributed hospitals without accessing the data stored in these centers. A typical FL technique is FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which trains distributed models independently on each data owner (a.k.a. client). The trained models are sent to a central server, which aggregates the updates for training the global model. This “server-client” paradigm has significant advantages over traditional centralized learning, especially in settings where data privacy and security are of utmost importance, such as healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The first attempt at federating the learning of CBT is Fed-CBT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which combines FedAvg with a multi-view graph integration method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Fed-CBT employs a baseline FL algorithm to learn a CBT by federating the deep graph normalizer (DGN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> architecture across participating hospitals trained on their local multiv-view datasets. As such, the learned CBT captures shared connectivity patterns across multi-source data in a holistic way with higher communication efficiency. Although making significant progress in cross-domain CBT learning, Fed-CBT suffers from a number of challenges, the major one lies in the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Metadata-Driven Federated Learning of Connectional Brain Templates in Non-IID Multi-Domain Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
The non-IID data have different statistical properties across different domains (i.e., hospitals), such as different data distributions, feature spaces, or label spaces. In practice, the brain connectivity data collected at different hospitals are non-IID due to the inherent heterogeneity in acquisition protocols and population characteristics, as well as imaging modality (e.g., T1-w MRI, diffusion MRI). Each hospital brings a unique domain-specific representative to the cohort of brain connectivities, capturing specific aspects of the complex brain graph architecture. The non-IID nature of the data leads to challenges in generalization, where the locally learned CBTs may lack global representativeness or even diverge during the training process. This hinders the ability to capture the true variable and shared patterns of brain connectivity across diverse populations and undermines the overall effectiveness of the CBT learning model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">metadata-driven domain-generation FL</em> framework, called <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span>, to learn a CBT from non-IID brain connectivities, which are drawn from disparate domains (i.e., hospitals). In a multi-hospital scenario, a hospital-specific learned CBT is fully agnostic to the data of other hospitals, which limits its centerdness and representativeness to only its local data distribution.
Our goal is to learn a universal CBT that approximates a global center across various brain connectivity types (e.g., functional and morphological) or domains without data sharing.
To alleviate the cross-domain heterogeneity problem, we improve the generalization of the local model (trained at each hospital) by boosting the data diversity of each hospital using a custom strategy of supervised meta-domain data generation.
This lies in the assumption that <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">if a hospital learns how to predict the distribution of other centers, it can contribute better to generating a more representative template of multi-view brain graphs</em>.
Particularly, we analyze this distributional information from round-by-round exchanged weights between global (at the server level) and local models (at the hospital/client level).
In other words, the aggregated FL global model carries multiple domain information that can be directly accessed by clients during the communication of model weight parameters without data sharing.
Specifically, we introduce the concept of metadata to represent such an unseen latent space, namely <em id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">meta-domain</em>, by defining the metadata as the key statistical attributes of a meta-domain (e.g., mean and standard deviation values).
The brain connectivity graphs follow a normal distribution, allowing statistical information to guide the generation of a new sample (i.e., brain graph). Specifically, we <em id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">supervisedly</em> predict the metadata using a distribution regressor with the network residuals (i.e., the difference between global and local model weights). Our designed regressor maps the network residuals (i.e., the difference between global and local model weights) onto the metadata (i.e., statistics of data at the meta-domain). The resulting metadata is then used to generate high-quality multi-view connectivity data (i.e., multigraphs) by the trained generator. The connectivities are locally generated and then utilized to improve the quality of the learned CBT.
This two-step “FL + data generation” approach is iteratively conducted to learn a powerful global FL model for improving federated CBT learning. The details of our regressor training strategy are detailed in the Method Section.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of CBT learning is to fuse several brain connection networks that were obtained from various neuroimaging modalities or brain perspectives (e.g., structural and functional views) into a single integrated graph. In a more abstract way, note that this is an unsupervised learning task where we set out to learn a latent center of a highly heterogeneous multimodal population of multigraphs. It can also be expressed as a multimodal/multiview graph integration or fusion task.
The CBT aligns brain networks based on connectivity patterns, which can be mapped using multigraph integration approaches.
For instance, Dhifallah et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> proposed a clustering-based unsupervised multi-view fusion network, called SCA for CBT learning by fusing different views of each subject into one view and then clustering these views based on the similarity of their mapped connectivity patterns.
Further, Dhifallah et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> built a higher-order graph of ROIs across views that captures the variability in connectivity patterns across individuals, then selects the most central connection tensor with a graph-based feature selection method.
NetNorm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is an advanced unsupervised CBT learning method, but might cause the accumulation of errors in the estimation pipeline due to independent learning steps.
Deep graph normalizer (DGN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> presents the first graph neural network (GNN) for multigraph fusion. It addresses both cross-view and cross-individual variability and complexity of a given population. Specifically, each layer of GNN integrates views and learns deeper embeddings for each node, generating the most well-centered CBT based on a random subject normalized loss (SNL). DGN presents the state-of-the-art method in multi-view data integration according to a recent comparative survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. MGN-Net <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> further improves DGN by introducing a new loss function, which preserves the topology of the learned CBT.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although effective, such methods were not originally designed to learn a CBT from graph data distributed at different centers. To overcome this limitation, the effort has been recently dedicated to developing multi-center CBT learning using powerful FL algorithms, which utilize knowledge from several remote centers without accessing the data kept in these centers.
A pioneering approach is Fed-CBT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which is an FL framework based on a multi-view graph connectivity mapping approach that attempts to build a globally representative cross-hospital CBT in a completely data-preserving way. However, TW-FedCBT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> is designed to improve the FL aggregation by a temporally weighted strategy, failing to handle the severe heterogeneous case where the data across hospitals is non-IIDs as it is limited to learning from hospitals with similar domain distributions.
Precisely, the template generated by Fed-CBT may not fully capture the inter-individual brain connection variability in a federated setting.</p>

There are several advantages for FL in medical imaging applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. First, FL enables the collaborative training of machine learning models across different institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This is particularly important for medical imaging, where the privacy and security of patient data are of utmost importance. Second, it allows for the efficient use of distributed resources, enabling the training of large-scale machine-learning models on distributed data. This can improve the accuracy and robustness of machine-learning models for medical imaging applications. Third, FL eliminates the need for large-scale data transfers, which can save bandwidth and reduce latency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to these advantages, FL has been widely applied in medical imaging, such as disease detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, medical image segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, medical Image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and brain network analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Interested readers can refer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> for a comprehensive review of FL in medical imaging.
However, FL also poses several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the quality, privacy, and security of the machine learning models.
In particular, FL faces a significant challenge in non-IDD scenarios, where the FL performance degrades. Multi-domain learning (MDL) within the context of FL is an emerging research area that aims to address the challenges of FL in scenarios with heterogeneous and non-IID data distribution across different domains.
Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed to keep batch normalization layers locally during model aggregation.
Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> offered a new solution to address performance degradation in cross-domain FL by loading only a subset of the global model’s parameters.
Wicaksana et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> introduced a customized FL, where clients iteratively train individual models based on global feature extraction layers.
This method outperforms methods that use the federated model for feature alignment and guide private model training, enabling clients to enhance personalized models.</p>

Using FreeSurfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) cortical surfaces are generated from T1-weighted MR images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Subsequently, using the morphology of the cortical surface, we construct 6 morphological brain networks using the Desikan-Killiany Atlas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, including 35 regions of interest (ROIs).
To measure the correlation between two regions, we compute the absolute difference of the average cortical attribute values in these two regions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
The morphological brain networks quantify the shape relationship between different cortical regions for a specific cortical attribute.
For each subject, we have a connectivity tensor constructed from 6 cortical morphological brain networks regarding different surface attributes, including cortical surface area, minimum principle area, maximum principal curvature, average curvature, mean cortical thickness, and mean sulcal depth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.</p>

First, it should be well-centered, meaning that it satisfies the minimum distance requirement for all subjects in the population.
Second, it should be discriminative, capturing the unique population connectivities.
Last, it should be topologically sound, preserving globally the topological properties of the individual complex brain networks after being mapped into a population-driven template.</p>

By averaging the mean Frobenius distance from the estimated CBT to all views of a connectivity tensor of each subject from the testing set, we assess the centeredness of the estimated CBTs given by different comparison methods and ablated versions across all folds of each hospital for all four datasets, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.2 Implementation Details ‣ 4 Experiments &amp; Discussion ‣ Metadata-Driven Federated Learning of Connectional Brain Templates in Non-IID Multi-Domain Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
The results indicate that our <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> provides the best performance with the minimum Frobenius distance across all datasets and hospitals.
This demonstrates that our <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> is an effective federated CBT learning model and significantly (p&lt;0.001) outperforms the SOTA comparison models in terms of centeredness across all folds and evaluation datasets.
Furthermore, the full version of <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.3.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> also outperforms its ablated versions (i.e., RandDGN, MetaDGN, and RandFed), indicating that metadata-driven connectivity generation and FL are effective in improving the CBT learning from non-IID multi-site connectivities.
Especially, the supervised versions (i.e., MetaDGN and <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.3.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span>) show an obvious improvement against the unsupervised versions (i.e., RandDGN and RandFedCBT).
It shows that our metadata regressor effectively conducts the generation and can capture valid statistical information from other hospitals’ data. With the local model updating of FL based on MetaDGN, <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.3.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> slightly outperforms the simpler version in many folds and datasets, which can be explained by the fact that our method needs a round-by-round model weights communication to correct the bias of predicted metadata by the regressor in some cases.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">We conduct an assessment of the topological validity of the learned CBTs at the node-wise scale. We use the different topological measures to capture graph topological properties of brain connectivity, including PageRank <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> and effective node size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
For each measure, a discrete probability distribution can be derived by calculating the topological measures for each node and then normalizing them with respect to the total sum of measures across all nodes. In order to have a comprehensive topological analysis, we first average the distribution of topological measures of multi-view connectivity graphs of each testing subject as ground truth. We then use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure to compare the estimated CBT constructed from the training dataset with this ground truth.
Especially, the KL divergence of the ground truth distributions <math id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A representative CBT can capture the unique characteristics of brain networks of a given population, making it easily distinguishable from the CBT of another population.
These distinctive features can be utilized in clinical applications for biological classification tasks, such as distinguishing informative biomarkers to facilitate disease diagnosis.
To demonstrate the discriminative ability of our federated CBT, we perform an additional evaluation, which trains an SVM classifier using one-shot learning, with two CBTs, one for the ASD population and the other for the NC population, as input.
The trained SVM is employed to test with the input of the ASD and NC subject-specific CBTs from the global testing set.
We set up two classification tasks, namely ASD-LH vs. NC-LH and ASD-RH vs. NC-RH.
Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Implementation Details ‣ 4 Experiments &amp; Discussion ‣ Metadata-Driven Federated Learning of Connectional Brain Templates in Non-IID Multi-Domain Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> reports the comparison of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores between different methods.
The results indicate that CBTs learned by our <span id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> are most discriminative compared with SOTA methods, where they yield the highest classification performance.
This further confirms our observations in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.2 Implementation Details ‣ 4 Experiments &amp; Discussion ‣ Metadata-Driven Federated Learning of Connectional Brain Templates in Non-IID Multi-Domain Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Implementation Details ‣ 4 Experiments &amp; Discussion ‣ Metadata-Driven Federated Learning of Connectional Brain Templates in Non-IID Multi-Domain Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Implementation Details ‣ 4 Experiments &amp; Discussion ‣ Metadata-Driven Federated Learning of Connectional Brain Templates in Non-IID Multi-Domain Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, and <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Implementation Details ‣ 4 Experiments &amp; Discussion ‣ Metadata-Driven Federated Learning of Connectional Brain Templates in Non-IID Multi-Domain Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

This suggests two conclusions.
First, generated multi-domain data can improve the performance of both conventional CBT learning and federated CBT learning.
Second, metadata can further improve performance with effective supervised learning, which boosts the quality of the generated multidomain data.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span>, the first FL framework for CBT learning from disparate brain connectivity domains.
Our <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> overcomes the limitations of existing methods that are unable to handle statistical data heterogeneity, (i.e., data/feature shift due to disparate hospital-specific connectivity patterns and distributions).
It is able to predict metadata that approximates other local domains in a fully supervised manner and leverages the metadata to generate effective connectivity data for boosting model’s robustness to non-IID data and CBT representativeness.
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">MetaFedCBT</span> in privacy-preserving CBT learning using connectivity datasets.</p>
