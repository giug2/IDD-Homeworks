<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework in which a set of local communities collaboratively learn a shared global model while retaining all training data locally within each community.
Two notions of fairness have recently emerged as important issues for federated learning: group fairness and community fairness. Group fairness requires that a model’s decisions do not favor any particular group based on a set of legally protected attributes such as race or gender. Community fairness requires that global models exhibit similar levels of performance (accuracy) across all collaborating communities. Both fairness concepts can coexist within an FL framework, but the existing literature has focused on either one concept or the other. This paper proposes and analyzes a post-processing <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fair federated learning</em> (FFL) framework called
<em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">post-FFL</em>. Post-FFL uses a linear program to simultaneously enforce group and community fairness while maximizing the utility of the global model. Because Post-FFL is a post-processing approach, it can be used with existing FL training pipelines whose convergence properties are well understood. This paper uses post-FFL on real-world datasets to mimic how hospital networks, for example, use federated learning to deliver community health care. Theoretical results bound the accuracy lost when post-FFL enforces both notion of fairness. Experimental results illustrate that post-FFL simultaneously improves both group and community fairness in FL. Moreover, post-FFL outperforms the existing in-processing fair federated learning in terms of improving both notions of fairness, communication efficiency and computation cost.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is a distributed machine learning framework that uses data collected
from a group of community <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clients</em> to learn a global model that can be used by all clients in the group. The communities served by these clients are formed from sets of remote users (e.g. mobile phones) or organizations (e.g. medical clinics and hospitals) that all share some defining attribute such as a similar geographical location. FL algorithms such as <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> train the global model in a distributed manner by first having each community client use its local data to train a local model. This local model is then sent to the cloud server who averages these models and sends the averaged model back to the community clients who then retrain that model with their local data. This interaction between the clients and server continues for a several update cycles until it converges on a global model that is agreeable to all clients. While there were no theoretical convergence guarantees with the original FL algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, subsequent analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Smith et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> did provide
theoretical convergence analysis for this FL training pipeline. Since then
FL has come to be a dominant framework for distributed machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, particularly in smart city <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jiang et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Zheng et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Qolomany et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Pandya et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> and smart healthcare applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rieke et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Nguyen et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Antunes et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Brisimi et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> .</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper considers two related notions of fairness relevant to federated learning: Group Fairness and Community Fairness.
Group fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dwork et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Hardt et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Zafar et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is concerned with achieving similar outcomes for groups defined by legally protected (a.k.a. sensitive) attributes such as race or gender. For community fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Gross, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>, a community may consist of individuals living in the same geographic location. Community fairness, therefore, is more concerned with ensuring that these geographically distinct communities have equal access to resources. Group fairness, on the other hand, requires that all individuals with the same legally protected attribute receive the same benefits as those outside of the protected group regardless of their membership in these geographically distinct communities or neighborhoods.
Both fairness concepts (group vs. community) are relevant to federated learning. This is particularly true in smart healthcare applications where a physician’s decisions should not be influenced by factors such as age, race, or gender <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Parsa-Parsi, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and yet city leaders want to ensure that all geographically distinct neighborhoods perceive they have the same accessibility to adequate health care. Whether one can balance these two fairness concepts in an FL platform and what might be the cost of attaining such balance is the main topic of this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This paper defines group fairness with respect to Equal Opportunity (EO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hardt et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> and community fairness with respect to Fair Resource Allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. EO ensures that those who deserve services receive them in a manner that is independent of any sensitive attributes. Fair Resource Allocation requires the likelihood of accurate outcomes to be uniform across all participating communities.
We apply EO to group fairness because most legal standards, such as those from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Peck, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">1975</a>)</cite>, mandate that the true positive rate be consistent across sensitive attributes. However, EO may not be appropriate for communities that receive resources (services or infrastructure) from the city. EO focuses exclusively on individuals who deserve to benefit from resources (true positives), without preventing unqualified individuals from receiving resources. It could lead to surplus resource allocation in some communities.
One example of this scenario might be seen in health care delivery, where a hospital network sees that the number of clinics per capita is equal between rural and urban residents. However, rural residents may still perceive inequality because the effort required to access these clinics (distance traveled) is much greater than that of the urban dwellers.
Fair Resource Allocation considers both true positives and true negatives across all communities. This paper examines whether it is possible to achieve Equal Opportunity and Fair Resources Allocation in federated learning and seeks to estimate the cost we incur in achieving both fairness objectives.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several recent papers have proposed methods for achieving either group or community fairness in federated learning. The methods fall into three categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Pre-processing techniques achieve model fairness by modifying the data set used to train the model. This may be done by weighting the training samples as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abay et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Pre-processing techniques, however, cannot simultaneously address group and community fairness. In-processing techniques typically modify the federated learning framework’s optimization algorithms. Current approaches either employ dynamic aggregation weights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yue et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Ezzeldin et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>; Chu et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Rodríguez-Gálvez et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Lyu et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> or use adversarial training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Du et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Mohri et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. These approaches, however, complicate the existing FL training pipeline and lack formal convergence guarantees. Our paper is the first to apply post-processing in FL. Post-processing uses models selected by an existing training pipeline to generate a randomized model that achieves fairness.
Prior post-processing work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hardt et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Fish et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Menon &amp; Williamson, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Pleiss et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Chzhen et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Denis et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhao &amp; Gordon, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Zeng et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Xian et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> does not consider federated learning (FL), nor does it simultaneously address community and group fairness, which is the subject of this paper.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section provides a statistical interpretation of group and community fairness that allows us to address fairness issues in the federated learning of models that predict outcomes for individuals in a group of communities. The community group is a collection of geographically distinct human communities. Each community is a <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">client</em> that uses the local data it has on its inhabitants to select a local model that predicts health outcomes for a given inhabitant. All community clients send their local models to a global <em id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">server</em> who then aggregates the models into a global model. The resulting global model, however, may not be fair either with respect to group or community notions defined below. The main problem is to find a way to <em id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">transform</em> the global model into a <em id="S2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fair global model</em>.

To obtain conditions for the existence of a fair outcome predictor, we will first show that equation (<a href="#S3.E8" title="Equation 8 ‣ Proposition 3.1. ‣ 3 Achieving Group and Community Fairness ‣ Post-Fair Federated Learning: Achieving Group and Community Fairness in Federated Learning via Post-processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>) can be recast as a linear program.
The existence of a fair outcome predictor is then equivalent to that linear program having non-negative solutions.</p>

Note that because
post-FFL simply post-processes the models obtained by <span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>, the communication and computation cost of post-FFL is accurately represented by <span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>’s cost. So the results
in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Communication Efficiency and Computational Cost ‣ 5.2 Comparison with other algorithms ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Post-Fair Federated Learning: Achieving Group and Community Fairness in Federated Learning via Post-processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> are actually comparing post-FFL’s computational cost to the inprocessing fair FL algorithms <span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairFed</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">q-FedAvg</span>. The computation time results were obtained on a 16-Core 4.00 GHz AMD RYZEN Threadripper Pro 5955WX Processor. The average time is calculated over 30 communication rounds for each method.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The results in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Communication Efficiency and Computational Cost ‣ 5.2 Comparison with other algorithms ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Post-Fair Federated Learning: Achieving Group and Community Fairness in Federated Learning via Post-processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> show that the number of communication rounds required by post-FFL is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than that required by <span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">q-FedAvg</span> and one order of magnitude lower than what <span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairFed</span> required.
The post-FFL’s computation time for a single round was comparable to that used by <span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">q-FedAvg</span>. When compared to
<span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairFed</span>, post-FFL single round time was comparable on the more complex HM10000 dataset and an order of magnitude faster on the Adult dataset. The table shows for the total amount of time needed for algorithm convergence, post-FFL was 2 order of magnitude faster on the Adult data set and about one order faster on the HM10000 dataset for both in-processing fair FL algorithms.
Training curves for a specific run in Fig.<a href="#A4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ D.2 Baselines ‣ Appendix D Additional Experimental Details and Results ‣ Post-Fair Federated Learning: Achieving Group and Community Fairness in Federated Learning via Post-processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> of Appendix <a href="#A4.SS2" title="D.2 Baselines ‣ Appendix D Additional Experimental Details and Results ‣ Post-Fair Federated Learning: Achieving Group and Community Fairness in Federated Learning via Post-processing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">D.2</span></a> provide a more ”graphic” illustration of post-FFL’s convergence speed.
These results, therefore, support our assertion that post-FFL (FedAvg) has significantly lower computational and communication cost than prior in-processing approaches to fair FL.</p>

We observe resents these results which show that post-FFL reduced EOD

community fairness across different heterogeneity scenarios. Compared to Scenario 1, Scenario 2 has a higher degree of data heterogeneity, resulting in a greater initial AD for <span id="S5.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>. Consequently, the accuracy traded for fairness in Scenario 2 (0.110) is greater than in Scenario 1 (0.108). This demonstrates that as the level of data heterogeneity increases, the accuracy traded to ensure fairness also increases.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose the post-FFL framework, which simultaneously achieves group and community fairness in FL. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that post-FFL allows users to adjust the degree of fairness, and the theoretical results associated with it can predict the accuracy cost for fairness. Post-FFL outperforms existing baselines in fair federated learning in terms of fairness improvement, communication efficiency, and computational cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Post-FFL selects a random outcome predictor from a fixed set of classifiers. The fixed nature of this set may limit the achievable accuracy. Existing literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hardt et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Xian et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> derives fair predictor from a pre-trained score function may lead to a more optimal model. We will explore the score-based approach in FL in future work.</p>
