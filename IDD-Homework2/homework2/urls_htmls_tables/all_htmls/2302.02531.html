<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Data scarcity and heterogeneity pose significant performance challenges for personalized federated learning, and these challenges are mainly reflected in overfitting and low precision in existing methods.
To overcome these challenges, a multi-layer multi-fusion strategy framework is proposed in this paper, i.e., the server adopts the network layer parameters of each client upload model as the basic unit of fusion for information-sharing calculation.
Then, a new fusion strategy combining personalized and generic is purposefully proposed, and the network layer number fusion threshold of each fusion strategy is designed according to the network layer function.
Under this mechanism, the <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="L_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">L</mi><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐿</ci><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">L_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>-Norm negative exponential similarity metric is employed to calculate the fusion weights of the corresponding feature extraction layer parameters for each client, thus improving the efficiency of heterogeneous data personalized collaboration.
Meanwhile, the federated global optimal model approximation fusion strategy is adopted in the network full-connect layer, and this generic fusion strategy alleviates the overfitting introduced by forceful personalized.
Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing emphasis on data privacy, federated learning without sharing private data has attracted more scholarly attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Because of the non-shared data feature that protects user privacy, federated learning is commonly utilized in the financial, medical, industrial, and energy domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
While there has been a significant amount of work focusing on the optimization aspects of federated learning, model overfitting and data heterogeneity remain key challenges to be faced in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
The heterogeneous data with non-independent and identically distributed makes the model obtained by each client one-sided, which cannot represent the integrity of the sample space.
In this context, the argument that data heterogeneity exacerbates the overfitting of the model is held in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, how to design reliable algorithms for the client-side data heterogeneity problem is the essence of studying federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address this problem, a global model re-parameterization idea was suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which uses the fusion model as a constraint target for the client, causing the client model to be trained to approximate that target.
However, this method does not consider the collaboration type, resulting in similar clients not effectively using model information of each other for performance improvement.
In this case, some personalized federated learning (PFL) methods have been proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which are dedicated to optimising the collaboration strategy between client models.
Specifically, a similar strategy to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, with the improved aspect of changing the global model as the penalty target to a private model for each client.
Further, the pFedMe proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> uses the Moreau envelopes as a constraint term to enable personalized deployment of the client model, where a bi-level strategy was adopted to calculate the server model of conditional convergence.
Based on the strategy of adding additional terms, the improved PFL method compensates for the weakness of personalized data processing in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which was caused by pursuing the global optimum through the weighted average client model.
Unfortunately, the lack of processing strategies for data heterogeneity in server fusion has led to a general problem of low precision in these methods.
Accordingly, it is necessary to design a fine-grained fusion policy to calculate the personalized weights of each client.
Under this case, a method named personalized federated few-shot learning was developed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and the core idea of this method is to construct a client personalization feature space, where the feature similarity is calculated as a metric to determine the fusion weight of each client.
Furthermore, the fusion model is utilized as the penalty term of the corresponding client to improve the personalization capability.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, a novel client-personalized weight calculation strategy is developed on the server side, i.e., the weighting factors are designed as negative exponential mapping distances between each other’s models.
Then, the personalized model of each client is obtained by the weighting calculation, which will be used as a penalty factor for the optimization objective to improve the model performance.
Similarly, a weighting strategy with a different structure is also proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which uses the first-order extreme value points of the model loss function to approximate the optimal weights.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the sophisticated personalized fusion rules set in these PFL methods lead to the risk of overfitting while solving the data heterogeneity problem.
To mitigate the overfitting phenomenon in federated learning, a method of Gaussian processes-based PFL was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, which has a better representation of the model due to the nature of Bayesian.
Analogously, a PFL method based on Bayesian neural networks was proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, where the penalty term is denoted as the KL distance between the hypothetical distribution and the posterior distribution of the model parameters.
Notice that both the kernel function selection in the Gaussian process and the parameter hypothetical distribution in the Bayesian neural network depends on a large amount of data support, which makes these two methods unsuitable for scenarios with a small amount of heterogeneous data.
Therefore, the overfitting problem of heterogeneous data with few samples is still a problem that each client needs to focus on.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To meet the data heterogeneity requirements of different clients, global efficiency and local model personality issues are considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
This inspires us to design the global model as a generic term to solve the overfitting problem and the personalized model as a penalty term to meet the personalized needs of heterogeneous data, respectively.
Meanwhile, an idea of fusion based on the neural network layers was suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
And then, a layer-based federated learning method was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, which requires a portion of the raw data for the server to train the fused weights.
Although this method defeats the original purpose of federated learning data preservation, it further reminds us to integrate the generic and personality terms into one model, where the network layer is treated as the most basic fusion unit.
Moreover, a deep neural network is considered by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> to be divided into two parts, shallow and deep, and it is noted that they are generic and specialized, respectively, further inspiring the design of a functional layer-based fusion strategy in this paper.</p>

Moreover, when designing the fusion rule in this paper, each client’s layer parameter is proposed to be viewed as the basic unit.
This also inspires us to focus on the influence of using different fusion strategies at the same layer.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, a layer-based client collaboration idea is improved to enhance refinement processing capability, based on which a personalized fusion framework with multi-layer multi-fusion strategies is designed.
Then, a threshold calculation rule involving the number of network layers under each fusion strategy is designed.
Furthermore, a cross-fusion rule will be developed to tackle the problem of data heterogeneity and overfitting in the PFL background.
For more visualization, the overall framework of the proposed pFedCFR is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III Proposed method ‣ Cross-Fusion Rule for Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.9" class="ltx_p">Conventional methods achieve collaboration between clients by weighted fusion of overall models, but these methods ignore the specificity of network layer functionality and its varying roles under different models.
To solve this problem, a layer-based fusion structure is developed in this paper, using neural network layers as the basis fusion unit.

Noting that the message passing mechanism in (<a href="#S3.E10" title="In III-C1 Personalized Fusion Rule ‣ III-C Cross-Fusion Rule ‣ III Proposed method ‣ Cross-Fusion Rule for Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>) enhances the influence between similar feature layers, the designed personalized fusion rule is based on the original data feature extraction layer, which can effectively solve the model collaboration problem of similar datasets in data heterogeneity.
Meanwhile, the generic fusion rule designed in (<a href="#S3.E12" title="In III-C2 Generic Fusion Rule ‣ III-C Cross-Fusion Rule ‣ III Proposed method ‣ Cross-Fusion Rule for Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>) argues that the contributions of all models are equivalent.
The idea is then applied to the fully connected layer, which means that the overfitting caused by the exclusion of non-similarity layers in personalized fusion rules can be mitigated.</p>

Specifically, by using the heterogeneous data construction rules in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, we first assign corresponding labels to each client, then divide the number of samples using the strategy of combining lognormal distribution and random factor, and finally achieve the segmentation of all client samples.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed pFedCFR is experimentally validated on several heterogeneous datasets, where the performance comparison results with various typical approaches are expressed in TABLE <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-B Results on Heterogeneity Data ‣ IV Experimental Result ‣ Cross-Fusion Rule for Personalized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, and these results confirm that the proposed method is effective.
As can be seen from the table, pFedCFR outperforms the other fusion models in terms of prediction accuracy, especially in the CIFAR-10 (CNN) configuration setting, with an accuracy of 0.7809, which improves the accuracy value by 0.015 over the second-ranked FedAMP.
At the same time, it is noticed that FedAvg and FedProx with global optimization ideas in the experimental results are far inferior to pFedMe and FedAMP with personalized fusion strategy in terms of accuracy, which indicates that the PFL fusion strategy studied in this paper is urgent under the non-independent and identical distribution of heterogeneity data.</p>

In particular, the FedAMP consistently presents a decrease in loss without an increase in test accuracy after about 40 rounds.
This implied that while the message-passing strategy enhances feature collaboration between similar clients, it reduces model generality, which leads to overfitting.
Combining the test accuracy and loss comparison of the three benchmark experiments shows that the performance of Ditto needs to be improved, although no overfitting effect was observed.
Interestingly, it is shown from the experiments that the proposed pFedCFR has significant performance improvement and alleviates the overfitting phenomenon mentioned above.
Moreover, the test accuracy and stability of pFedCFR outperformed the pFedMe in all experiments.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a new PFL method called pFedCFR has been developed for the data heterogeneity problem among multiple clients.
The designed multi-layer multi-fusion strategies framework based on layer functions effectively improves the low-performance problem caused by single fusion policy in existing federated learning.
Then, a fusion strategy combining personalization and generalization is designed to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon caused by forceful personalized mechanisms.
The extended experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, consider the following critical issues in the PFL algorithm:
i). although the overfitting phenomenon is alleviated, it still exists in the forceful personalized fusion rules,
ii). only two functions, the feature extraction layer and the decision layer, are considered.
Therefore, we will work on a more detailed and generic fusion strategy based on pFedCFR.</p>
