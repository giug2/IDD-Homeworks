<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) has been gaining a lot of traction in the machine learning community in the recent years due to the challenges posed in understanding information coming from multiple modalities (i.e., images, language). In VQA, a series of questions are posed based on a set of images and the task at hand is to arrive at the answer. To achieve this, we take a symbolic reasoning based approach using the framework of formal logic. The image and the questions are converted into symbolic representations on which explicit reasoning is performed. We propose a formal logic framework where (i) images are converted to logical background facts with the help of scene graphs, (ii) the questions are translated to first-order predicate logic clauses using a transformer based deep learning model, and (iii) perform satisfiability checks, by using the background knowledge and the grounding of predicate clauses, to obtain the answer. Our proposed method is highly interpretable and each step in the pipeline can be easily analyzed by a human. We validate our approach on the CLEVR and the GQA dataset. We achieve near perfect accuracy of 99.6% on the CLEVR dataset comparable to the state of art models, showcasing that formal logic is a viable tool to tackle visual question answering. Our model is also data efficient, achieving 99.1% accuracy on CLEVR dataset when trained on just 10% of the training data.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the recent years AI research has been moving towards
solving increasingly difficult problems with the goal of building a general purpose intelligence system. To achieve this, these AI systems require an understanding of information
acquired through multiple modalities (visual, audio, language
etc.,) in order to make decisions related to various tasks. Visual
question answering (VQA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is one such task that integrates
the domains of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language
Processing (NLP).</p>

The last two examples are taken from the GQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> dataset containing images taken from natural settings.</figcaption>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In VQA, a series of questions is posed based on a scene (image) (Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction. ‣ Visual Question Answering based on Formal Logic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) and the objective is to answer these questions based on the information provided. In the most general case, images can contain a lot of objects making it hard to parse the scene. In some cases the necessary information may not be readily available from the images and may depend some commonsense facts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Additionally, questions posed could be of arbitrary complexity due to convoluted chains of logical reasoning. Moreover, models which directly learn input to output mappings are found to have greater sensitivity towards dataset biases, and fail to learn any underlying reasoning mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. These challenges make VQA a difficult problem to solve.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, there have been several attempts to convert images into a structured format, to aid the process of reasoning. Notably, scene graphs (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction. ‣ Visual Question Answering based on Formal Logic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) provide a structured representation of the objects in the scene along with the associated relations in the form of a graph. Here, the vertices of the graph correspond to the objects and the edges depict the relations between the objects. Significant contributions have been made towards converting images to scene graphs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Since a scene graph is a symbolic representation of a scene, this opens up the possibility of performing symbolic reasoning on images. Building on this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> show how scene graphs can be utilized for image captioning and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> demonstrate the use of scene graphs in their VQA pipeline. In particular, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> make use of Graph Neural Networks on top of the scene graph to create higher level abstractions, making it not very easily trainable. In this paper we directly operate on the scene graph instead of dealing with the images, but do so in the context of formal logic. The scene graphs are converted into a set of background facts about the scene which are easy to interpret and the translation requires very little effort.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the works on scene graphs, several attempts have been made to model natural language questions as compositions of simple programs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> showcased the use of this approach for VQA by converting the questions into compositions of operations and using neural executors to run them. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> modified <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>’s approach by introducing curriculum learning training objective and showed significant improvement. By the same token <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> modified this further by adding structural scene representation to scene and managed to obtain really good results on the CLEVR dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. These methods validate the symbolic reasoning approach to parsing questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">With regards to symbolic reasoning, formal logic has traditionally been used in AI as it provides a platform for constructing rules and performing inference on symbolic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Due to this, formal logic is highly interpretable, but not very effective when it comes to working with noisy data such as images. To circumvent this issue, neural networks are introduced to convert noisy data to a structured format, enabling the use of formal logic to develop solutions that are both robust and interpretable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we attempt to solve the Visual Question Answering (VQA) problem utilizing the framework of formal logic. Inspired by the advances in scene graph generation and question to program synthesis, we propose a novel VQA pipeline consisting of: (i) conversion of scene graphs into formal logic facts, (ii) transformer-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> semantic parser for translating questions into formal logic clauses and (iii) a logic inference engine performing satisfiability check on the clauses to produce answers. To elaborate, the logic clauses act as query statements on the background facts. The resulting facts and rules are highly interpretable as they are encoded as human readable formal logic statements, making it easy to analyze the reasoning process. Finally, given the rules and the facts, we utilize prolog <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to perform satifiability check. Importantly, the scene graph and questions are processed separately until the final stage of the pipeline, after which they are combined to obtain the answers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed solution has the following advantanges: (i) The question to rule conversion is highly parallelized due to the use of transformers, thereby making the training of question to rule translation highly efficient on GPUs, (ii) the use of formal logic to represent images and questions makes our intermediate stages interpretable to a great extent, and can easily be analyzed by a human at every stage, (iii) it is highly data efficient with minimal change in performance when trained with fraction of the available data, refer to Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A CLEVR Dataset ‣ III Experiments ‣ Visual Question Answering based on Formal Logic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>.

The rule generation can now be viewed as a machine translation problem going from english sentences to the the target sentence. To that end, we implement a transformer based sequence to sequence model to translate the question to the target sentence. We use a BART <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> pretrained on sequence regeneration task and add a MLP + softmax layer at the end.

In case the target rule produced after translation has syntax errors, then the inference engine outputs a NULL.</p>

From knowing the definition of the predicates (defined in Section <a href="#S2.SS2.SSS2" title="II-B2 Representation of Question in the form of first order logic rule ‣ II-B VQA Pipeline. ‣ II Methodology ‣ Visual Question Answering based on Formal Logic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span>2</span></a>), the target rule can easily be interpreted by a human. For example, considering the first example in Figure <a href="#S2.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ II-B2 Representation of Question in the form of first order logic rule ‣ II-B VQA Pipeline. ‣ II Methodology ‣ Visual Question Answering based on Formal Logic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> we need to check if there are any other things with the same size as the brown shiny sphere. Looking at the corresponding target clause we see that it is a conjunction of four predicates where the first three predicates filter out objects with the attributes <span id="S3.SS1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">brown, metal, sphere</span> and the last predicate checks if there are two objects with the same set of attributes mentioned earlier. Therefore looking at the translated rules we know exactly what is happening underneath and what the satisfiability check is looking for.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To train the translation model, we make use of the functional form provided by the dataset for each question to produce the target sentence. Similar to CLEVR, every operation in the functional form is mapped to a predicate/rule in the target sentence. We found the functional forms provided by the dataset to be inconsistent in the semantics used for defining the arguments associated with the operations in the functional form, refer to the supplementary materials for more details. This resulted in incorrect target sentences for certain questions, therefore we restrict our training to only those questions having consistent functional forms.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the GQA validation set, we obtained an overall accuracy of (74%) but this contains several questions corresponding to inconsistent functional forms for which the model wasn’t trained for. When the validation set is limited to those questions which have a consistent functional form, then the validation accuracy becomes (93%), which is a better indicator of the model’s performance on the GQA datasets. This is comparable to the current state of the art for the GQA dataset under perfect site configuration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> (96.3%). Aside from the fact that the proposed solution is also highly interpretable and the reasoning steps are easy to follow, the training of the transformer is much more easier to perform than a Graph Neural Network used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we showcased the feasibility of using an interpretable formal logic based approach to solve the visual question answering problem. We circumvent the inflexibility of formal logic systems to noisy inputs by using transformers to translate natural language questions to interpretable logic rules. From the conducted experiments, it can be seen that our proposed solution is competitive and even manages to achieve near perfect accuracy on the CLEVR dataset. It is also data efficient and there is only a slight drop in accuracy even when trained with just 10% data from the CLEVR dataset.</p>
