<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The report demonstrates the benefits (in terms of improved claims loss modeling) of harnessing the value of Federated Learning (FL) to learn a single model across multiple insurance industry datasets without requiring the datasets themselves to be shared from one company to another. The application of FL addresses two of the most pressing concerns: limited data volume and data variety, which are caused by privacy concerns, the rarity of claim events, the lack of informative rating factors, etc.. During each round of FL, collaborators compute improvements on the model using their local private data, and these insights are combined to update a global model. Such aggregation of insights allows for an increase to the effectiveness in forecasting claims losses compared to models individually trained at each collaborator. Critically, this approach enables machine learning collaboration without the need for raw data to leave the compute infrastructure of each respective data owner. Additionally, the open-source framework, OpenFL, that is used in our experiments is designed so that it can be run using confidential computing as well as with additional algorithmic protections against leakage of information via the shared model updates. In such a way, FL is implemented as a privacy-enhancing collaborative learning technique that addresses the challenges posed by the sensitivity and privacy of data in traditional machine learning solutions. This paper’s application of FL can also be expanded to other areas including fraud detection, catastrophe modeling, etc., that have a similar need to incorporate data privacy into machine learning collaborations. Our framework and empirical results provide a foundation for future collaborations among insurers, regulators, academic researchers, and InsurTech experts.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The exponential growth of data offers substantial potential for cross-industry data sharing, gaining industry-level insights and developing standards, enhancing organizational efficiency, as well as fostering technological innovation. As an industry heavily dependent on policyholders’ and external risk-related data, insurance can also leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements to fuel next-generation innovations. Prior research indicates that machine learning (ML) models can considerably improve underwriting, claim loss modeling, reserving, and fraud detection. (c.f. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Baudry and Robert,, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Blier-Wong et al.,, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Hanafy and Ming,, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a></cite>). However, the insurance industry is grappling with the withholding of proprietary data, which hinders the free flow of data and collaborations between companies. Conversely, traditional ML tasks benefit from a centralized computing center or server to collect all data and the computing center is in charge of the entire life-cycle of ML tasks, ranging from data pre-processing to model deployment. However, the sensitivity and privacy of the personal data that each insurer holds make centralized data collection and model training impossible in real-life industrial applications. The lack of access to data across business divisions within a corporation and the boundaries of insurance firms make it challenging to develop comparative analysis and uncover business insights that can only be learned from data aggregation. Evidently, the lack of mature technology that enables open collaborations while safeguarding against the risks of giving away proprietary business information and client privacy data is a roadblock to next-generation innovations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The withholding of proprietary data is rooted in ongoing discussions about the use of ML that require further investigation, despite its widespread use in various industries including insurance. Potential risks regarding leakage of customer privacy and legislation related to the evolution of ML have captured the attention of academic researchers, industry practitioners, and regulatory institutions. Some of the most pressing issues are the ownership of ML models, fairness of ML algorithms, legislation supervision, and customer/company data privacy. The transmission of ML models and model training procedures challenge the conventional definition of copyright, where it is difficult to distinguish between data providers and model trainers as the owner of ML models. Regulatory institutions need to shift their focus from solely evaluating AI industry performance gains to creating a transparent, responsible, and explainable environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a framework of federated learning as a privacy-enhancing solution to enable potential collaborations among the insurance industry and take advantage of state-of-the-art ML collaboration. Federated Learning, first proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">McMahan et al., (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, is a distributed approach to train an ML model that avoids the limitations and risks of centralized data storage, which is a critical prerequisite for standard ML solutions. From a business operations perspective, as summarized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Li et al., (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, federated learning is a privacy-enhancing collaborative learning technique that addresses the challenges posed by the sensitivity and privacy of data in traditional ML solutions. As a result, federated learning enables ML innovations even when data centers or computing servers cannot collect datasets physically. With the rise of federated learning, researchers and practitioners have joined forces in various multidisciplinary federated learning projects to achieve goals that were once believed to be impossible. See <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Niknam et al., (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Rieke et al., (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Pati et al., (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Among all potential collaborations, our work focuses on the application of federated learning in insurance claim loss modeling, addressing two of the most pressing concerns: data volume and data variety.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We propose that federated learning would be the next evolution in the insurance industry, solving data challenges with unprecedented effectiveness and efficiency by sharing knowledge and expertise while enhancing privacy. For instance, through the partnerships between different insurance companies, and among insurance companies and InsurTech companies, each private “data owner” trains a model locally using only their own data, the parameters of which are then shared with the central “aggregation server” to create a consensus model with accumulated knowledge from all “data owners” to create a more complete picture of risk assessment of policyholders and industry-level of insights. Such multi-institutional collaboration without sharing data among the collaborators is of great value to insurance companies, industrial associations, governments, and regulators.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The insurance industry, which mitigates and manages societal risks, exerts a notable influence on society and the global economy. Insurance companies provide financial protection to individuals, businesses, and communities against various types of risks, such as death, injury, illness, property damage, and liability, by collecting premiums from policyholders and using the funds to pay out claims in the event of a direct or indirect financial loss. The insurance industry is characterized by its complex business structure, which encompasses various lines of business such as life, health, auto, property, liability, and commercial insurance. Furthermore, the life cycle of insurance products, including underwriting, pricing, claim reporting, claim processing, and fraud detection, adds to the complexity of the industry’s structure. The insurance industry has evolved over time and gradually adapted to the modernization of society, with the development of innovative insurance products, advanced risk management techniques, and sophisticated IT systems. In recent years, the industry has undergone significant changes due to technological advancements, changing customer demands, and regulatory changes, making the insurance industry a dynamic and challenging field that requires continuous innovation and adaptation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The insurance industry is highly regulated by country and, in some cases, by state or province, which aims to protect policyholders. Furthermore, insurance companies, as data owners, do not necessarily have all the competencies or budgets to develop various proof of concept (POC) projects that use AI technology. Legal constraints and technical barriers prevent data owners from further improving the ML models that can be trained on their limited data. To resolve these issues, we propose a research project to demonstrate that in a federated learning environment, a non-profit third-party university research group can provide strong techniques and act as a centralized hub to promote federation among insurance companies and InsurTech companies, and significantly improve the prediction performance of actuarial loss models. Meanwhile, data owners do not need to share their private data with other parties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The demonstration of the practicality of federated learning requires proprietary data from multiple insurance companies and InsurTech firms, which is often challenging for researchers. Gratefully, we have secured a collection of such proprietary data from multiple insurance industry partners to showcase the framework and methodology of federated learning in the insurance industry. Previously, we established a research framework for collaboration between universities and insurance industry partners. The collaboration enriched the existing dataset for research by providing proprietary information from the industry. This collaboration is unprecedented in finance and business in general.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on such a collaborative relationship, we propose applying ML, specifically supervised learning, to improve the partners’ in-house models in a hypothetical federated learning environment. As a result, we illustrate that real-life data created from the InsurTech innovation, which introduces data variety (additional information), can help significantly improve the underlying insurance company’s in-house models. In addition, uniting multiple insurance companies through federated learning will enhance every collaborates’ in-house models regarding the same line of business or the same business purpose. This innovation can be universally applied in the insurance industry in broader contexts.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>State of Claim Loss Modeling</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Claim loss modeling, referred by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Klugman et al., (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, is the term denoting the procedures of forecasting future claims reported by customers or policy costs through previous experience in the insurance industry, which is a critical indicator for insurance product pricing, underwriting, and thus crucial for insurance companies. In the case of pricing, the future claims predicted by the claim loss model represent the essential costs that companies are expected to prepare. These essential costs, denoted as <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">net premium</span>, implies an infimum of the premium that the insurance companies need to charge from customers. One of the common practices that insurance companies take to estimate the <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gross premium</span> (the estimated price insurance companies should charge from policyholders with the consideration of companies’ operation expenses, underwriting costs, commissions for insurance agents and other forms of costs and profit) is to evaluate the <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gross premium</span> through <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">net premium</span>. Thus, claim loss modeling is one of the most important components of the insurance business workflow. In addition to pricing, the claim loss models also serve as the analytic identifier of business trends to make informed decisions and satisfy regulations for reserve and solvency purposes. The more accurate the claim loss models insurance companies hold, the more precise the future claim losses can be predicted, which, from the perspective of policyholders, allows the improvement of pricing fairness and, from the viewpoint of insurance companies, reduces the operation risk and enhances the competitiveness in the market. Insurance companies, driven by the motivation to increase profits and improve risk management, are always interested in techniques that help the capability of claim loss models.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.4" class="ltx_p">In traditional insurance practice, the claim loss modeling can be deciphered by frequency and severity, which denotes the number of claims and cost of each claim, respectively.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.6" class="ltx_p">One of the traditional approaches to modeling this aggregated claim loss is using a standard mixture model which is compound Poisson-Gamma distribution, specifically Tweedie distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jørgensen and Paes De Souza,, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">1994</a>)</cite>, where the frequency of claims follows Poisson distribution and the severity of each claim can be described by Gamma distribution. However, with advances in AI, powerful ML models can be trained to forecast aggregated claim losses directly with improved prediction performance.

Data is particularly important in insurance because it is used for accurate risk assessment, pricing, managing risk, and identifying fraud, among others. Structured tabular datasets are organized by rows and columns. In the following, we refer to each row as one observation, which, in the reflection of insurance claim datasets, corresponds to the information of a policy/policyholder, and each of the columns denotes either a feature (risk factor) that insurance companies collected to describe the policy and identify potential risks, or a label indicating a target value (observed claim loss) the model is attempting to predict.

The foundation of insurance businesses is built upon the capability of accurately quantifying risks (potential car damages in auto insurance, costs of a lawsuit in liability insurance, mortality in life insurance, etc.) utilizing all collected information.

The claim events, usually referred to as “accidents”, are inherently infrequent, but have a significant impact on how risky policyholders can be differentiated from safe customers.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Lack of Data Volume</span>: In the claim loss experience of the insurance industry, the proportion of policyholders who submit at least one claim to insurance companies can be as low as 10%, and in a few business lines that cover only catastrophic crises or extreme events, the rate can be even lower than 0.1%. As a result of such rarity, the risk characteristics that help identify the risks can be under-represented by the occurred claim events or are not producing noticeable signals to be captured by claim loss models. Thus, without any collaboration, most insurance companies are always in a short supply of claim events to allow their claim loss models to better learn from the behaviors of risky policyholders. This is particularly true for insurers entering a new market without claim experience. Furthermore, one of the common techniques for solving a similar problem of imbalance is sampling, whose primary objective is to generate synthetically and statistically similar claim events or eliminate part of no-claim policyholders from the database to reshape the dataset into a balanced one. However, the sampling techniques are generally considered an unacceptable approach in the insurance domain as they distort the distribution of policyholders’ behaviors. Synthetic observations, though maybe statistically realistic, may not be a true representation of policyholders. Due to the limitation of sampling techniques in the insurance industry, a proper ML collaboration solution is needed to solve the issue.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the case of collaboration among multiple insurance companies, we assume that, due to the homogeneity of collaborators as insurance companies, their data share a common set of features, as well as a common label. The observations at all companies in this scenario could hypothetically be combined to form a global dataset in which the individual company datasets are horizontal partitions because these partitions are defined by subsets of rows (observations). A technical solution is desired that can simulate the act of training on the global dataset without actually requiring the companies to expose their data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As collaboration in this scenario increases the number of observations, we argue that this collaboration increases the data volume. Generally, the more companies participating in this collaboration, the larger the data volume, and correspondingly, it can provide a better characterization of risks from an industry-level perspective and avoid biases in the model that can lead to inaccurate predictions or recommendations. Such a collaboration is referred to as Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL).</p>

To accurately predict future claim losses, as many risk factors as possible should be considered. For instance, in addition to the risk factors traditionally used for modeling small business claim losses, including but not limited to business categorization, annual revenue, and employee size, more risk factors can be used through the evolution of new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Spender et al.,, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, telematics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Handel et al.,, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> and social media <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mosley Jr,, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> of the businesses in question. The true risk factors may lie in those additional features that traditional insurance companies do not consider in the modeling process. Furthermore, the cross-industry collaboration between insurance and related fields like banking and InsurTech data vendors can be beneficial, as the cross-section of small business policyholders among these industries creates an opportunity to characterize policyholders better than traditional underwriting procedures.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">For two companies where the scope of the collaboration is to improve the capability of insurance claim loss modeling, one is an insurance company that is in possession of a dataset with features and labels corresponding to observations on a set of policyholders, whereas the other one, an InsurTech company, holds a dataset of additional (new-technology-empowered) features collected on the same set of policyholders as those known by the insurance company. Note that the InsurTech company has no label information for this scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the common set of policyholders associated with the two company datasets, the features of the InsurTech company, and features and labels from the insurance company could hypothetically be combined to form a ‘global’ dataset of which the individual company datasets are ‘vertical’ partitions due to the fact that these partitions are defined by subsets of columns (features, label). Again, a technical solution that can simulate the act of training on this global dataset without actually requiring the companies to combine their data is desired. In this scenario, the collaboration between an insurance company and an InsureTech company increases data variety since the additional features result in improved claim loss modeling. Such a collaboration is referred to as Vertical Federated Learning (VFL).</p>

Insurance companies, which are central to the practice of risk forecasting and management, adopt a cautious and conservative approach in embracing ML collaboration due to the protection of customer privacy and the safeguarding of embedded confidential business strategies.

NN has proven to improve businesses and even offer possibilities for industry advancement. The backward propagation technique employed to update NN parameters can be conveniently adjusted to become compatible with the FL framework, while the design of ML architectures like Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines demands proper modification to fit into the FL framework.

The collaborators are in charge of, by order of each round of training, receiving the up-to-date aggregated model parameters, local model updates exploiting private data on their computing devices, and sending locally-updated model parameters in preparation for model aggregation. The central server differs drastically from the conventional one in that it does not hold any private information from collaborators or participate in any model updates in need of those confidential data. The central server in FL only takes the role of communication to receive local model parameters from all collaborators, perform certain aggregation procedures utilizing only the model parameters and send aggregated model parameters to each of the collaborators.

<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to the categorization of HFL, VFL, as demonstrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Privacy-Enhancing Collaborative Information Sharing through Federated Learning – A Case of the Insurance Industry" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, denotes the vertical partition where partial observations are shared among data collaborators related to the same observation subjects. Specifically, different from HFL, where all collaborators are in possession of labels, in the scheme of VFL, usually, only one collaborator holds labels of interest while other collaborators solely contribute features unique to its field. VFL applies to the case of homogeneity of observations but heterogeneity of features. In real-life applications, VFL satisfies the demand for multi-disciplinary collaborations.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the empirical study, although there are various insurance scenarios that can potentially benefit from the application of the FL framework, we specifically focus on the impact of privacy-enhancing collaborative learning on insurance claim loss modeling in both data volume and data variety aspects. As introduced in Subsection <a href="#S2.SS1" title="2.1 State of Claim Loss Modeling ‣ 2 Data Privacy-Enhancing in Insurance Industry ‣ Privacy-Enhancing Collaborative Information Sharing through Federated Learning – A Case of the Insurance Industry" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1</span></a>, claim loss modeling is a critical topic in all insurance business lines since it estimates future claim losses that will incur and be reported by policyholders and serves as a lower bound of the product price to guarantee the company’s solvency reserve and capability of profit. As such, it has become a popular topic among insurance academic research and industrial operation, ranging from traditional statistical distribution estimations summarized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Klugman et al., (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, to the applications of ML innovations suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Guelman, (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>.</p>

However, such a shortage of claim events, through a collaboration among insurance companies sharing the same concerns and selling similar insurance products, can be solved by the technique of HFL where a model can be trained across the union of the data collected by multiple companies.

As one of the solutions, VFL, allows for collaborative training using distinct feature sets (each held by a different collaborator) on a common set of observations. In our empirical experiments, there are specifically two collaborators that participate in the privacy-enhancing collaboration: an insurance company and an InsurTech company. InsurTech companies can provide alternative features to those the insurance companies have in their data, which can contain additional signals used to potentially improve predictions of the claim loss model. With VFL, collaborative training can proceed while privacy issues related to raw data exposure that would be present with direct data sharing can be mitigated.

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In accordance with the experimental design outlined in Subsection <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Impact of Data Volume ‣ 4 Empirical Experiments ‣ Privacy-Enhancing Collaborative Information Sharing through Federated Learning – A Case of the Insurance Industry" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a> and <a href="#S4.SS4" title="4.4 Impact of Data Variety ‣ 4 Empirical Experiments ‣ Privacy-Enhancing Collaborative Information Sharing through Federated Learning – A Case of the Insurance Industry" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4</span></a>, this subsection presents an analysis of the impact of privacy-enhancing machine learning collaboration on data volume and data variety. The results from experiments indicate that, while addressing data privacy concerns, the FL framework can potentially improve the accuracy of claim loss event prediction for insurance companies. The performance of the ML model, in our experiments, is evaluated by metrics of Percentage Error (PE). This metric embeds meaningful business intuition that measures the portfolio level accuracy.</p>

For collaborator B, by working with company A, it can be observed that PE is also improved in both the train set and the test set, from 0.22 to 0.13 and from 0.23 to 0.16, respectively. Thus, collaborator A and collaborator B, can both enhance their claim loss models through an increase in the data volume by privacy-enhancing HFL collaborations, compared to the locally trained models by collaborator A or collaborator B individually.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this report, we introduce FL model training to unlock the potential of siloed insurance data without exposing the raw data itself. To date, FL appears to be a largely unexplored technique for insurance industry ML collaborations. Although most insurance companies collect a substantial amount of data, privacy, ethical concerns, sovereignty, and the cost of moving data often result in the data being stored in silos where their use is limited. The use of this data for collaborative training across multiple entities, while protecting the raw data itself from exposure, would be a great benefit to the industry.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our results in Subsection <a href="#S4.SS5" title="4.5 Empirical Results ‣ 4 Empirical Experiments ‣ Privacy-Enhancing Collaborative Information Sharing through Federated Learning – A Case of the Insurance Industry" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.5</span></a> demonstrate the use of FL for improved claim loss modeling, by learning a claim loss model from data held at multiple insurance industry collaborators while mitigating exposure of each collaborator’s raw data to the others. Our empirical results show a benefit to insurance companies through the use of FL, with more accurate claim loss forecasting. Due to the rarity of claim events among policyholders and the lack of informative rating factors, insurance operations suffer from insufficient data to identify potential risks. Because accurate claim loss modeling can have a significant impact on aspects of businesses, such as underwriting, risk management, solvency, and regulatory compliance, finding solutions to this data shortage problem can be of critical importance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although we demonstrate the use of FL for improved loss modeling, there may be other applications of FL in the insurance industry. In addition to fraud detection, other use cases may exist, given the need for business intelligence that arises from the complex structure of the industry.</p>
