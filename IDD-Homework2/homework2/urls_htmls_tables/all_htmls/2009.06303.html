<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">We present a class of methods for robust, personalized federated learning, called Fed+, that unifies many federated learning algorithms. The principal advantage of this class of methods is to better accommodate the real-world characteristics found in federated training, such as the lack of IID data across parties, the need for robustness to outliers or stragglers, and the requirement to perform well on party-specific datasets. We achieve this through a problem formulation that allows the central server to employ robust ways of aggregating the local models while keeping the structure of local computation intact. Without making any statistical assumption on the degree of heterogeneity of local data across parties, we provide convergence guarantees for Fed+ for convex and non-convex loss functions under different (robust) aggregation methods. The Fed+ theory is also equipped to handle heterogeneous computing environments including stragglers without additional assumptions; specifically, the convergence results cover the general setting where the number of local update steps across parties can vary. We demonstrate the benefits of Fed+ through extensive experiments across standard benchmark datasets.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a technique for training machine learning models without sharing data, introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">McMahan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Konečnỳ <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, and steadily gaining momentum. Federated learning involves a possibly varying set of parties participating in a parallel training process through a centralized aggregator that has access only to the parties’ model parameters or gradients but not to the data itself. Compared to parallel stochastic gradient descent (SGD), federated learning aims at minimizing communication by parties performing a number of iterations locally before sending parameters to the aggregator. Federations tend to be diverse, leading to non-IID data across parties, and often include parties whose data can be considered to be outliers with respect to the others. Most algorithms, however, can trigger a failure of the training process itself when parties are too heterogeneous in precisely the settings where federated learning could have the greatest benefit. Personalization of federated model training, when judiciously performed, is one means of avoiding such training failure. In addition, personalization of federated training allows for greater accuracy on the data that matters most to each party. The majority of federated learning fusion algorithms are designed to produce a common solution for all parties. However, this is seldom the setting that motivates the use of federated learning. As also noted by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Mansour <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, an application (e.g. of sentence completion) for a user should be optimized for that user’s needs and not be identical across all users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We propose Fed+ (pronounced as FedPlus) to address the issues of avoiding training failure, increasing robustness to outliers and stragglers, and improving performance on the applications of interest where party-level data distributions need not be similar across parties. Fed+ unifies many algorithms and offers provably-convergent personalization and robustness; this is achieved through a problem formulation that allows the central server to employ robust ways of aggregating the local models while keeping the structure of local computation intact.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fed+ does not make explicit assumptions on the distributions of the local data, which are assumed private to each party. Instead, we assume a global shared parameter space with locally computed loss functions. Like some personalized methods, Fed+ allows for data heterogeneity by relaxing the requirement that the parties must reach a full consensus. The Fed+ theory is equipped to handle heterogeneous computing environments, including stragglers, without making additional assumptions; specifically, the convergence results cover the general setting where the number of local update steps across parties can vary.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of a federated learning aggregation method, it is important to assess it on the types of datasets on which it would be ultimately used. On the one hand, parties involved in federated learning training wish to enjoy improved accuracy on data from their own data populations. In addition, parties involved in federated model training also aim to train models that will transfer well. As such, it is crucial to evaluate algorithms on test sets that include some data from outside the party-specific training data. We thus illustrate the benefits of Fed+ on the synthetic dataset created for FedProx by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite> as well as on the LEAF datasets of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Caldas <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> to represent the party-specific dataset scenario. We also construct personalized FL datasets on a synthetic regression problem and from the well-known MNIST dataset to provide an assessment of transfer quality within a party-specific setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The contributions of this work are (i) the definition of a unified framework for robust, personalized federated learning, called Fed+; (ii) a convergence theory that covers the most important variants of the Fed+ algorithm, including convex and nonconvex loss functions, robust aggregation and stragglers; and (iii) a comprehensive set of numerical experiments on party-specific datasets with and without with transfer requirements, thus illustrating the benefit of Fed+ with respect to other federated learning algorithms, personalized and non-personalized.</p>

The most important difference between Fed+ and the above methods is that only Fed+ allows for robust aggregation, both in the definition of the algorithm and in the convergence theory, handling the resulting non-smooth optimization problem.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we illustrate the training failure that can occur in real-world federated learning settings on a federated reinforcement learning-based financial portfolio management problem. The key observation, see Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 Illustration of Training Failure in Federated Learning ‣ Robustness and Personalization in Federated Learning: A Unified Approach via Regularization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, is that replacing the local party models with a common, aggregate model at each round can lead to large spikes in model changes, triggering training failure for the federation as a whole. The figure shows the mean and standard deviation of the change in neural network parameter values before and after a federated learning aggregation step. FedAvg, RFA using the geometric median, coordinate-wise median, and FedProx are shown, as well as the no fusion case where each party trains independently on its own data, and the FedAvg+ version of Fed+. All the standard FL methods cause large spikes in the parameter change that do not occur without federated learning or with Fed+.</p>

Note that this example <em id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">does not involve adversarial parties or party failure</em>, as evident from the fact that single-party training (top curve) does not suffer failure.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We design the Fed+ framework to handle real-world federated learning settings better, including non-IID data across parties, parties having outlier data with respect to other parties, stragglers, in that updates are transmitted late, and an implicit requirement for the final trained model(s) to perform well on both each party’s own datasets as well as datasets whose distributions differ from the party’s training data. To accomplish these goals, Fed+ takes a robust, personalized approach to federated learning and, importantly, does not require all parties to converge to a single central point. Fed+ thus requires generalizing the objective of the federated learning training process, as follows.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fed+ has been designed to better handle the heterogeneity inherent in federated settings: the lack of IID data, the need for robustness to outliers and stragglers, and the requirement to perform well on party-specific data.
The Fed+ class of methods unifies numerous algorithms through a formulation that allows for robust ways of aggregating the local models whilst keeping the structure of local computation intact.
We provide convergence guarantees for Fed+ for convex and non-convex loss functions, robust aggregation, and for the case of stragglers.
Probably the most promising extension of this work would be an in-depth exploration of neural network layer-specific aggregation functions as made possible through the Fed+ formulation.</p>
