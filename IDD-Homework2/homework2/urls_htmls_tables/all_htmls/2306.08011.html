<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) naturally faces the problem of data heterogeneity in real-world scenarios, but this is often overlooked by studies on FL security and privacy. On the one hand, the effectiveness of backdoor attacks on FL may drop significantly under non-IID scenarios. On the other hand, malicious clients may steal private data through privacy inference attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to have a comprehensive perspective of data heterogeneity, backdoor, and privacy inference.
In this paper, we propose a novel privacy inference-empowered stealthy backdoor attack (PI-SBA) scheme for FL under non-IID scenarios.
Firstly, a diverse data reconstruction mechanism
based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed
to produce a supplementary dataset, which can improve the
attacker’s local data distribution and support more sophisticated
strategies for backdoor attacks.
Based on this, we design a source-specified backdoor learning (SSBL) strategy as a demonstration, allowing the adversary to arbitrarily specify which classes are susceptible to the backdoor trigger. Since the PI-SBA has an independent poisoned data synthesis process, it can be integrated into existing backdoor attacks to improve their effectiveness and stealthiness in non-IID scenarios. Extensive experiments based on MNIST, CIFAR10 and Youtube Aligned Face datasets demonstrate that the proposed PI-SBA scheme is effective in non-IID FL and stealthy against state-of-the-art defense methods.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) provides a new paradigm for cooperative learning, which allows multiple parties to jointly train a global model without sharing local private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
While providing better privacy protection, FL also exposes a larger attack surface than centralized learning. One of the most typical threats is from malicious clients who can launch poisoning attacks on the global model by uploading well-crafted local updates. The backdoor attack as a targeted poisoning attack is notoriously stealthy and threatening, which aims to induce the model to misbehave under specific circumstances while maintaining the original performance on the main task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, backdoor attacks have been extensively studied in centralized deep neural networks (DNNs) and many powerful variants have emerged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
For FL, the migration of backdoor attacks seems to be a simple and straightforward task. For example, initiated by the attempt of Bagdasaryan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, a series of studies demonstrate the possibility of backdooring FL in various ways <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
However, maintaining the backdoor effectiveness can be quite a challenge in such a complex distributed system. Here we list two main factors:</p>
<ul id="S1.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="S1.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">First, the updates from benign clients can weaken the impact of poisonous updates (especially when the proportion of malicious clients is quite small), and it makes the global model quickly forget the backdoor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To negate the benign updates’ effect, an explicit amplification strategy has been widely used <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. We also draw on this approach in the proposed scheme and further evaluate its effectiveness in section <a href="#S4" title="IV Experiments ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

<li id="S1.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Second, a more serious but often overlooked issue is that data heterogeneity can greatly reduce the effectiveness of backdoor attacks in FL. Data heterogeneity can lead to the overfitting of local models on the skewed local data so that the backdoor features will be suppressed. What’s worse, the difference between local malicious data distribution and global data distribution has a significant impact on the backdoor effectiveness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which must be considered when designing the attack strategy.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Through further analysis, we found that the existing backdoor attacks on FL have the following limitations: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">①</span> The issue of non-iid data mentioned above is not considered. Although we note that <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> attempted to alleviate the attacker’s data absence by introducing the GAN-based inference method as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, it can only restore the data of a single class, and only work in the special case where all class members are similar.
<span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">②</span> The triggers pattern used to control the backdoor behavior is missing in most existing so-called backdoor attacks in FL, which, however, is usually an important component in backdoor attacks on centralized DNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. We also note that a novel semantic backdoor is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> (e.g., using a striped wall background as a semantic trigger for “car” images), but this will greatly limit the attacker’s flexibility. We speculate that this is due to the fact that the features of explicit trigger patterns are prone to failure in the non-IID scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, to help break through the limitations faced by backdoor attackers in the non-IID FL, we propose a privacy inference-empowered stealthy backdoor attack (PI-SBA) scheme leveraging a GANs-based diverse data inference mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which produces a supplementary dataset consisting of diverse generated samples to reduce the gap between local and global data distributions.
To make it clear, in this work, we mainly focus on a typical non-IID scenario—the label distribution skew <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> in cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, where a handful of clients (usually 10 to 100) cooperate to train a shared model with much larger datasets. As is shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, each client (including the attacker) only has access to a subset of all data classes. It is a common case in FL systems composed of large organizations such as hospitals or banks that own data with different labels from different sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Based on this, we further design a more flexible and insidious source-specified backdoor learning (SSBL) strategy that can arbitrarily specify which classes are susceptible and which are not.
It should be noted that the SSBL strategy not only demonstrates that our GANs-based diverse data inference mechanism can assist attackers to carry out more sophisticated backdoor attacks despite the absence of relevant original data, but also corresponds to a realistic threat model.
For example, in an FL system consisting of a group of commercial companies with different user groups, for the purpose of vicious competition, the attacker only compromises the user groups of the rival companies, leaving the rest immune, which is more insidious than injecting a generic backdoor.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We believe that our GANs-based diverse data inference mechanism as well as the SSBL strategy is not an isolated work, but can be integrated into existing backdoor attacks (.e.g, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>) on FL to help improve their effectiveness and concealment under non-IID scenarios. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed PI-SBA scheme validate that <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Inadvertently-leaked private data can be used to backdoor the FL models</span>. This may lead to benign users in FL systems being stigmatized as backdoor attackers.</p>

Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed an edge-case backdoor attack and first theoretically verified that if adversarial example attacks are effective against models in FL, so are backdoor attacks. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> introduced a generative poisoning attack called PoisonGAN for situations where the attacker does not have access to the training data, and reproduced the backdoor attack in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Considering multiple colluding malicious clients, Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed to utilize a composite global trigger formed by several local triggers to conduct a distributed backdoor attack (DBA) on FL.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To alleviate the problem of missing data for backdoor attackers in non-IID scenarios, we also investigate privacy inference attacks in FL.
Melis et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> demonstrated that the model updates could leak unintended information about clients’ training data, and such leakage risk makes it possible for server-side attackers to reconstruct the original training data from collected updates.
Wang et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> devised a framework incorporating the generative adversarial network (GAN) with a multitask discriminator to simultaneously discriminates category, reality, and client identity of input samples. However, server-side privacy inference attacks require higher attacker capabilities.
Hitaj et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> extended the model inversion attack as a client-side privacy inference attack using the GAN to generate the targeted class representatives in a collaborative learning system. This attack exploited the real-time nature of the FL system and regards the global model as a discriminator to train the generator. However, considering the attack assumption and effect comprehensively, the above methods can not be directly applied to launch an effective backdoor attack on FL under non-IID data scenarios.</p>

Some existing works assume a server-side attacker, who can steal private data through collected updates or directly manipulate the aggregated global model, while we consider a more challenging scenario: the attacker is on the client and the data distribution among all clients is label distribution non-IID, i.e., each client only has a subset of all classes as described in section <a href="#S3.SS1.SSS1" title="III-A1 Cross-silo FL with Label Distribution Non-IID Data ‣ III-A Preliminaries ‣ III Proposed Method ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span>1</span></a>.</p>

In the first stage, the attacker aims to generate high-quality samples of diverse data classes from the global model (especially those not locally available) to improve its local data distribution.
In the second stage, the attacker’s goal is to inject an advanced backdoor that only works on the specified classes into the model, so as to determine the susceptibility and immunity of different clients to the backdoor trigger.</p>

To solve this problem, we leverage a pre-poisoning strategy to actively inject a small number of generated samples that are mislabeled as the backdoor target class, as the negative samples in each training round. With this pre-poisoning strategy, the quality of generated data will be significantly improved and then the stealthiness and robustness of proposed backdoor methods is also improved.</p>

In this part, we first present the results for data inference, and then further evaluate the improvements our method brings to regular backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> under different heterogeneity indices.</p>

As we expected, our approach performs better in generating samples with both authenticity and diversity, while the diversity is not only reflected in generating different classes each time but also in the difference of samples in each class. In contrast, the method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> can only recreate a single class where all samples are similar.
We also briefly demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-poisoning strategy in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-C GANs-based Diverse Data Inference ‣ III Proposed Method ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and found that it can effectively promote faster and more stable generator training.
An experimental finding is that the interpolation-based generator has better visual effects than the deconvolution-based one (e.g., DCGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>), because the latter tends to show the checkerboard artifacts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Improvement.</span> In order to more intuitively understand how data heterogeneity affects backdoor attack effectiveness and to what extent our data inference methods can help attackers alleviate the limitations, we conducted a set of experiments by varying the heterogeneity index.
We choose the typical model-replacement backdoor attack in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and PGD backdoor attack in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> as the baselines for CIFAR10 and MNIST, respectively. The data poisoning rate for malicious clients is set to 50%.
We run 10 times experiments for each heterogeneity index, picking a different backdoor target class each time, and use box-and-whisker plots to report the ASR in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Effectiveness of GANs-based Diverse Data Inference ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. We can easily find the larger the heterogeneity index, the more ASR drops. However, when combined with our data inference scheme, the ASR becomes stable and can be increased by 20%–60% in the case of extreme heterogeneity.
We believe that there are two main reasons. The first is that in the absence of data classes, the trigger feature can not generalize well and only work on the data classes that have participated in the backdoor training. Another reason is that benign clients also face the heterogeneity problem and tend to produce overfitting updates, which will further suppress the backdoor feature injected by the attacker.</p>

In order to visualize this kind of “differential treatment”, we use the confusion matrix in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-C Effectiveness of SSBL ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> to show the effectiveness of SSBL.
WLOG, We specified 5, 3, and 1 victim classes for MNIST, CIFAR10, and YAF datasets, respectively, and set the first class as the backdoor target. Note that we have no restrictions on the choice of the target because the data from the target class are not involved during the attack process.
As shown in the heatmaps, our SSBL is able to greatly reduce the model performance on the specified class, while the influence on non-specified classes is much smaller (even with no effect on some classes).</p>

From Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-C Effectiveness of SSBL ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, we can see as the number of specified classes increases, the MTA is almost unaffected, which is consistent with the general characteristics of backdoor attacks. However, both the ASR and BS show a downward trend, which seems counter-intuitive, because the regular backdoor can be regarded as a special case of our SSBL with all classes specified. We conjecture that the reason lies in the adversarial relationship between the specified and non-specified classes. Specifically, in a traditional backdoor attack or the SSBL with a single class specified, this adversarial relationship is overwhelming, but in SSBL with half of the specified class, this relationship becomes balanced, making it more difficult for a trigger to find the boundary where it can distinguish them.</p>

It is worth noting that since we can achieve a more effective backdoor attack with the help of our data inference mechanisms, the required amplification factor is much smaller than existing works (even up to 40 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>).
As we can see, update amplification is very important for the attack effectiveness. For example, a simple 3x amplification can increase the ASR by as much as 50% on MNIST. However, excessive amplification may damage the performance of the global model, leaving the backdoor attacker exposed.
In addition, when <math id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝜆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1c">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math>=10, both MNIST and YAF datasets show a decrease in ASR, which may be due to the effect of the penalty term in our source-specified loss function being amplified at the same time.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although there have been many studies on defense strategies against backdoor attacks in FL, such as FoolsGold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, FLGUARD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and FLAME <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, few of them are applicable to label distribution non-IID scenarios.
There are two main reasons.
First, most defense methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> are based on the idea of anomaly detection, i.e., to discover and eliminate malicious updates through similarity comparison or clustering, etc. However, there are naturally significant differences in client updates under non-IID scenarios<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, making such methods invalid.
Second, the secure aggregation mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> adopted by many FL systems makes it impossible for defenders to examine the clients’ updates.
Therefore, we focus on post-training backdoor detection to evaluate the stealth of our attack in this work.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first use the popular Neural Cleanse (NC) method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to detect the global model that has been attacked by our SSBL strategy in FL.
The NC leverages a gradient descent-based approach to generate a possible trigger for each class. After that, the NC uses the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) as the outlier detection algorithm to detect the reversed triggers and identify the backdoor target class.
We use class 0 as the backdoor target in MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, and specify 3 classes as the victims. The trigger restoration effect is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IV-E1 Stealth against Neural Cleanse ‣ IV-E Stealth Analysis of SSBL Strategy Against Defense Method ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.

By analyzing the silhouette score of the clustering results, the AC method can distinguish the clean and poisoned classes.
As we can see from <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-E2 Stealth against Activation Clustering ‣ IV-E Stealth Analysis of SSBL Strategy Against Defense Method ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Privacy Inference-Empowered Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Federated Learning under Non-IID Scenarios" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, the AC method fails to detect most of the time but is more effective and more stable than the NC method. The reason may be that AC can identify anomalous samples based on clustering regardless of the number of specified source classes.
However, the AC approach has a serious drawback, i.e., the defender needs to access a large amount of training data including poisoning data, which is difficult in FL because of the violation of privacy protection.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our SSBL strategy narrows the attack scope on the backdoor source classes, making it more difficult to detect.
But there are still some defenses that can be effective, especially when the defenders are aware of the source-specific nature of the backdoor attack. For example, the NC defender can reverse engineer the triggers of all possible source-target label pairs to detect the anomaly ones at the cost of a significant increase in computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond that, more vigilant defenders can assume the model has been injected with a backdoor and go straight to backdoor elimination such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. We speculate that this may be effective because our SSBL strategy does not consider optimizing for backdoor persistence. But it should be noted that such coarse-grained defense may come at the cost of degradation in the performance of the original model.</p>

Data inference utilizes the inherent characteristics of the DNN model, i.e., a well-trained model can memorize information of training data. In this sense, as long as the clients have white-box access to the global model, data inference attacks are unavoidable.
Therefore, a defense idea is to restrict the client’s access to the global model during the training phase and only provide an interface for uploading data, so as to prevent the client-side attacker from stealing additional information.</p>

In cross-device FL, the clients consist of many devices (sometimes millions), each with a small dataset. In this case, the attacker will face more extreme resource-constrained challenges. How to optimize our data inference mechanism and design new attack strategies (such as multiple client collusion) remains to be further explored in such a more complex distributed environment.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a privacy inference-empowered backdoor attack scheme for non-IID FL, which enables the client-side attacker to launch a more stealthy but effective backdoor attack under the label distribution skew scenario.
Firstly, a GANs-based diverse data inference mechanism is proposed to generate private data, which uses a pre-poisoning strategy to improve the quality of generated data.
Secondly, we further design a source-specified backdoor learning strategy, which allows the attacker to arbitrarily specify which classes are susceptible to the backdoor trigger.
Extensive experiments are implemented based on MNIST, CIFAR10, and YouTube Aligned Face datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. By our diverse data inference mechanism,
we can increase the ASR of regular backdoors by over 60% when it is ineffective due to data absence. And the SSBL strategy can successfully evade state-of-the-art backdoor detection methods.
Overall, our scheme presents higher feasibility and flexibility and is compatible with other backdoor attacks to improve their effectiveness and stealthiness, which can provide strong support for future research on backdoor attacks in non-IID FL.</p>
