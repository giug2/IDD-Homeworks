<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In Federated Learning (FL), with parameter aggregated by a central node, the communication overhead is a substantial concern. To circumvent this limitation and alleviate the single point of failure within the FL framework, recent studies have introduced Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) as a viable alternative. Considering the device heterogeneity, and energy cost associated with parameter aggregation, in this paper, the problem on how to efficiently leverage the limited resources available to enhance the model performance is investigated. Specifically, we formulate a problem that minimizes the loss function of DFL while considering energy and latency constraints. The proposed solution involves optimizing the number of local training rounds across diverse devices with varying resource budgets. To make this problem tractable, we first analyze the convergence of DFL with edge devices with different rounds of local training. The derived convergence bound reveals the impact of the rounds of local training on the model performance. Then, based on the derived bound, the closed-form solutions of rounds of local training in different devices are obtained. Meanwhile, since the solutions require the energy cost of aggregation as low as possible, we modify different graph-based aggregation schemes to solve this energy consumption minimization problem, which can be applied to different communication scenarios. Finally, a DFL framework which jointly considers the optimized rounds of local training and the energy-saving aggregation scheme is proposed. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm achieves a better performance than the conventional schemes with fixed rounds of local training, and consumes less energy than other traditional aggregation schemes.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the present era, the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to an unprecedented generation and collection of vast volumes of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Simultaneously, the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research necessitates extensive datasets to train machine learning models. Hence, it becomes imperative to investigate efficient strategies for harnessing these data resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, the transmission of all data to a central node proves impractical due to limitations in communication overhead and privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To mitigate these challenges and facilitate the effective utilization of privacy-sensitive data, the concept of federated learning (FL) emerged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. FL introduces a distributed learning paradigm that aims to conserve communication resources while enabling collaborative model training on distributed data sources. In FL, devices utilize their available data to train a shared machine learning model by transmitting local model parameters or gradients, thereby avoiding the need to upload all devices’ data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, FL faces notable hurdles in terms of communication efficiency as the number of participating devices and model parameters continues to grow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. To address this issue, the majority of research efforts have been directed towards parameter compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, device selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and power/bandwidth allocation algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> within the FL framework. Despite these endeavors, the conventional FL paradigms continue to rely on a central node for parameter aggregation, leading to heightened communication overhead and vulnerability associated with a single point of failure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. As a means to overcome these limitations and mitigate the risks, recent investigations have explored and introduced the decentralized federated learning (DFL) as a promising alternative approach.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In DFL, parameter aggregation is achieved through direct communication between adjacent devices. Following a sufficient number of communication rounds, the average parameters are synchronized across all participating nodes. Subsequently, each node can iteratively update these aggregated parameters based on its local dataset, until the commencement of the next aggregation round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. DFL has demonstrated its versatility and effectiveness as a robust and efficient framework, finding applications in diverse fields such as recommended systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, vehicle trajectories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the Industrial IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and satellite communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Moreover, some analyses have been conducted to examine the convergence of DFL, allowing for comprehensive performance evaluations across varying scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. These studies have also delved into investigating the impact of communication conditions, including channel fading and noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, and packet errors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, on the performance of DFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite increasing interest and efforts to address challenges in DFL over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, a research gap exists, specifically in the realm of device heterogeneity. This heterogeneity, encompassing statistical and system heterogeneity, poses practical issues on the DFL. Statistical heterogeneity involves non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data across devices, potentially affecting the model performance during aggregation. Some aggregation schemes address statistical heterogeneity by selecting neighbors with similar distributions for communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. While statistical heterogeneity has been extensively studied, device heterogeneity has received insufficient attention. Variability in device hardware leads to differences in computation and communication capacity and resources, posing inefficiencies when applying the same setting across devices or times. A notable consequence is the straggler effect, causing high latency due to varying computation capacities among devices. An algorithm proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> addressed this issue by dynamically adjusting the local training frequency. However, beyond variable computation capacities, the DFL system, often implemented over wireless networks, faces heterogeneity in computation and communication resources, including energy costs. This heterogeneity can restrict total local training rounds and updating iterations. However, how to set the limited local training rounds in each iteration to improve the performance has not been paid attention in previous works, since the heterogeneity of resources cost does not appear to have explored this crucial aspect. Considering diverse energy cost budgets among devices, the number of local training rounds in one iteration is influenced not only by convergence time constraints but also by available energy allocation for training. Ensuring more energy for local training requires designing an energy-efficient aggregation scheme to reduce transmission energy costs and consensus errors. Unfortunately, only a limited number of works have specifically investigated and addressed the concern about energy consumption on aggregation in the domain of DFL. Notable examples include the application of a quantization scheme based on random linear coding (RLC) to reduce the transmission energy cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, the proposal of a balanced communication and computation cost allocation scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the design of an energy-aware algorithm to reduce communication energy costs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and the development of a bandwidth allocation algorithm to enhance model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Despite extensive exploration and discussion of energy budget heterogeneity in the context of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, these concerns have received limited attention within the realm of DFL. The lack of focused investigation into these issues poses potential detrimental effects to the DFL performance, especially in resource-constrained communication scenarios.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by these observations, our paper aim to explore the efficient utilization of limited energy resources on each device to enhance the DFL model performance. With fixed total local training rounds due to limited energy budgets, our focus is to design a scheme to allocate these rounds across iterations. To be specific, our goal is to optimize the loss function of the DFL with various rounds of local training on different devices. Therefore, since in the DFL framework where devices have their individual recourse budgets is considered, each device can adjusts its own rounds of local training between two aggregations. To achieve this goal, we formulate a problem to minimize the loss function of DFL by optimizing the rounds of local training in each device, with joint energy and latency cost constraints on each device. To make this problem tractable, we analyze the convergence with the considered DFL framework, which can help us reformulate the original problem as minimizing the derived convergence bound. Furthermore, solving this problem also requires minimizing the energy consumption on the aggregation. Thus, some energy-saving aggregation schemes are applied in our proposed DFL framework, which can reduce the energy cost on the aggregation with different communication conditions (e.g., the channel information between two devices is available or not).

DFL obtains the value of the global loss function by an iterative algorithm. In the iterative algorithm, this value is obtained through a series of steps. Each round of iteration involves two fundamental steps: local training and parameter aggregation, as shown in Fig. 1. Specifically, in one iteration, each device updates its local parameter vector via several rounds of local training. Then, all updated parameters are aggregated among the devices and each device begins the next iteration based on the aggregated parameters. Furthermore, it is easy to check that, when all local loss functions are minimized by this iterative algorithm, the global loss function achieve its minimization.

The complete DFL system are shown in Algorithm 1. Indeed, in DFL, the absence of a central node poses a challenge for devices to obtain the aggregated parameters by (<a href="#S2.E7" title="In II-A DFL Over Wireless Networks ‣ II System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Adaptive Decentralized Federated Learning in Energy and Latency Constrained Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>) directly. Instead, as mentioned before, devices must engage in communication with their neighbors to averaged the parameters. This process continues until all devices have successfully synchronized the parameters from all participating devices. Thus, modeling the communication between devices is also essential in DFL, which is shown in the following.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.3" class="ltx_p">Given the independent energy costs among devices, it is crucial to focus on the individual energy consumption within the DFL framework. Despite this, the collaborative nature of the DFL, where devices collectively train a global model, necessitates the consideration of the entire system’s latency. In the DFL system, parameter updates follow a synchronous approach, initiating the global aggregation phase only after all devices complete their local updates.

The goal of this optimization problem is to achieve a cost-efficient DFL system that maximizes the utilization of available resources while minimizing the global loss function, thereby enhancing the overall performance of DFL. This problem aims to strike a balance between achieving a high model accuracy and optimizing the resource utilization in terms of the energy. By solving this problem, we can obtain a local training scheme with the optimal numbers of local training rounds in each iteration on all devices. This scheme not only consider a better performance of DFL, but also achieve a trade-off between performance and resource costs.</p>

Nevertheless, due to the inherent diversity of loss functions across different machine learning models and scenarios, obtaining a general closed-form expression for the loss function about the number of rounds of local training is challenging. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach by deriving the convergence bound of DFL. Similar to the global loss function, this convergence bound also serves as an evaluation metric to assess the model performance and offers insights into how the number of rounds of local training affects the overall performance of the DFL system.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Corollary 1 reveals the best case of the convergence rate of DFL. Specifically, when the strongly convex and Lipschitz smooth assumptions hold, in the i.i.d. case, the DFL converges in a linear rate. This result is consistent with previous works on FL and DFL, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. It means that, although the local training rounds are different among the devices, the convergence of DFL system is the same.</p>

Based on this link, one of the devices in the DFL obtain the aggregated parameters. Then, their parameters are transmitted to all others by the same link. This process is summarized as an example in Fig. 2. In this example, the least energy cost transmission link is generated by the Algorithm 2 at first. Then all devices transmit their local parameters over this link to the device 3. Finally, after aggregating all parameters, device 3 transmits them to others through the same link to reach a consensus among all devices.

However, when the scenario is more general, such as unknown channel information or time-varying channel, considering the Case 2 is also necessary. In addition, as introduced before, the aggregation scheme in Case 1 is a sequential aggregation approach, thereby facilitating a potentially slower consensus time compared with the aggregation scheme based on Ring-AllReduce or randomized gossip algorithm.</p>

It means that, at the beginning of the DFL training process, setting less rounds of local training in one iteration can achieve a better performance. This result reflects that, since there is significant divergence in the gradient at the beginning of DFL, increasing the rounds of local training in one iteration would possibly lead to further divergence, which potentially leads to the worse model performance.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.5" class="ltx_p">We consider a DFL system with 20 devices. Each device trains a local machine learning model to finish some classification tasks, based on its local datasets, which is divided by the global datasets. Thus, the prediction accuracy is used to evaluate the model performance. Specifically, to make our simulation more complete, we consider three different datasets, which are MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10. They correspond to grayscale image data (10 labels and 62 labels), and color image data, respectively. Based on these datasets, two different models, which are Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are trained to finish these tasks. In addition, to guarantee that all proposed aggregation schemes can be evaluated, we consider three connection topologies among devices, which are ring, quasi-ring and grid with 2 columns, since the ring topology is the sub-graph of all these three topologies. Besides, for all devices, their transmit power <math id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p_{t}=1" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">p</mi><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><mo id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑝</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">𝑡</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">p_{t}=1</annotation></semantics></math>W.

To reveal the impact of how number of devices and connection topology on the convergence rate, we compare the number of iterations required for the convergence of DFL with 5, 10, 15, 20 devices under the ring and quasi-ring topologies. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 6.</p>

To provide a comprehensive comparison, we evaluatethe test accuracy using the MNIST dataset with MLP and CIFAR-10 with CNN. Unlike the proposed scheme, all baselines require the specification of the number of rounds of local training in each iteration. Therefore, we vary this number from 3, 5, 7, to 9 to observe the results under different system settings.</p>

This superiority arises from its more efficient local training round allocation scheme and the ability to avoid consensus errors. Additionally, the advantages of the proposed scheme are more pronounced in complex tasks compared to simpler datasets.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have designed a DFL framework, which can utilize the limited computation and communication resources of each device to enhance the global model performance. To achieve this goal, we have formulated an optimization problem, which aims to minimize the global loss function by allocating the limited total rounds of local training into different iterations. To solve this problem, We have derived the convergence bound and convergence rate of the DFL framework with different rounds of local training among iterations and devices to relax it as a tractable problem. By solving the reformulation problem, some different aggregation schemes based on the connection graph topology of the devices are proposed to reduce the energy cost during the aggregation under the various cases with different communication conditions. In addition, the closed-form solutions for rounds of limited total rounds of local training allocation among different iterations and devices are derived, which have been provided a guideline about improving the performance of DFL by leverage the constrained resources efficiency. Our theoretical analysis is confirmed by the simulation results. The comparison results have shown that, the proposed adaptive local training scheme can achieve a better performance than some benchmarks and conventional schemes, and the graph-based aggregation scheme cost less energy than the widely-used randomized gossip algorithm.</p>
