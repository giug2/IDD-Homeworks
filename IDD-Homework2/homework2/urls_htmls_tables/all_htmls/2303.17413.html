<p id="1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm for training models across multiple edge devices holding local data sets, without explicitly exchanging the data. Recently, over-the-air (OTA) FL has been suggested to reduce the bandwidth and energy consumption, by allowing the users to transmit their data simultaneously over a Multiple Access Channel (MAC).
However, this approach results in channel noise directly affecting the optimization procedure, which may degrade the accuracy of the trained model.
In this paper we jointly exploit the prior distribution of local weights and the channel distribution, and develop an OTA FL algorithm based on a Bayesian approach for signal aggregation. Our proposed algorithm, dubbed Bayesian Air Aggregation Federated learning (BAAF), is shown to effectively mitigate noise and fading effects induced by the channel.
To handle statistical heterogeneity of users data, which is a second major challenge in FL, we extend BAAF to allow for appropriate local updates by the users and develop the Controlled Bayesian Air Aggregation Federated-learning (COBAAF) algorithm.
In addition to using a Bayesian approach to average the channel output, COBAAF controls the drift in local updates using a judicious design of correction terms.
We analyze the convergence of the learned global model using BAAF and COBAAF in noisy and heterogeneous environment, showing their ability to achieve a convergence rate similar to that achieved over error-free channels. Simulation results demonstrate the improved convergence of BAAF and COBAAF over existing algorithms in machine learning tasks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, machine learning algorithms have given rise to advances in multiple fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Since these algorithms are data driven, their success hinges on vast amounts of training data. Nowadays, a lot of this data is generated on edge devices such as mobile phones, sensors, vehicles, and medical devices. The common strategy is to gather these samples at a computationally powerful server, which uses them to train its model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Due to privacy and locality concerns, uploading of data sets, such as images and text messages, may be undesirable. Furthermore, the communication link between edge devices and the server can be heavily burdened by sharing of massive data sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These difficulties can be tackled by exploiting the increased computational power of mobile devices via mobile edge computing, in which training and inference is performed directly at network edges without having to share the raw data. In such systems, learning from distributed data and communicating between the edge server and devices are two critical and coupled aspects. This motivates the edge learning framework of federated learning (FL), which features distributed learning at edge devices with centralized aggregations, orchestrated by an edge server, and is the focus of growing research attention over the last few years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
The fact that the complete data set is not available to the server leads to several core challenges that are not encountered in conventional machine learning methods. In this paper we focus on two of the main challenges in FL: Noise induced by the shared channel due to the communication bottleneck, and statistical heterogeneity of users’ data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The communication bottleneck in FL arises from the need for a large number of users to repeatedly and concurrently send their intermediate learned models (e.g., deep neural networks weights) to the server over shared and resource-limited wireless networks.
A commonly adopted strategy to tackle this challenge is to model the wireless channel as a set of independent error-free bit-limited links between the users and the server, e.g., by using frequency division multiplexing (FDM), and then to apply methods of compressing the conveyed model parameters via quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
This, however, results in each user being assigned a dedicated bandwidth which decreases with the number of participating users, increasing the energy consumption required to meet a desirable communication rate, and decreasing in the overall throughput and training speed.
An alternative approach is to allow the users to simultaneously utilize the complete temporal and spectral resources of the uplink Multiple Access Channel (MAC) in a non-orthogonal manner, and in this way exploit the inherent aggregation carried out by the shared channel as a form of over-the-air (OTA) computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, OTA has been studied in the FL context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
This approach allows each transmitter to utilize the complete available channel resources, e.g., bandwidth, regardless of the number of users.
However, this results in <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">channel noise</em> directly affecting the model weights. This may degrade the accuracy of the trained model as SGD is known to be sensitive to noisy observations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the authors considered scenario where the model updates are sparse with an identical sparsity pattern, which is not likely to hold when the data is heterogeneous.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the authors used a Bayesian aggregation procedure to handle the channel noise and fading. However, they considered distributed application of full gradient descent optimization over noisy channels with a single local step at each round, which is less efficient in terms of communication and computation resources as compared to FedAvg.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In our previous work, we proposed the COTAF algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> which facilitates high throughput FL over wireless channels, while preserving the convergence properties of the common FedAvg method for distributed learning, by introducing a time-varying precoding at the users.
While COTAF has demonstrated some success in handling noise, in this work we take an additional step towards better noise reduction. By exploiting the prior distribution of local weights and the channel distribution, we address the noise challenge in OTA FL using a Bayesian approach, introducing the Bayesian Air Aggregation Federated-learning (BAAF) algorithm. Similarly to previous OTA FL methods, BAAF utilizes the fact that the model updates in FL are typically transmitted to be averaged, and uses OTA transmissions for increasing the throughput when operating over a shared channel. The transmission is then judiciously designed such that the received noisy signal at the server follows a Bayesian combining strategy. Specifically, we jointly exploit the distribution of the local models and the communication channels when aggregating the noisy local models received by the server, and estimate the noise-free sum of local models. Under the premise that the prior distributions of the local models are jointly Gaussian and the channel is Gaussian with block fading, this aggregation method is optimal in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) per communication round.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.2" class="ltx_p">We analyze theoretically the convergence of models trained by BAAF, when the objective is a strongly convex and smooth function with bounded gradients, as commonly assumed for purposes of theoretical analysis in FL convergence studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.

Specifically, BAAF achieves the same convergence rate as FedAvg, with an additional noise term which depends on the MSE of our aggregation strategy and decays as <math id="S1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1/R" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mi id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">R</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1"><divide id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1"></divide><cn type="integer" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2">1</cn><ci id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑅</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1c">1/R</annotation></semantics></math>, where <math id="S1.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="R" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml">R</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1">𝑅</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1c">R</annotation></semantics></math> is the number of communication rounds.

We also analyze the performance of BAAF numerically, and demonstrate its improved performance over conventional OTA FL and over the COTAF algorithm.</p>

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our second contribution is the extension of our results to FL with statistical heterogeneity among users’ data sets.
Statistical heterogeneity implies that the data generating distributions vary among different sets of users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. This is often the case in FL, as the data available at each user’s device is likely to be personalized. Statistical heterogeneity implies that when training several instances of a model on multiple edge devices, each instance may be biased.
While FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is a very popular algorithm for FL, implementing it on heterogeneous data results in slow and unstable convergence due to the drift in the local updates.
Several solutions have been suggested to address statistical heterogeneity, such as adding a regularizer to ensure users updates remain close <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, using a primal-dual optimization perspective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, and more <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>

This strategy successfully overcomes heterogeneity and converges in a significantly smaller number of communication rounds compared to FedAvg. However, SCAFFOLD is implemented in an ideal scenario assuming that the received local models at the server are error-free.
Here, we implement the technique of control variates over noisy channels, and analyze the trade-off between the errors corresponding to heterogeneity and channel noise on the convergence rate. To handle statistical heterogeneity of users data, we extend BAAF and develop the COBAAF algorithm.
First, we use control variates in the local updates of the users to address the drift induced by the statistical heterogeneity of the data. Then, similarly to BAAF, we use OTA transmission for both models and controls variates with an appropriate precoding, and implement minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation to mitigate the noise effect. Finally, the estimated global model and control vairates are distributed to the users for another round.</p>

Characterizing the prior distribution of local weights is very challenging because it not only depends on the loss function but also on the underlying distribution of data samples. To overcome this difficulty, we model the distribution of the local weights as a Gaussian prior distribution with a proper moment matching technique.

Note that COTAF uses precoding but does not implement Bayesian aggregation, thus the gap between BAAF and COTAF indicates the performance gain as a result of the Bayesian aggregation scheme.
We also observe that COBAAF outperforms BAAF and COTAF. This implies that COBAAF indeed reduces the variance induced by heterogeneity using the control variates compared to BAAF and COTAF that do not use this technique. Note that BAAF uses precoding and implements Bayesian aggregation but does not use control variates in the local updates, thus the gap between COBAAF and BAAF indicates the performance gain as a result of the control variates.

It is emphasized that when using orthogonal transmissions,
as implicitly assumed when using the conventional SCAFFOLD scheme, increasing the number of users implies that the channel resources must be shared among a larger number of users, hence the throughput of each user decreases. However, in OTA FL the throughput is independent of the number of users.

The gap between BAAF and COTAF indicates the performance gain as a result of the Bayesian aggregation scheme. Finally, we also observe that BAAF achieves performances within a minor gap from that of FedAvg (purple curve) carried over ideal orthogonal noiseless channels (which has great performances in the homogeneous case).</span></p>

By employing precoding and Bayesian aggregation, COBBAF is able to almost achieve the performance of SCAFFOLD over a noiseless channel.</span></p>

Our proposed BAAF algorithm is based on a rigorous Bayesian approach for signal aggregation to mitigate the noise and fading effects induced by the channel. To handle heterogeneity, we developed COBAAF, which extends BAAF and uses a control variates technique. We rigorously prove that the BAAF and COBAAF converge to the loss minimizing model with the same asymptotic convergence rate of FedAvg </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S6.p1.1.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a><span id="S6.p1.1.3.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">]</span></cite><span id="S6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> and SCAFFOLD </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S6.p1.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a><span id="S6.p1.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">]</span></cite><span id="S6.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> (respectively) without communication constraints. The strong performances of COBAAF are achieved by combining the transmission and Bayesian aggregation scheme, with proper updates at the user side.
