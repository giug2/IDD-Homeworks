<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">We investigate resource allocation scheme to reduce the energy consumption of federated learning (FL) in the integrated fog-cloud computing enabled Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. In the envisioned system, IoT devices are connected with the centralized cloud server (CS) via multiple fog
access points (F-APs). We consider two different scenarios for training the local models. In the first
scenario, local models are trained at the IoT devices and the F-APs upload the local model
parameters to the CS. In the second scenario, local models are trained at the F-APs based on the collected data from the IoT devices and the F-APs collaborate with the CS for updating the model parameters. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy-consumption of both scenarios subject to FL time constraint. Towards this goal, we devise a joint optimization of scheduling of IoT devices with the F-APs, transmit power allocation, computation frequency allocation at the devices and F-APs and decouple it into two subproblems. In the
first subproblem, we optimize the IoT device scheduling and power allocation, while in the second subproblem, we optimize the computation frequency allocation. For each scenario, we develop a conflict graph based solution to
iteratively solve the two subproblems. Simulation results show that the
proposed two schemes achieve a considerable performance
gain in terms of the energy consumption minimization. The presented simulation results interestingly reveal that for a large number of IoT devices and large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at the IoT devices instead of the F-APs.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) leads to the unprecedented growth of the connected IoT devices in the wireless networks and significant rise of several computation demanding applications, such as interactive gaming, virtual/augmented reality, image/video processing. Cloud computing provides an efficient computation platform for executing the aforementioned applications. However, cloud computing requires efficient offloading of computation intensive tasks from the energy-constrained mobile devices to the cloud server (CS) of enormous computation capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In particular, the offloading of a task to a distant CS increases latency and security risk (e.g., important data should not be offloaded to CSs that are located outside a national territory) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Hence, the benefit of cloud computing is diminished for the latency-sensitive and security critical applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Fog computing provides a complementary solution to the contemporary cloud computing by reducing the distance between the computing CS and mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In fog computing systems, fog access points (F-APs), with certain storage and computation capabilities, are deployed at the network edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. As a result, mobile devices can offload the computation intensive tasks directly to the nearby F-APs instead of a distant CS, leading to the low-latency and fast access services. Moreover, an integration of fog and cloud computing provides a powerful computation and communication platform for the large number of IoT devices. Such an integrated architecture is referred as integrated fog-cloud computing (FCC)-enabled IoT system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The integrated FCC provides powerful computation architecture for the IoT device, and it benefits from the centralized signal processing at the CS.
Thereby, the integrated FCC can efficiently provide the required quality-of-service (QoS) for the emerging IoT applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the data driven decision making becomes an integral part of IoT networks, thanks to the availability of the enormous data and advancement of the devices’ computing power. In particular, machine learning algorithms are extensively used to predict traffic congestion, user behavior, and QoS of users by analyzing large-scale data collected from the IoT devices. In conventional ML, the collected data from IoT devices (e.g., images, videos, and recorded audios) are offloaded to and processed in the centralized CSs, where
the learning models are trained. Such a centralized ML approach is confronted by the huge traffic burden in the wireless links between IoT devices and core network. In addition, the privacy of users’ sensitive data is impeded.
Therefore, the conventional centralized learning method is inefficient for next generation IoT network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Federated learning (FL) has been emerged as an efficient decentralized learning mechanism that allows multiple network edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In FL, the network edge devices train learning models locally based on local data. In contrast to the centralized learning mechanism, the devices only share updated model parameters with the CS. Subsequently, the CS calculates the global model parameter by aggregating local model updates from edge network. The local and global parameters are updated iteratively until convergence. By distributing the learning tasks between the network edge and centralized CSs, FL not only reduces the huge traffic burden over wireless channel, but also protects privacy of IoT data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the availability of distributed computing resources, an integrated FCC system provides a convenient platform to implement FL in wireless networks. In fact, using FL in integrated FCC system, the QoS of users can be significantly improved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, the channel impairments and interference present the key challenges to implement FL over wireless networks. Specifically, the FL training loss and convergence time jointly depends on selection of the collaborating devices, spectrum resource allocation, power allocation, and computation capability of the collaborating devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. It is also imperative to reduce the energy consumption of the IoT devices participating in FL process. Particularly, IoT devices consume both communication and computation energy when the local models are trained at the IoT devices. To save the computation energy consumption, fog computing resources can be leveraged for local learning. However, in such a scenario, the communication energy consumption can be increased as the IoT devices need to upload a large amount of data to nearby F-APs with a strict latency constraint. To this end, we consider two different scenarios where the local models are trained either at the IoT devices or F-APs. For both scenarios, we develop resource allocation mechanisms to reduce energy consumption of FL with strict delay constraints.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Related works on communication-efficient FL:</span> The performance of a decentralized ML depends on the optimization of wireless links between the network edge devices and parameter server (CS or fog computing nodes). Hence, it is imperative to optimally design the learning-centric resource allocation schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In the recent literature, the design of communication-efficient FL was extensively studied. Leveraging the grouping of network edge devices and a decentralized group alternating direction method of multipliers, a jointly communication efficient and fast converging FL algorithm was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. To enhance the accuracy and convergence of FL, it is imperative to enhance the number of collaborating edge devices while using the available spectrum resources efficiently. To this end, a collaborative FL framework was proposed that allows resource constrained IoT devices to upload model parameters to the nearby devices instead of the distance CS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Moreover, a joint scheduling of network edge devices and radio resource blocks (RRBs) was studied to minimize the FL loss function via applying Lyapunov optimization framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In a heterogeneous cellular network, a hierarchical FL framework can effectively enhance the number of devices participating in local learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In such a hierarchical FL framework, at each round, the network edge devices upload their model parameters only to the nearest F-APs (therein called small base-stations), and F-APs periodically upload the average local model parameters to the CS (therein called macro base-station) for a global aggregation. Thus, a large number of devices can participate in local learning. Besides, interference among the network edge devices can induce error in FL and increase the convergence time. Accordingly, interference aware radio resource allocation is also imperative for communication-efficient FL framework. A joint optimization of user selection, RRB allocation, and transmit power allocation was presented to minimize the loss function in FL training process. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed transmit power allocation of the IoT devices to enhance information freshness in FL system. Considering the presence of eavesdroppers in an Internet-of-drones network, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a secured and delay-constrained FL scheme through transmit power allocations.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Related works on energy-efficient FL:</span> Since the mobile devices are battery-driven, for a sustainable operation of an FL framework, it is imperative to reduce energy consumption of the edge devices. In particular, an energy-efficient or green FL should consider minimizing communication and computation energy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, energy-efficient radio resource allocation was proposed for delay constrained FL. However, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> only minimized the communication energy and ignored the computation energy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an adaptive FL framework, where the devices can send quantized or compressed model parameters and thus, save energy. However, the radio resource optimization was not presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, radio resource allocation was developed to minimize both communication and computation energy in an FL system subject to delay constraints. However, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> considered orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to connect edge devices with the base-station, which can limit the number of collaborating devices. Using OMA, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> also proposed joint transmit power and computation frequency allocation to reduce overall energy consumption of FL in a fog-aided IoT network. The energy limitation of the collaborating edge devices can also be improved by energy-harvesting technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> considered a game theory framework to motivate the network edge devices to participate in local learning while reducing its energy consumption.</p>

The considered architecture has a number of F-APs along with an CS, and the IoT devices are connected with the CS through F-APs. To improve the number of connected devices with F-APs using limited RRBs, an uplink non-OMA (NOMA) scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> is considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates efficient integration of joint cloud-fog computing and NOMA technique to reduce energy consumption of FL scheme. However, to take advantage of such an architecture for reducing energy consumption of FL, we need to develop a computationally efficient resource allocation scheme. Specifically, we need to address the following two challenges.</p>

The presented simulation results also interestingly reveal that for a large number of IoT devices and large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at the IoT devices instead of the F-APs.</p>

Thus, the vertex’ weight becomes small when the data transmission time from the represented IoT devices is small as well as the local computation time at the represented F-AP is small. This yields to a smart
scheduling of IoT devices representing the corresponding vertex with a smaller weight, which in turn minimizes
the energy consumption. Therefore, any minimal independent set in NOMA-coordinated graph represents a set of NOMA clusters that satisfies the following criterion: 1) each IoT device in the set is scheduled to only one F-AP and one RRB, 2) each RRB identified by the vertices
in a minimal independent set represents a NOMA cluster of two IoT devices, and 3) the total number of scheduled IoT devices at each F-AP is not larger than <math id="S5.SS2.p4.24.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="U" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p4.24.m3.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.p4.24.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p4.24.m3.1.1.cmml">U</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p4.24.m3.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p4.24.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p4.24.m3.1.1">𝑈</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p4.24.m3.1c">U</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

In Figs. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>-a and <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>-b, we plot the energy consumption versus the number of IoT devices for the first and second scenarios, respectively. Our proposed schemes have
the following two attributes. First, they judiciously schedule IoT devices
to F-APs/RRBs, adapt the transmission rate of each IoT device, and optimize the transmission power of each IoT device. Second, our proposed schemes efficiently optimize the computation frequency allocation of IoT devices and F-APs. Leveraging these two attributes, our proposed schemes significantly reduce the energy consumption compared to the benchmark schemes, as depicted from both Figs. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>-a and <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>-b.
In particular, the <span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">power-only</span> scheme selects the maximum computation frequency allocation for each IoT device and each F-AP. Consequently, the <span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">power-only</span> scheme results in higher energy consumption for local learning, and it increases the energy consumption of the system in both scenarios.
The <span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CPU-only</span> scheme ignores the power optimization that leads to more interference among the IoT devices and increased offloading transmission time. As a result, the <span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CPU-only</span> scheme leads to a high energy consumption. Finally, the <span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fixed</span> scheme has the most energy consumption
because it chooses the maximum CPU frequency and
transmission power. Accordingly, from an energy consumption perspective, it is inefficient to offload data to F-APs while ignoring the power allocation and employing random IoT device scheduling to F-APs/RRBs.</p>

First, it is clear that the FL time depends on the transmission time and the computation learning time of IoT devices. Since the local learning parameters have small size, the transmission
time for offloading such parameters to F-APs/CS requires smaller portion of the overall FL time compared with the computation training time. Consequently, the FL time is dominated by the computation training time. As can be seen from Figs. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, <a href="#S6.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, <a href="#S6.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, <span id="S6.SS2.p7.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fixed</span> scheme, that chooses the maximum CPU frequency, effectively minimizes the FL time at the cost of consuming the most energy as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> to Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI-B Simulation Results and Discussions ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Integrated Fog-Cloud Computing Enabled Internet-of-Things Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

does not change much with the number
of IoT devices and local parameter size. This is because the FL time
is mainly controlled by the longest local training time of one IoT device, which does not significantly change when the number of IoT device and the local parameter size are increased.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we provide some observations from our presented simulation results as follows. First, although the <span id="S6.SS2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fixed</span> scheme performs fairly well in terms of reducing the FL time, it exhibits a poor energy consumption performance, which is impractical. Thus, it
only serves as a benchmark scheme in this work. Second, it is advantageous to optimize the computation frequency allocation of the IoT devices and the F-APs as in the <span id="S6.SS2.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CPU-only</span> scheme. However, it is inefficient to ignore the power optimization that significantly impacts the energy consumption of the system. Third, the <span id="S6.SS2.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">power-only</span> scheme works well in terms if reducing the energy consumption; however, its performance is degraded since it uses the maximum CPU of each IoT and each F-AP. Fourth, our proposed schemes strike a balance
between the aforementioned aspects by judiciously scheduling IoT devices
to F-APs/RRBs, adapting the transmission rate of each IoT device, and optimizing the transmission power of each IoT device. Furthermore, our proposed schemes efficiently optimize the computation frequency allocation of IoT devices and F-APs. Finally, as the data size increases,
the energy consumption performance of the second proposed scheme degrades. This is because as the data size increases, the transmission time for offloading IoT devices’ data to F-APs is significantly increased. Thus, the energy efficiency of our proposed first scheme becomes more pronounced compared to our second proposed scheme.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the resource allocation strategy to minimize the energy consumption for performing FL in an integrated FCC-enabled IoT network subject to FL time constraint. Specifically, we considered two scenarios for training the local models, and for both scenarios, we proposed joint optimization
of computation frequency allocation, IoT device scheduling, and transmission power control of network edge devices. Leveraging graph theory, we proposed efficient iterative schemes. The presented numerical results revealed that the proposed schemes substantially reduce the energy consumption compared to the baseline solutions, at the cost of small increase of FL learning time. The presented simulation results interestingly revealed that for a large number of IoT devices and large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at the IoT devices instead of the F-APs.</p>
