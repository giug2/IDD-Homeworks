<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has been extensively studied and is the prevalent method for privacy-preserving distributed learning in edge devices. Correspondingly, continual learning is an emerging field targeted towards learning multiple tasks sequentially.
However, there is little attention towards additional challenges emerging when federated aggregation is performed in a continual learning system.
We identify <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client drift</span> as one of the key weaknesses that arises when vanilla federated averaging is applied in such a system, especially since each client can independently have different order of tasks.
We outline a framework for performing Federated Continual Learning (FCL) by using NetTailor as a candidate continual learning approach and show the extent of the problem of client drift. We show that adaptive federated optimization can reduce the adverse impact of client drift and showcase its effectiveness on CIFAR100, MiniImagenet, and Decathlon benchmarks. Further, we provide an empirical analysis highlighting the interplay between different hyperparameters such as client and server learning rates, the number of local training iterations, and communication rounds. Finally, we evaluate our framework on useful characteristics of federated learning systems such as scalability, robustness to the skewness in clients’ data distribution, and stragglers.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has drawn widespread attention to utilizing millions of edge devices that accumulate massive amounts of data while preserving data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Since these devices constantly generate enormous amounts of data, we need models that adapt to the trends in the new data.
Several studies have addressed this problem of learning on a sequential stream of data termed continual learning or lifelong learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
While both federated learning and continual learning have been widely studied independently in recent years, the effect of federated aggregation in a continual learning system, referred to as federated continual learning (FCL) has not been sufficiently explored despite its relevance to practical scenarios.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In an FCL system, the challenges are twofold. First, following the popular formulation of continual learning as a sequence of tasks, the challenge is to learn new tasks while avoiding the overwriting of previously learned tasks, commonly referred to as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Catastrophic Forgetting</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Second, similar to catastrophic forgetting between tasks in continual learning, federated learning handles heterogeneous data distributions from different clients resulting in a phenomenon called <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client drift</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1a</span></a>, when the data is heterogeneous, each of the clients pushes the model in a different direction in the optimization space and takes the model away from the true optima resulting in client drift.
Further, since there are multiple clients, the relative order of tasks in each client determines the overall client drift. We describe three practical cases with respect to the ordering of tasks. First, when all the clients contain the data for all the tasks simultaneously, defining the scenario of federated multi-task learning (FMTL) which has been explored previously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Second, the ideal case of federated continual learning where all the clients synchronously train on the same sequence of tasks. Finally, the case where each client independently trains on a different sequence of tasks. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1b</span></a> visually depicts the aforementioned order of tasks. Note that for simplicity we assume every client contains the dataset for all the tasks while in practice it is possible for some clients to not have some of the tasks.
Depending on the order of tasks, the system will have different trade-offs in terms of client drift and catastrophic forgetting. Intuitively, since the data from all the tasks are repeated across all clients over several rounds of training, the case of FMTL will have the best performance in terms of both client drift and catastrophic forgetting given a model with sufficient capacity. In the case of synchronous FCL, the problems of catastrophic forgetting and client drift are akin to that of standard continual learning and federated learning respectively. On the other hand, in asynchronous FCL the later rounds can overwrite the knowledge accumulated by the clients in the former rounds aggravating the problem of client drift.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on the problem of additional client drift in asynchronous FCL. We use a dynamic architecture approach based on NetTailor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> which has independent modules for each task thereby eliminating the problem of catastrophic forgetting and isolating the effect of client drift.
We show that using adaptive federated optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> can tackle this problem by showing its effectiveness by visualizing the client drift between models from consecutive rounds. We provide a comprehensive analysis of our system spanning different hyperparameters such as the number of communication rounds and learning rates. Further, we evaluate the performance with respect to challenges in a large-scale federated system such as scalability, data distribution, and stragglers.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The popular continual learning methods can be broadly classified into three categories — (1) Regularization approaches (2) Dynamic Architecture approaches (3) Memory Replay and Complementary Learning System approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Regularization-based approaches train a single model by using some form of regularization while learning new tasks so as to reduce the overwriting of the model parameters learned from the previous tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
Dynamic architecture approaches modify the network architecture according to the task either by adding additional modules or by using a subset of modules <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
Memory replay methods store a subset of the data from the previous tasks or synthesize using a generative model and use it to retrain along with the new tasks and avoid the drop in performance on previous tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Complementary learning systems
use different modules to learn and store generic long-term knowledge and task-specific short-term knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While regularization approaches are generally more efficient as they use a single model for all the tasks, training such methods across multiple clients in a federated learning paradigm involves significant interference both between tasks and data distribution in clients. On the other hand, since memory replay methods require storing a subset of past data to train the model on new tasks, it is not viable to retain data privacy while training such systems in a federated paradigm.
Although dynamic architecture approaches require additional memory as we add more modules to the model architecture for each new task, they offer flexibility in terms of adding more tasks to each client independently.
Moreover, the dynamic architecture approach decouples the orthogonal problems of catastrophic forgetting and client drift resulting in a simpler design.
NetTailor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> is one of the state-of-the-art continual learning methods based on the dynamic architecture approach which uses a common backbone network and adds additional lightweight task-specific branches resulting in a simple framework to implement continual learning without catastrophic forgetting. This provides a natural way of aggregating only the task-specific parameters to share knowledge between clients and hence is easily scalable to a large number of tasks. This further reduces the communication cost since only the gradients of task specific lightweight parameters are shared.
We use NetTailor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> as the candidate approach to show our findings. However, our framework can be extended to other continual learning methods as well.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Vanilla federated averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> suffers a performance drop when the data is not distributed in an independent and identical (non-IID) fashion among the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. There have been multiple works to improve federated averaging such as FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which uses a regularization term to stabilize federated training, and FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, which performs a layer-wise matching and averaging of the models to handle heterogeneous data. The authors of SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> use control variates to counter the effect of client drift and stabilize the training process. Further, the authors of Adaptive Federated Optimization (FedOpt) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> generalize the FedAvg and apply adaptive optimization algorithms such as ADAM and ADAGRAD in the federated aggregation process. This adaptive optimization makes the federated aggregation more smooth as a result provides an effective way to avoid client drift in federated continual learning systems.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> is the only work that attempts to address the problem of federated continual learning. FedWeIT uses weighted inter-client knowledge transfer to share constructive knowledge between clients having related tasks and avoid interference between clients having unrelated tasks. It achieves this by decomposing the network weights into global federated parameters and sparse task-specific parameters and the knowledge sharing is made selective by sharing a weighted combination of their task-specific parameters. We take an alternative approach of dynamic architecture with disjoint task-specific parameters thereby removing task interference altogether and at the same time reducing the overall communication cost. While FedWeIT provides a more efficient model with shared weights, our framework achieves higher accuracy since the interference between different task parameters is eliminated as well as effect of client drift is reduced with FEDADAM. We provide a comparison with FedWeIT on CIFAR100 dataset in section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Comparison to Previous Work ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>. Further, we provide experiments on the Decathlon benchmark which is a well-known benchmark for evaluating continual learning algorithms as compared to the simulated Non-IID 50 dataset used in FedWeIT. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of different hyperparameters and challenges of federated learning such as scalability, non-IID distribution, robustness to stragglers.</p>

of the branches that are used to enable or disable the branches. Since all the branches are not necessary for all tasks, this architecture is further pruned according to the complexity of tasks. The fact that NetTailor keeps the backbone network frozen and only updates the proxy branches aids in reducing the communication cost in federated learning since we only have to communicate the task-specific parameters and their gradients.</p>

Illustration representing our overall approach. The model in each client comprises a backbone network and a set of task-specific proxy layers for each task. The backbone network is pretrained using a large dataset like ImageNet hence contains the generic knowledge and is kept frozen. Each client independently trains only the task-specific blocks using the local data available. In every communication round, the gradients of the proxy layers are communicated to the server which aggregates these proxy layers and broadcasts them back to all the clients.

In both cases 2 and 3, we change the task at each client only after Q rounds. For instance, in the example shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1b</span></a>, the total rounds (R) is 16 and the number of tasks (T) is 4 resulting in Q = 4. Hence, the task is changed in all the clients after every 4 rounds.
In cases 2 and 3, we divide R rounds of federated training into T phases of Q rounds each. Then, we perform federated aggregation on the updates from all the clients with one task every Q rounds. This ensures that each client performs an equal amount of training in terms number of local epochs for all three cases resulting in a fair comparison.
Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 4 Federated Continual Learning Framework ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> provides a flow of the FCL for different task ordering.
We focus mainly on the case of shuffled task order without repetition depicting asynchronous FCL (Case 3) to perform extensive analysis and use cases 1 and 2 for comparison.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct extensive experiments spanning different aspects of federated learning as well as continual learning on three benchmark datasets — CIFAR100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, MiniImagenet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> and Decathlon Challenge for Continual Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. CIFAR100 is a standard benchmark dataset widely used in computer vision containing 50000 training images and 10000 test images with 32x32 pixel dimensions and 3 channels. We split the training data into 10 tasks of 10 classes each. MiniImagenet is a 100 class dataset sampled from the ImageNet data. The resolution of the images is reduced to 84x84. Similar to CIFAR100, we divide the miniImagenet into 10 tasks of 10 classes each. Decathlon benchmark is a collection of ten well-known datasets used to benchmark continual learning methods on visual domain. Each dataset in the collection is defined as a separate task.
Across all three datasets, the test set is held out and all the reported evaluation is performed on the entire test set.
We divide the datasets across the clients uniformly at random to obtain identically distributed data (IID) and use Dirichlet distribution to simulate non-IID scenarios. We use the IID case across our experiments to identify the effect of varying each parameter independently and study the impact of non-IID distribution in section <a href="#S5.SS4" title="5.4 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.4</span></a>.
We use standard ResNet18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> as the backbone model across all our experiments.

We examine the behavior of client drift in different ordering of tasks and show the extent of the problem in <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1 Client Drift in Different Order of Tasks ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>.
While we use all three datasets mentioned above for showing the effectiveness of our framework in section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Adaptive Optimizers and Client Drift ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>, we use CIFAR100 as the candidate dataset for comparing with related work in section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Comparison to Previous Work ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here we compare the different order of tasks described in section <a href="#S4" title="4 Federated Continual Learning Framework ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
We present the task-wise accuracy for all three cases on the CIFAR100 dataset in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3a</span></a>.
Since the updates from different clients is repeated in FMTL, the overwriting is avoided resulting in the highest performance among the three cases (i.e. baseline average accuracy of 82.79%).
In synchronous FCL, since all the clients are synchronously training on the same task, the client drift is at a minimum hence the accuracy is high.
However, in the case of asynchronous FCL, where the tasks are shuffled and there is no repetition, updates from the later rounds can overwrite the information learned from the clients in earlier rounds resulting in a significant performance drop.
We use cosine distance between the models following eq. <a href="#S3.E2" title="In 3.2 Client Drift ‣ 3 Preliminaries ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> to quantify and visualize client drift. We take the weights of the fully connected layers for each task as the proxy for the model and calculate the cosine distance between the models from consecutive rounds and plot for all three cases in Fig.<a href="#S5.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3b</span></a>. Note the spikes in cosine distance in the case of asynchronous FCL indicates that the clients in the later rounds overwrite the information learned from the earlier rounds highlighting the existence of the problem of aforementioned client drift in federated continual learning systems. In contrast, the case of FMTL shows significant deviation only during the initial stages of learning and becomes stable once the model is sufficiently trained. We show that using adaptive optimizers can reduce the impact of client drift and present our findings in the next section.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To further understand the impact of client drift and the effectiveness of using an adaptive optimizer we zoom in on the training progress of Task 1 on the CIFAR100 dataset across federated rounds in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Adaptive Optimizers and Client Drift ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a>. Note the sharp drops in accuracy at the boundaries of phases (at rounds 180 and 210) with FEDSGD which indicate that the updates from the current rounds are overwriting the model learned using the data from clients in the previous rounds.
We compare the cosine distances for FEDADAM with learning rates 0.5 and 0.1 to the baseline FEDSGD with a learning rate of 1.0.
FEDADAM avoids sudden jumps in the model updates by using the history of gradients to make the updates smooth. At the same time, if we use a lower learning rate, the updates themselves become small, hence, the convergence rate of the model is adversely affected.
We expand on this further by studying the behavior of the training method for different learning rates and the number of rounds in section <a href="#S5.SS4" title="5.4 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.4</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our aynchronous FCL results with FEDADAM training against previous work of FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> on CIFAR100 dataset in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.3 Comparison to Previous Work ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
Note that while the dataset partition is different since the reported accuracy is the average across all tasks for CIFAR100, the comparison is fair. Our method outperforms FedWeIT by a significant margin in terms of accuracy while having &lt;1% client drift. The improved performance can be attributed to the separate task parameters of the NetTailor architecture thereby eliminating the catastrophic forgetting due to interference between the tasks. Also, the FEDADAM optmization helps in reducing the overall client drift. Having separate parameters for each task aids in scaling our framework to more tasks as we can add an unlimited number of tasks without interfering with each other whereas it is uncertain how FedWeIT will scale to additional tasks. Additionally, we compare the model size and average communication cost per round for sharing the gradients from clients to server (C2S) and broadcasting the updated model to the clients (S2C) for a 5 client system trained on 10 tasks. While our model size is higher compared to FedWeIT, the communication cost per round is significantly lower since we are only communicating the gradients of the task-specific modules. This can be further reduced by applying gradient compression methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Number of rounds and local epochs:</span>  The number of local epochs and the total number of federated rounds are important factors in achieving convergence in federated learning systems. Here, we vary the number of local epochs from 1 to 5 for a different number of federated rounds ranging from 100 to 400. As summarized in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.4 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>a, we observe that having a large number of federated rounds reduces the accuracy as client drift accumulates over several rounds.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Server and client learning rates:</span> Here we vary both client and server learning rates and measure the final performance of the system (see Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.4 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>b). The learning rate at the client dictates how effectively the local models are being learned. This follows the trend of standard deep learning where using a lower learning rate will make the convergence slower but increasing the learning rate after some point makes the training unstable resulting in a diverging model. Therefore, we see an improvement in average accuracy as we increase the client learning rate up to 0.05 but the accuracy drops as we go to 0.1.  Similarly, decreasing the server learning rate makes the federated aggregation process smooth, resulting in improved performance both in terms of accuracy and client drift. However, reducing it further makes the updates extremely small resulting in slower convergence. Hence, for a fixed number of rounds, the final model has lower accuracy.</p>

Naturally, as the number of clients increases, there are more opportunities for newer clients to overwrite the learned model.

Hence, it is not always feasible to assume all the clients communicate their gradients in time to participate in the federated aggregation process. We measure the robustness of the system with respect to stragglers by varying the probability of the clients failing to communicate their gradients to the server. We progressively increase the probability of each client showing a straggler behavior (Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.4 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Addressing Client Drift in Federated Continual Learning with Adaptive Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>e). We observe that while the performance goes down it is still within less than a 2% drop from the baseline case, where, all the clients are guaranteed to communicate the updates. This shows the robustness of the system to stragglers.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present a framework for federated continual learning and identify client drift as the central challenge. We show that using adaptive federated optimizers can stabilize the federated aggregation and hence reduce the client drift. We provide a comprehensive analysis of different hyperparameters impacting the performance of the system.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limitations:</span> While we propose a framework to perform federated continual learning with reduced client drift, there are numerous unsolved challenges for achieving a scalable and robust federated continual learning system. For instance, while we reduce client drift with adaptive optimizers, the problem is not fully solved. We observe in our ablation studies that as we increase the number of rounds, the clients in the later rounds eventually overwrite the model thereby reducing the accuracy of the final model. Additionally, while NetTailor based approach removes catastrophic forgetting, the model size scales linearly with number of tasks making it impractical when we have large number of tasks. It is necessary to examine other continual learning methods that use a single model across all tasks such as Gradient Projection Memory (GPM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and Relevance Mapping Networks (RMN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. This will involve two orthogonal challenges of avoiding overwriting the model between tasks as well as between clients and additional scalability challenges which we leave for future work.</p>
