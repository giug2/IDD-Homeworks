<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">With the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), maintaining power grid stability has become a significant challenge. To address this issue, EV charging control strategies have been developed to manage the switch between vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) modes for EVs. In this context, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has proven its effectiveness in EV charging control. However, existing MADRL-based approaches fail to consider the natural power flow of EV charging/discharging in the distribution network and ignore driver privacy. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach that combines multi-EV charging/discharging with a radial distribution network (RDN) operating under optimal power flow (OPF) to distribute power flow in real time. A mathematical model is developed to describe the RDN load. The EV charging control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find an optimal charging control strategy that balances V2G profits, RDN load, and driver anxiety. To effectively learn the optimal EV charging control strategy, a federated deep reinforcement learning algorithm named FedSAC is further proposed. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of the diversity of the charging control strategy, the power fluctuations on RDN, the convergence efficiency, and the generalization ability.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuel-powered vehicles, with their potential to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Recent projections from the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicate that the EV market share has substantially increased in recent years and is predicted to reach approximately 30% by 2030 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, the increase in EVs also poses new challenges for the power grid, including burdening the electricity loads and amplifying the peak electricity demands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> demonstrated that even a 10% increase in EVs could result in significant fluctuations in the grid’s voltage curves.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) are considered effective techniques to minimize the negative impact of EV charging on the grid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
V2G involves discharging an EV back into the power grid, while G2V refers to charging an EV from the grid.
The V2G/G2V mode in a distribution network can help stabilize the power curve <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and provide peak shaving/valley filling services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
However, the uncertain factors, including dynamic electricity prices, grid load, and uncertainty in human behavior, increase the difficulty of generating a generalized charging policy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Consequently, the critical challenge lies in effectively coordinating EVs’ charging and discharging behavior in a dynamic environment to enable their active participation in electricity delivery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Numerous approaches have been proposed to develop optimal EV charging control policies. Traditional studies have formulated charging control as an optimization problem that aims to maximize the drivers’ profits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. For instance, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposes a two-stage charging optimization model to reduce the operation cost at the workplace. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the capacity limitation in distribution transformers is considered, and the continuous EV charging is formulated as linear programming. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> investigate energy trading in coordination with V2G and propose a solution using mixed-integer stochastic linear programming. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> designs a cost function with battery energy constraints, and the optimal EV charging control is computed through dynamic programming. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduces the uncertainty in wind energy supply and formulates the EV charging control as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> considers the customers’ dynamic preference for charging parameters and conducts a stochastic game to address the uncertainty. Reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> introduces time anxieties to address uncertain events and solves the EV charging problem using a generalized Nash equilibrium (NE) game.
In summary, all the algorithms mentioned above maintain an explicit optimization model under the assumption of a fully observable environment called model-based algorithms. The optimal charging control strategy is generated based on an accurate system model. However, fully observable environments rely on a priori knowledge about state transitions, and uncertain factors in the environment can interfere with state transitions, which further affects the model’s accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Model-free deep reinforcement algorithm (DRL) has demonstrated great potential in sequential decision-making problems without prior knowledge of the environment’s dynamics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. In DRL, the agent makes a decision for each state to obtain the reward sequence and then learns to optimize its policy to maximize expected future rewards. DRL algorithms have been widely adopted in grid management and have achieved excellent performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, including in EV charging control.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, discriminative features of electricity prices are extracted through a representation network, and Q-learning is developed to obtain the optimal discrete EV charging control strategy.
Reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> utilizes the long short-term memory (LSTM) method to extract the trend of electricity prices. The estimated electricity price is applied in a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for continuous EV charging control policy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the traffic conditions are considered to minimize the travel time and charging costs during charging navigation. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> formulates the EV charging control problem as a constrained MDP and develops a safe DRL method to learn the optimal scheduling strategy.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, the authors mathematically model the driver’s anxiety using statistical principles and propose using a soft actor-critic (SAC) to learn the optimal policy.
However, EV charging behaviors in the same system tend to affect each other, where such mutual influence is often ignored in single-agent DRL-based approaches.
Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms are more suitable for addressing EV charging control problems than single-agent ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. For example, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> promotes the type of tariff and develops a multi-agent multi-objective reinforcement learning framework to optimize the charging schedule. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, a multi-agent SAC-based framework is proposed to learn the environment’s dynamics, and its performance is verified in a simulated distribution network. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, the authors study the transformer constraints in a residential system and approximate the collective behaviors of EVs through a collective-policy model, using multi-agent SAC to learn the charging scheduling strategy.
Overall, model-free DRL-based methods have proven to be superior in addressing uncertainty in EV charging control.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the approaches mentioned above have two drawbacks. Firstly, while some advanced methods (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>) combine EV charging control with the distribution network and consider a systematic optimization process, they usually use simplified constraints as a substitute for complex power flow in the distribution network, which is insufficient and unreliable.
Moreover, the substitute electricity constraints are considered an optimization objective, which is often optional, leading to the possibility of irreversible damage to the distribution network during the EV charging control.
Secondly, the charging and travel data of each EV is privacy-sensitive, raising concerns about driver privacy when sharing massive data in MADRL.
To address this, some latest MADRL algorithms (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>) maintain a charging control strategy with individual charging experience to avoid privacy breaches. However, the isolated data of each EV limit the generalization of the strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the above issues, we propose an approach that leverages optimal power flow (OPF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> to model radial distribution networks (RDNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> for charging control policy training.
Specifically, we study a multi-EV charging and discharging system on an RDN, which operates under OPF and aims to allocate power flows to minimize power loss. Each EV is controlled by an agent that deploys a soft actor-critic (SAC) model inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. SAC has achieved excellent effects in continuous action space. It uses an entropy regularization method, which can effectively control the exploration and stability of the policy. Each agent receives regulation information from the RDN and executes local model training to maximize rewards, including V2G profits, grid idle degree, and driver satisfaction. The training process follows the FL mechanism, where agents upload their local model parameters to the server via a communication link. The server aggregates these parameters to refine a global model that enhances the generalization of the charging control strategy. As only model parameters are transferred during transmission, and local data is stored on each EV, drivers’ privacy is guaranteed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement Learning enables an agent to learn through interactions with the environment and make near-optimal sequential decisions. SAC is one of the off-policy Reinforcement Learning frameworks based on maximum entropy to address the poor stability of model-free DRL methods. SAC aims to learn a more diverse policy by balancing exploration and exploitation with entropy regularization, which prevents the agent from getting stuck in local optima.
The experimental results demonstrate that SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark tasks. Therefore, we adopt it in this paper to make optimal decisions in EV charging control.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The SAC mentioned above is shared among all agents, thus providing high autonomy for each EV’s charging control. However, the limited diversity of charging experiences within individual EVs can weaken the generalization performance of the agent. Moreover, due to the privacy-sensitive nature of charging/discharging behavior, sharing data among different EVs may pose a risk. To overcome these limitations, FL is proposed to train a highly generalized agent while preserving privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a distributed machine learning framework for exchanging intermediate parameters free of privacy disclosure during training. It consists of two participants: various data-owned clients and the central server. The clients update the parameters of the local model based on decentralized data and upload updates to a central server. The central server aggregates the parameters from the clients to update the global model. The server then broadcasts the updated global model to all clients and updates their parameters. This process is repeated multiple times until the model converges.</p>

Each EV calculates the individual rewards based on the global information from the RDN. After collecting enough rewards and states, such information will be used to update the parameters of SAC. The process is repeated enough times to generate a personalized charging policy for each EV. The EVs upload the updated parameters, and the server aggregates these parameters to generate a global model. The EVs download the global model to update the personalized charging policy. Training episodes repeat until the global model converges. Then a real-time charging control policy considering different driver behaviors is well-trained. As a standard federated learning framework, the FedSAC can train a highly generalized agent in a privacy-preserving manner.</span></p>

The ratio of three different kinds of EV drivers is 3:1:1. Each charging station sets a different price strategy to attract drivers, which means that each EV faces different electricity prices simultaneously. Despite the unit cost of electricity potentially varying among charging stations, they must still purchase electricity from the RDN. Therefore, the prices conform to the general trend of electricity prices within the grid. To simulate this situation, we randomly sample from [-10,10] and add it to the electricity price for every charging station at each timeslot. Additionally, we add a time offset of [-4, 4] to simulate any advance or delay in the electricity price trend.

The figure includes four kinds of reward curves: power reward, anxiety reward, grid reward, and sum reward. Each of them is the average of the reward curves of thirty EVs. The sum reward curve is the sum of the other three parts, which refer to (</span><a href="#S2.E17" title="In II-E4 Reward ‣ II-E Markov Decision Process Formulation ‣ II The Distribution Network Multi-EV G2V/V2G Model ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning for Electric Vehicles Charging Control on Distribution Networks" class="ltx_ref" style="color:#000000;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a><span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">). The shadowed regions represent the real training reward per episode, and the deep-colored curves illustrate smoothed episode reward curves. Although the natural average reward curves of the thirty agents exhibit significant fluctuations, the smoothed sum reward curves exhibit gradual growth and tend to stabilize eventually, indicating that our algorithm has learned a stable global policy. Since the FL mechanism averages the parameters of agents, the training reward would dramatically decrease during adjacent rounds, i.e., the reward curve drops at the 5000th, 10000th, etc, episode.</span></p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Specifically, the algorithm converges rapidly in the first round. After applying the FL mechanism, the reward curve drops briefly at the beginning of the second round. The power and anxiety rewards tend to be even with those of the first round, and the trend repeats throughout the training process. Overall, the power reward and anxiety reward curves are relatively stable during federated learning. Besides, the grid reward converges quickly in the first two rounds and falls into local optimal convergence at the end of 2nd round. However, with the help of the FL mechanism, the grid reward overcomes this and rises to a higher level in the subsequent rounds. The grid reward tends to be stable after about the 20000th episode. This phenomenon illustrates that the FL mechanism helps break through the limitations of a single EV dataset, thus improving the generalization of the algorithm. The grid reward is related to the other EVs in the RDN, in other words, globally relevant, while power reward and anxiety reward reflect the personalized requirement of each EV. Therefore, the federal mechanism has a more significant effect on improving the grid reward. During the training process, each reward curve shows an upward trend, indicating that our algorithm considers every optimization objective, and the weight coefficients set achieves a balance between several objectives. The sum reward situation is similar to that of grid rewards, and the final stable trend indicates that our proposed algorithm has learned a generalized global policy. In summary, the FL mechanism would not harm the convergence process and could help isolated agents escape from the local optimum caused by limited charging experience.</span></p>

The proposed method can reduce costs by employing dynamic electricity prices within the charging control process. In other words, the EVs can effectively regulate the sequential load distribution of RDN and further stabilize grid load under the charging decisions. Besides, when other EVs work in charging mode on RDN in a timeslot, the current EV would avoid charging along with them to prevent exorbitant instantaneous power. For instance, since electricity prices reach the first valley at approximately the 21st hour, three EVs opt to charge and reduce costs at this time. Considering the load pressure on the relevant distribution network, the EVs are charged in the order of EV1, EV2, and EV3. This result confirms that the proposed approach recommends dispersed charging in time from a global perspective. Likewise, node injection can potentially elevate the voltage at grid nodes. To counteract this, our algorithm regulates the decentralized discharging of EVs. The above phenomenon occurs because the grid reward effectively considers the current grid load.

The simulations confirm that the suggested algorithm enhances charging control policies, leading to lower charging expenses, reduced driver anxiety, and reduced RDN load. Moreover, this algorithm is suitable for all EVs.</span></p>

Under our policy, EVs prefer charging at times of low demand and discharging when demand is high, enabling them to play a novel role in electricity transactions. Under our assumption, the charging power of EVs is typically high, and simultaneous charging of all EVs could significantly augment the burden on the RDN, resulting in a rise in the load curve at the original valley and creating uncertainty in the power grid. Similarly, discharging also has the potential to introduce uncertainty, although the discharging power is typically lower than that of charging. Concentrated discharging can lead to an increase in node voltage, which further contributes to uncertainty. Such charging decisions would contravene the original purpose of V2G technologies.

The variance of power changes in the distribution network quantifies their degree of dispersion, where smaller power changes result in reduced uncertainty factors in the power grid. Specifically, the standard deviations of the SAC-MARL and SAC are 0.0919 and 0.5163, respectively. The SAC-MARL has reduced the standard deviation by 82.2%, compared to the SAC algorithm without the grid reward. These results indicate that the algorithm with our proposed grid reward provides a more stable power curve. Hence, the algorithm with our proposed grid reward can regulate the charging behavior of each EV to apply a stabler charging load on the power grid.</span></p>

All the algorithms achieve a well-converged state under the same number of training episodes. Our proposed FedSAC algorithm, which applies FL mechanisms, achieves the highest sum reward and is the best-performing algorithm. While the SAC-MARL algorithm also performs well, its limitation of isolated data makes its performance slightly inferior to that of FedSAC. However, the reward curve of FedSAC exhibits more volatility than SAC-MARL, demonstrating that FedSAC is slightly inferior in terms of stability. This is attributed to the non-uniformity and heterogeneity of data in distributed environments. TD3-MARL and DDPG-MADRL, which lack exploration of the environment, are far inferior to the SAC-based algorithms. Due to the optimization of the Q-function by the TD3 algorithm, its performance is still significantly better than that of DDPG-MARL.</span></p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">This paper proposes a federated deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the multi-EV charging control on an RDN. A smart OPF-based RDN is built first, which includes numerous isolated EVs connected to it, and an agent is used to manage EV charging control. A mathematical model is proposed to denote the RDN idle degree. The EV charging control problem is formulated as an MDP considering V2G profits, RDN idle degree, and driver’s anxiety. Firstly, the individual optimal charging control strategy of each EV is learned by SAC. Then the FL mechanism is introduced to generate a global model by aggregating the local parameters from each agent. The driver’s privacy is guaranteed during training. The case studies based on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed FedSAC can learn a stable cooperative charging control strategy and encourages decentralized EV charging, significantly reducing the load fluctuations on RDN. Besides, the comparisons clarify that the proposed algorithm performs better on convergence effect and generalization ability.</span></p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In this paper, the proposed FedSAC has slight shortcomings in terms of stability. Some potential methods such as weighted FedAVG and local training optimization can be tried to address such issues. Besides, the mobility of EVs is not considered because their stochastic nature makes it challenging to model. The future work will investigate the modeling approach to EV mobility and consider how to introduce it into EV charging control.</span></p>
