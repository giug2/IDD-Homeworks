<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p1.1">The past two decades have witnessed what is usually referred to as the Big Data revolution: the rapidly increase of collected data, the accelerating data storage and computing capacity and the breakthroughs in machine learning have given rise to entire new research areas in disparate scientific fields, collecting a series of astonishing results and solving some of the most challenging scientific problems formulated in the second half of the 20th century <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">hey2009the</span>]</cite>. While the major changes have mainly affected fields as biology and linguistics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Khurana2023</span>]</cite>, gastronomy, a field rarely touched by scientific enquiry, has sparked the interest of many scientists <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Ahnert2013</span>]</cite>, leading to the birth of computational gastronomy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">goel2022computational</span>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p2.1">Among many of the possible research questions, a preeminent aspect that interests researchers studying this new field, is understanding the reason behind food palatability (citation needed)(espandi spiegando cosa è la palatability).</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p3.1">This desire led to the emergence of hypotheses such as food pairing, a well-known gastronomical conjecture introduced by Chef Heston Blumenthal (citazione), positing that the compatibility of ingredients in recipes is largely determined by the number of shared flavor compounds they contain.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p4.1">A task of computational gastronomy is to provide evidence that supports or rejects these hypotheses. In this context, Ahn et al. were pioneers in using network methods to try to provide evidence in favor of food pairing, stating that it is verified only for North American cuisine, while the Asian one (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) behave the opposite.
This paved the way for subsequent studies, such as those by Jain et al. (citazione), who focused on Indian cuisine, Varshney et al. (citazione), who explored medieval cuisine, and Simas et al., who also investigated food bridging, a hypothesis that involves the idea that a third ingredient can serve as a bridge to enhance the compatibility between two other ingredients that do not share flavor compounds, thereby enriching the gastronomical experience.
<br class="ltx_break"/></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p5.1">Validating or negating these hypothesis is key to understanding the mechanism behind the formation of recipes and the perception of taste.
The addition or replacement of ingredients in recipes is an increasingly popular demand that, in recent years, has intertwined with more compelling problems. Being able to replace ingredients in recipes could on one hand allow to make food more sustainable by responding to environmental issues, and on the other hand meet health needs, such as improving nutrient content of food or adapting recipes to food intolerance. 
<br class="ltx_break"/>In recent years, fueled by vast amount of collected data and recently developed data-mining methods,
recommender systems have been used to tackle these pressing demands, leading to the development of food recommendation, a field that has rapidly come to be a research area of its own. 
<br class="ltx_break"/></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p6.1">Our work starts by observing that food pairing hypothesis can be naturally associated to item-item collaborative filtering, a particular kind of recommender system (citation needed) that, starting from a bipartite network that connects item to users according to their preferences, works by recommending an item I to user U if U is connected to items similar to I. In food recommendation, recipes can be regarded as users and ingredients as items: an ingredient I is recommended to recipe R if R contains ingredients that are very similar to I. In this context, food pairing postulates that the similarity between pairs of ingredients is positively correlated to the number of flavor compounds they have in common.
<br class="ltx_break"/></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p7.1">Leveraging on this, starting from the same recipe data used in the work of Ahn et al. (citation needed), we compare different recommenders using ingredient-ingredient similarity based on flavor compounds. We contrast these findings with a system that bases its recommendations on recipe co-occurrence data. Our analysis reveals that the recipe-based approach generally surpasses the flavor-based system in terms of accuracy for ingredient recommendations, underscoring the limited role of food pairing in recipe creation. Notably, the flavor-based recommender system demonstrates efficacy primarily within North American culinary contexts, corroborating Ahn et al.’s conclusions regarding the regional specificity of food pairing. Further scrutiny into the nature of ingredient compatibility highlighted that the apparent success of food pairing often results from simplistic matches between highly similar ingredients (for example, ’bell pepper’ and ’green bell pepper’) which share identical flavor profiles. This observation prompts a reevaluation of the underlying mechanisms attributed to food pairing in culinary science.
<br class="ltx_break"/></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p8">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p8.1">Lastly, within the recipe-based case, we compared the conventional similarity-based systems with LightGCN, a graph convolutional network. As previously observed in the literature (citation needed), LightGCN tends to yield more accurate recommendations. However, this increase in accuracy comes at the cost of reduced interpretability due to the opaque, ’black box’ nature of machine learning algorithms.</p>
