<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Mobile sensing appears as a promising solution for health inference problem (e.g., influenza-like symptom recognition) by leveraging diverse smart sensors to capture fine-grained information about human behaviors and ambient contexts. Centralized training of machine learning models can place mobile users’ sensitive information under privacy risks due to data breach and misexploitation. Federated Learning (FL) enables mobile devices to collaboratively learn global models without the exposure of local private data. However, there are challenges of on-device FL deployment using mobile sensing: 1) long-term and continuously collected mobile sensing data may exhibit domain shifts as sensing objects (e.g. humans) have varying behaviors as a result of internal and/or external stimulus; 2) model retraining using all available data may increase computation and memory burden; and 3) the sparsity of annotated crowd-sourced data causes supervised FL to lack robustness. In this work, we propose FedMobile, an incremental semi-supervised federated learning algorithm, to train models semi-supervisedly and incrementally in a decentralized online fashion. We evaluate FedMobile using a real-world mobile sensing dataset for influenza-like symptom recognition. Our empirical results show that FedMobile-trained models achieve the best results in comparison to the selected baseline methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Mobile devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, and other wearable devices are equipped with a rich set of sensors that can collect human behavioral and physiological data continuously and unobtrusively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Data collected by using embedded sensors (e.g., accelerometer, GPS, and Bluetooth sensors) in mobile devices have been leveraged in plethora healthcare-related fields including but are not limited to physical state inference, mental health monitoring, and mobile interventions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, wide adoption of mobile sensing applications, especially for health inference problems such as influenza-like symptom recognition, remains challenging due to three major concerns: 1) privacy issues, 2) long-term streaming data, and 3) sparse labeled data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For privacy concerns, where the data are stored, who has access to them, and how they are used are among the typical aspects of users’ concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. For example, GPS trajectories can reveal mobile users’ whereabouts, which can then be exploited to further infer sensitive personal information such as race, gender, physical activities, social relationship, and health status. A second example involves adopting Bluetooth devices for contact tracing, as users who contract contagious viruses are generally required to release all their personal information. Other users may also have concerns about being tracked of their social relationships, as they may not know how their contact data might be used beyond monitoring infectious disease.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A privacy-preserving method is needed to address these privacy concerns in mobile sensing applications. Privacy preservation is both a legal and technical problem, and cannot be simply absolved by a voluntary consent form from users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Appropriate technical and organizational measures are required through a proper engineering process. Many privacy-preserving approaches and algorithms have been proposed according to different application scenarios.
For instance, k-anonymity algorithm and its variants have been proposed to hide identities in the source of data items <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Differential privacy aims to reduce exposure of authentic information by adding perturbations that follow certain noise distribution while maintain data utility.
However, anonymization techniques could make sensitive attributes vulnerable to inference attacks; and differential privacy could downgrade data utility and lower the power of learned models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, whereas model utilities are critical in mobile health applications.
Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning mechanism in which users can collaboratively contribute knowledge to the global learning target without transmitting data samples to a central server, or sharing them among users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In mobile sensing applications using FL, mobile devices hold their own datasets and use them to train local models, reducing the chance of data and privacy breach; a central server then trains a global model by learning from local weights or gradients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For the long-term streaming data problem, data collection of these applications is often a prolonged process. Take influenza-like symptom recognition as an example, only long-term monitoring can be meaningful and effective, as influenza symptoms usually exist for few days, while people will stay in good health for the majority of time. Short term monitoring cannot guarantee capturing participants’ symptoms and their associated behavior changes when they are unwell.
Meanwhile, if we retrain models using all existing data, the computation and memory burden would be high and prohibitive for mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. If we retrain models using only the newly incoming data, a classic problem referred to as catastrophic forgetting will significantly downgrade model performance.
Incremental learning is designed for models built on streaming data to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> by continuously updating the models with knowledge transfer. It also helps the model continuously monitor users’ health states, while adapt to computation and memory constraints in mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, for the sparse labeled data problem, data annotations are often carried out by the users in mobile sensing applications. These tasks add significant burdens on participants and result in low compliance rate and high attrition rate. To mitigate user burdens, annotation tasks would be limited, leading to sparse labeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Thus the robustness of the learned models built on datasets with limited and sparse labels cannot be guaranteed.
A semi-supervised method could be incorporated to enhance the data with limited labels to ensure the utility and robustness of the learnt models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Combining the aforementioned solutions for a privacy preserving mobile sensing framework, we employ graph neural network as the basic model as they have been proved to be capable of capturing hierarchical spatial and temporal relationships in human behavior dynamics (i.e., people’s activities can vary over time and locations) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
We propose an incremental semi-supervised federated learning approach, FedMobile, in an attempt to address the above challenges.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As more and more fine-grained personal data are being collected and applied in different health inference tasks, privacy protection has become an essential demand by the data owners, and federated learning as a general framework can fulfill a large degree of this demand by keeping individual data local while allowing development of artificial intelligence models in a distributed manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Localizing personal data allows data owners to have full control over how their data can be accessed and used, reduces risks of unintended data exposures, and makes possible collaborative developments of machine learning models that require large scale training data.
It is also not in direct conflicts with many other privacy-preserving techniques such as homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, thus can be combined with them to further enhance privacy preservation.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Ever since its first proposal by a few Google engineers in an application to Android device keyboard stroke prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, federated learning has been widely researched and applied in many fields (e.g., natural language processing (NLP), internet of things (IoT). Among all these researches in FL, of special interests to us are works that fall in mobile edge computing, health related inferences, and the intersection between them.
Empowered by 5G network, as we move towards the internet-of-things era, applications of FL in mobile edge computing are increasingly commonplace.
Bonawitz et al. proposed a scalable production system for federated learning on Android mobile devices, of which the system design is not limited to the Android operating system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
Lim et al. disscussed different aspects of implementing federated learning in a mobile edge network, pointing out various implementation challenges in FL such as security attacks, computation resources constraints, and particularly the unlabeled data issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Albaseer et al. built a FedSemL system on the network edge with considerations in limited resources, deadline constraints, a scarcity of labeled data and an abundance of unlabeled data samples in edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the problem of lack of labels in clients, semi-supervised learning is integrated to the FL framework to leverage the large amount of unlabeled data.
Zhong et al. proposed a semi-supervised federated learning method for heterogeneous devices, which adopts pseudo-labeling method as its semi-supervised learning strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Specifically, it assumes that the central server has a small amount of labeled data to train an initial global model, which is then used to obtain pseudo-labels for local unlabeled samples that meet certain entropy conditions (i.e., below a selected entropy threshold).
Presotto et al. proposed SS-FedCLAR, a FL framework that combines Federated Clustering and Semi-Supervised Learning to mitigate both the non-IID and data scarcity problems for Personalized Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Specifically for semi-supervised learning, active learning and label propagation were combined to train local models without labeled data in clients.
Zhao et al. proposed a multimodal and semi-supervised
federated learning framework that trains auto-encoders to extract
shared or correlated representations from different local data
modalities on clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. First the server utilizes central data in different modalities to train a multimodal auto-encoder (e.g., deep canonically correlated auto-encoders); then the global auto-encoder is shared among clients with different data modality orientations for further updates; these local updates on the auto-encoders will then be aggregated in the server and used to encode an auxiliary multimodal labeled dataset, from which a classifier will be built and used by all clients. In this fashion, the traditional FL problem is converted into an auto-encoder based FL problem that can accommodate heterogeneous data modalities in clients.
Yang et al. proposed Federated Incremental Learning (FedIL), a novel and general framework that employs a siamese network for contrastive learning to ensure acquiring high quality pseudo-labels during training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
Compared with these works, our current work adopts consistency regularization for semi-supervised learning, enabling the use of large amount of unlabeled data in clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the lack of data labels in clients, most realistic FL applications are also inherently incremental. As new data are generated in client devices, they are fed to local training rounds to obtain local model updates that will be aggregated by the central server for the global model updates. The new data used in this process could contain unseen new classes or shifts in domain (i.e., changes in the underlying distribution for the data due to user behavior changes), dramatically downgrading the performance in the original model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. This so called catastrophic forgetting phenomenon needs to be addressed when implementing FL applications.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an online traffic classification model called Fed-SOINN, which adopted a self-organizing incremental neural network in a hierarchical federated learning framework. Their online incremental learning component is dedicated to solve the unseen new network traffic classes in the online traffic classification problem.
Likewise, Dong et al. proposed a new model called Global-Local Forgetting Compensation (GLFC) to tackle the federated class-incremental learning problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
Yang et al. applied KL loss to enforce the consistency between the predictions made by clients and the server during client training, while screened the uploaded client weights by cosine similarity with normalization to accelerate the convergence of model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
Castellon et al. proposed to address the domain shift challenge by clustering clients into groups with similar data distributions, effectively creating global models for each cluster of clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
In comparison, our proposed approach leverages the advantages of incremental learning (IL) to federally update model weights in streaming data by continuously transferring previous learned knowledge from previously trained models to new models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Consistency regularization (CR) is a widely-used technique for semi-supervised and self-supervised learning, aiming to improve the generalizability of a trained model by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. The core idea of CR is to penalize the models that are sensitive to perturbed inputs under the assumption that the label semantics are not affected by perturbations. In FL setting, especially in practice with non-IID data, FL algorithm can encounter a weight divergence problem as the global model goes through increasing rounds of communications. To utilize the large amount of unlabeled data, we use CR as regularizer by comparing model outputs of original unlabeled data and unlabeled data with perturbations. Here we assume that, for each round of communications, the mini batches of unlabeled data within each client remain consistent for small perturbations. We introduce a new loss component, Kullback–Leibler divergence, <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="KL(\bullet||\bullet)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">K</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2">L</mi><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.3"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.3.1">(</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.3.2">∙</mo><mo fence="false" rspace="0.167em" stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.3.3">|</mo><mo fence="false" stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.3.4">|</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.3.5">∙</mo><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.3.6">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">KL(\bullet||\bullet)</annotation></semantics></math>, to calculate the divergence between the prediction output distributions of the unlabel data and the unlabel data with perturbations.

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In general, knowledge distillation (KD) consists of two components, training expert model and training apprentice model. The expert model refers to a model trained by using historical data from domain population or a pre-trained model. In the distillation process for training apprentice model, knowledge learned by the expert model is transferred to the apprentice model by minimizing the distance of the prediction distributions between them given the same inputs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. In the continual model learning process, KD allows the trained apprentice model to update its parameters by using the newly collected data, therefore historical data can be removed to alleviate memory burden in devices. Additionally, in the long run of mobile sensing data collection, the sensing objects can change their behaviors because of internal and/or external stimuli. Dong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, for example, observe that during COVID-19, people become more sedentary and spend more time at home due to infection risk reduction and public intervention. Therefore, the collected data can come from varying domains, causing domain shift problems that downgrade the generalizability of previously trained models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. KD enables the apprentice model to adapt to the newly collected data and overcome knowledge forgetting.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Handcrafted feature engineering has been widely investigated in machine learning studies of mobile sensing. Despite fine-grained featurization of raw mobile sensing data and sufficient interpretability, complex interactions and high-level interdependence within human state variations can be underrepresented in manually extracted features. In addition, there exists structural topology in non-euclidean domains of raw mobile sensing data (e.g., GPS, Bluetooth Encounter), it can be challenging for handcrafted feature engineering to capture such topological information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. There are numerous study have been finished in investigating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for sensor data, and demonstrated advanced performance in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. We hypothesize that people who are in early stage of influenza will subconsciously become less active, and avoid unnecessary traveling and person-to-person interactions. We leverage multiple embedded sensors to capture human behavior information: GPS sensors are used to capture human mobility behaviors; Bluetooth encounters are used as proximity to measure social behaviors; accelerometer and gyroscope can monitor physical activeness; web-virtual behaviors are tracked by recording app usages; and ambient contexts can be inferred by WiFi signals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In graph construction process as shown in <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.4 Graph Modeling in Mobile Sensing ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ Incremental Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Health Inference via Mobile Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, for mobility behavior, given a sequence of cluster labels generated from clustering of GPS coordinates that record people’s daily traveling trajectory, we treat each cluster label as a node and add edges between every pair of consecutive visited places (clusters). For the other behaviors and surrounding environments, we first partition the multi-modal sequential discrete sensor signals into several sub-sequences, where each sub-sequence represents the behaviors or contexts at the corresponding location people visit. For example, for accelerometer and gyroscope, we represent each recognized human activity as a node in graphs, and add edges between every two sequential activity states in the table. And then we apply this graph construction mechanism for each cluster partition to generate a sequence of graphs. Each sample in the input of GNNs consists of a static graph that encodes mobility behavior and multi-channel dynamic graphs that capture social, activity, web-virtual behaviors and ambient environments. Finally, we use the engineered graph structured data for early detection of influenza-like symptoms.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our proposed FedMobile by using real-world collected mobile sensing data that were collected to monitor warfighters’ health status continuously. This mobile sensing study originates from a DARPA-funded project using smartphones for healthcare analysis, investigating passively collected mobile sensing data for earlier infectious disease diagnosis. The study protocol was approved by the University of Virginia IRB (IRB #20770). Overall, 2,600 participants from 24 states in the U.S. signed informed consents and were recruited to participate in the data collection. The total length of this study was one year. A rich set of sensor data was collected, including GPS, Bluetooth encounter, Wifi signal, app usage, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc. We asked participants to install and run a mobile sensing app called ReadiSens. At 8 pm daily, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) were delivered to collect self-reported influenza symptoms, including fever, cough, difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, and diarrhea. We have the data from around 800 participants for this study. Active data collection was conducted on a rolling basis from February 15th, 2019 to April 30th, 2020. The total number of annotated and unannotated daily observations was around 6,100 (18% were reported as having influenza symptoms) and 22,000, respectively.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the centralized training process and baseline Federated Learning methods, we divide the labeled data set into 70%, 20%, and 10% subsets for training, validation, and testing, respectively. We adapt semi-supervised learning for the centralized training process. In the incremental FL training process, we simulate the mobile sensing streaming data and conduct FedMobile using the data in their chronological order. The first 40% training data are used to conduct step 1 of FedMobile to produce an expert model by 40 rounds of communications as described in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Step 1: training an expert model decentralizedly using consistency regularized local update. ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ Incremental Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Health Inference via Mobile Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>. In the step 2 of FedMobile, as described in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Step 2: training apprentice model and continual model learning using incremental local update. ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ Incremental Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Health Inference via Mobile Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>, we set the number of incremental updates as 8 in this experiment, where the simulated streaming data were partitioned into 8 batches by their chronological order for the incremental training. The overall training process of FedMobile for streaming mobile sensing data is shown in Fig <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 Step 1: training an expert model decentralizedly using consistency regularized local update. ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ Incremental Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Health Inference via Mobile Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. And we set the number of rounds of communications as 10 for each batch of mobile sensing data empirically. Without considering the privacy issue, we train the models by a central server using Adam to investigate whether federated (privacy protected) methods can achieve comparable results with the centralized method. In the modeling of mobile sensing data for influenza-like symptom recognition, by leveraging graph representation of human behaviors as demonstrated in this related works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, we transform raw mobile sensing data to graph structured data to extract high-level human behavioral features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. We use Graph Convolutional Network (CCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, Graph Attention Network (GAT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> and GCN-LSTM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> to fit the graph structured data, and use Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> to fit handcrafted features. We add Gaussian noise to the handcrafted features and randomly add/remove edges of graphs as the stochastic functions in consistency regularization for the semi-supervised FL. We set the default parameters across all models as batch size = 256, all embedding size = 128, and layer number=2. We train the models for 150 epochs. We optimize all models with AdamW optimizer. Xavier initialization is used to initialize the parameters. Learning rate is searched in [1e-6, 1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3], and L2 normalization coefficient is tuned in [1e-7, 1e-6, 1e-5, 1e-4] using 30% randomly sampled training dataset for all models.</p>

We observe that the models trained by using FedMobile have comparable results to the centralized models. As centralized training provides the best results without considering privacy issue, our proposed FedMobile shows equivalent prediction results, which indicates that our approach could achieve privacy preservation at the data level without compromising its prediction performance. FedMobile-trained models outperform the models trained by using the other FL baselines. As shown in Fig <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Baselines and Evaluation Metrics ‣ 4 Data Collection and Experiment ‣ Incremental Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Health Inference via Mobile Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we observe that, generally, in the training of expert model, FedMobile shows a similar training trajectory with FedMatch-FT or FLwF at the begining and then surpasses the training trajectories of other baseline models; in the second step, FedMobile shows an continuously increasing F1-Score, which implies that FedMobile enables the trained model to gain incremental knowledge from both labeled and unlabeled data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The superior performance of FedMobile can be attributed to several components in the design of the incremental federated learning architecture. Firstly, the property of knowledge distillation (KD) imposes penalty for new knowledge to mitigate overfitting, and can adapt to the new knowledge after several iterations of incremental learning. Secondly, consistency regularization in FedMobile utilizes massive amount of unannotated samples to increase the robustness of GNNs by penalizing substantial changes of inferred label semantics between communication rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>. Additionally, CR also reduces the divergence of the local weight updates among distributed clients to stabilize the global model parameter optimization.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work has practical implications in privacy preserving machine learning for mobile health. First, FedMobile shows a promising solution for on-device deployment of Federated Learning to mitigate the memory scarcity issue in mobile devices. Additionally, the evaluation results imply that FedMobile can be used for privacy preserving individual level health monitoring and inference without compromising the predictive power of neural network models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, at present, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies on collaborative efforts from local clinics to state agencies to report influenza virus infection cases. However this case report system can be unpunctual and prone to underestimate. The limitations of traditional public health reporting and syndrome surveillance can be overcome by deploying our proposed mobile sensing solution in practice. Last but not least, interventions can be delivered to change individual’s behavior (e.g., self-isolation) if influenza-like symptoms are detected. The interventions can be scaled up to a population level to combat the transmission of influenza virus.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are also several limitations in this work. First of all, although the mobile sensing data are collected in the wild, the experiments are conducted using simulations in an incremental learning setting using aggregated data from each client. In a real world situation, an individual user could be treated as a client, and data from each client can have heterogeneous distributions causing weight divergence problem, which may not have been appropriately addressed in our current proposed method. Secondly, in this study, we assume that the clients update their local models synchronously. However, in real world situation, each individual mobile device has different computational power and network access, making synchronous federated learning challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, we will deploy FedMobile on smartphones and develop a digital platform for decentralized human health monitoring. Furthermore, to achieve individual level health monitoring, it is critical to develop robust Federated Learning algorithm that can work on non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data with stationary global update. And we plan to enlarge the existing sensor network to include audio data, physiological data (i.e., heart rate), text messages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. Moreover, personalized FL for lifelong learning is another direction that is worth investigating.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduce FedMobile, an incremental semi-supervised Federated Learning framework for influenza-like symptom recognition using mobile sensing. FedMobile has demonstrated its potentials to train neural network models using continuously collected streaming data. It integrates Knowledge Distillation and Consistency Regularization, such that FL models can be updated in an online fashion to relieve computation and memory burden, and large amount of unlabeled data can be utilized to mitigate within-client inconsistency. The experiments we conducted using a real-world mobile sensing data generated from 800 participants demonstrate that FedMobile can recognize the existence of influenza-like symptoms in a privacy protected way without compromising the trained models’ predictive capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>.</p>
