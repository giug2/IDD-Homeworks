<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Source Inference Attack (SIA) in Federated Learning (FL) aims to identify which client used a target data point for local model training. It allows the central server to audit clients’ data usage. In cross-silo FL, a client (silo) collects data from multiple subjects (e.g., individuals, writers, or devices), posing a risk of subject information leakage. Subject Membership Inference Attack (SMIA) targets this scenario and attempts to infer whether any client utilizes data points from a target subject in cross-silo FL. However, existing results on SMIA are limited and based on strong assumptions on the attack scenario. Therefore, we propose a Subject-Level Source Inference Attack (SLSIA) by removing critical constraints that only one client can use a target data point in SIA and imprecise detection of clients utilizing target subject data in SMIA. The attacker, positioned on the server side, controls a target data source and aims to detect all clients using data points from the target subject. Our strategy leverages a binary attack classifier to predict whether the embeddings returned by a local model on test data from the target subject include unique patterns that indicate a client trains the model with data from that subject. To achieve this, the attacker locally pre-trains models using data derived from the target subject and then leverages them to build a training set for the binary attack classifier. Our SLSIA significantly outperforms previous methods on three datasets. Specifically, SLSIA achieves a maximum average accuracy of 0.88 over 50 target subjects. Analyzing embedding distribution and input feature distance shows that datasets with sparse subjects are more susceptible to our attack. Finally, we propose to defend our SLSIA using item-level and subject-level differential privacy mechanisms. The attack accuracy decreases by 36% with a utility loss of 20%, using a subject-level differential privacy budget of 22.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Even though Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> avoids the transition of private data across clients (federation users) to collaboratively train a global model, it is still under the threat of security and privacy attacks. For example, the gradient leakage attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> recovers training data information or labels of the local models exploiting the shared gradients, the reconstruction attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> usually trains a GAN to reconstruct the data belonging to a specific label or local client, and, finally, the property inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> aims to expose the property of the whole training data. The large number of attacks identified by the recent research community indicates that the basic strategy of training local models separately in FL is not enough to protect private data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the introduction of regulations like GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and CCPA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, people and governments are paying more attention to auditing privacy data usage. In FL, the Source Inference Attack (SIA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and Subject Membership Inference Attack (SMIA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> are two recently proposed attack methods, which can also be considered suitable tools to audit data usage. SIA detects which client trains its local model with a target data point. SMIA checks whether any client (or a specific set of clients) utilizes the data from a target subject for training. However, an honest but curious central server may care more about detecting all the local clients (none, one, or more than one) that train their models with data from the target subject without having access to the specific target dataset used. However, to our best knowledge, there is no such practical and efficient method. Therefore, we propose a novel Subject-Level Source Inference Attack (SLSIA) to achieve this goal.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our SLSIA distinguishes itself from existing inference attacks, although it shares some similarities with the property inference attack. However, a property inference attack tries to infer the existence or distribution of sensitive property (e.g., voice accent, skin color, income, doctor specialty, product type, and age) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> in the training data of the target model. By contrast, our SLSIA focuses on detecting whether a target local model uses data generated by a subject. The data points belonging to a specific subject are usually not equal to the data points sharing the same property, which distinguishes the property inference and our attack. Besides, our final purpose is to find all the clients using the data from a target subject in a cross-silo FL while holding another set of data points from the subject. In addition, the previous SMIA either can not precisely find which clients train their local models with the data from the target subject <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> or have strong assumptions (such as, they require that considered clients have a local dataset with 10% data of all subjects, or they interrupt the training of FL, and so forth) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The DMIA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> aims to distinguish two datasets that differ only in the contribution of a specific subject, and the remaining data are from the same subjects. However, the local clients holding data from the target subject can still have data from other non-overlapping subjects in cross-silo FL. Hence, different from the DMIA scenario, in the attack scenario we consider, the clients to identify are those having data from the target subject in their local dataset. Still, we cannot assume that the remaining part of the data somehow overlaps.
As a final remark, we outline that in the scenario considered by the standard instance-level MIAs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, the member data point is in the training data of one target model. Therefore, the data point is known, and the attack aims to verify whether the target model uses it. Instead, we consider a situation in which some FL clients may use data points (an arbitrary set) from a target source.
The attacker, located on the server side, does not have access to the specific set of data possibly used by such clients but, instead, has access to other data samples from the same target source.
This complex attack scenario makes our solution novel and more advanced concerning existing related works in this context.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To develop our solution, we analyze recent findings proposed by Song et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. The authors suggest that the model’s intermediate outputs expose the private information of its training data. In particular, the representation of the last layer in the feature extractor overlearns and reveals sensitive attributes of the input data. Following this reasoning, in our solution, we utilize the intermediate embeddings of the local model on a set of data points from the target subject to predict whether the tested model (a local model from one of the clients) has been trained with data from the target subject. The ablation study we carried out and reported in Section  <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.4 Ablation Study ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows that the early output of layers is a key factor in developing our attack.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our SLSIA pipeline consists of three steps.
First, the attacker uses data from the target source to pre-train two types of support models: the former exploiting data from the source and the latter exploiting only data from other sources. Once trained, the embeddings produced by these two model types for input data produced by the target source are used to build a binary attack classifier. After that, the binary attack classifier is used to evaluate local models during the first round of FL. The main reason for selecting the first round is that local models trained without the data from the target subject will also learn about the subject as the FL aggregation is executed after each training step, ultimately disturbing the source inference.
Therefore, during the first round of FL, the central server obtains the embeddings produced by each local model for the same evaluation set of data points from the target subject. Such embedding is then used as input to our binary attack classifier to identify all the clients trained with the data from the target subject.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we present in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Background ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, SIA predicts the only target client as the one with the smallest loss on the target data point. SMIA compares the losses of data points from the target subject with a threshold or accumulates those losses among the training epochs to observe the number of decreases of the summed loss. We can not directly apply previous approaches to our scenario, in which there can be more than one or no target client, the total number of them is unknown to the server, and the final purpose is to detect all target clients. We explain two transferred methods from previous works in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Attack Performance ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a> for comparison. The target model means the local model trained with one target data point (SIA), the global model trained with the data from a target subject (SMIA), or the local model trained with the data from a target subject (our SLSIA).</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Following the work of Suri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, we select FEMNIST and Shakespeare datasets with a clear concept of the subject for the attack. The FEMNIST is a federated extended MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> that not only contains classes characterized by handwritten digits and letters but also includes information on writers who contributed to the collection of data points. This additional writer information makes the dataset perfectly fit our scenario, in which we consider each writer a subject. Here, we only use the digits following the MNIST, which only contains the digits. Besides, we can reduce the impact of the internal difference of the dataset caused by combining the digits and letters to the classification and the attack.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As the second dataset, we selected the Shakespeare dataset from the LEAF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> family, a repository that provides different federated benchmark datasets.
The Shakespeare dataset contains dialogues of characters in the classic William Shakespeare plays, and the characters can be considered different subjects.
In this case, the main task of FL is the next-word prediction.
We opted for this task due to the limitations of alternatives applicable to this dataset in our subject-centric scenario, like the next-character task, as highlighted by other works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
Besides, we excluded characters with less than 400 words to guarantee the data points for each character and eliminate the impact of data inadequacy while being selected as the target subject of the attack. Each data point in the Shakespeare dataset is a continuous sequence of 32 words with a label of the next word. Finally, we obtain data on 404 characters in the Shakespeare dataset.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.5" class="ltx_p">Apart from those two already existing datasets, we also construct a Synthetic dataset following the guide of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. We model each subject as a random (and valid) mean and covariance matrix in a multivariate Gaussian distribution to obtain well-separated and characterized subjects.  In particular, we enforce a minimum pair-wise (L2 <math id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&gt;" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><gt id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1"></gt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">&gt;</annotation></semantics></math> 0.35) separation between all subject distributions’ means to avoid overlap.

In the work of Hu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, they utilize the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to measure the performance of the SIA on an evaluation group of target data points. They define the ASR as the fraction of the target data points whose source status is correctly identified by the server in the evaluation group. Their ASR is similar to the recall, which is the percentage of correctly predicted positive instances among all the actual positive instances. To measure the performance of our SLSIA, we define metrics from the perspective of each target subject.

Comparing the ground-truth source list with the potential source list predicted by our attack, we calculate each target subject’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1.
Then, distinct metrics of target subjects are averaged to produce the performance of our attack, and we compare it with previous methods.
When we compare the ground-truth source list and the potential source list by calculating the accuracy in the classification task, the number of "1" in the ground-truth source list determines whether the calculated accuracy is balanced. To obtain a balanced accuracy value and guarantee the fairness of evaluation, we set the number of local clients trained with the data from the target subject as half of the total number of clients as default without additional illustration, which means that half of the ground-truth source list is "1". Because we implement our SLSIA at the first round of FL, setting half of the total number of clients to be trained with the data of the target subject will not impact the attack performance as the FL aggregation is applied after the first FL round.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we implement our SLSIA at the first round of FL, the original task’s performance is inevitably relatively low (even close to random guess) compared to the well-trained models. For FEMNIST, the accuracy of the local clients on the digit classification task is about 6% to 18% (total of 10 digits), relatively higher than random guess (10%). For Shakespeare, the next word prediction accuracy of local models in the first round is about 1% to 4%, which is more significant than the random guess due to the size of the word dictionary being 30353 in our filtered Shakespeare dataset. For Synthetic, the XOR value prediction with the artificially generated features has an accuracy of about 40% to 80%, higher than the random guess (50%). As the mentioned accuracy is obtained in the first round of FL, it is expected to have a relatively lower performance, corresponding to our observations.</p>

Following the strategy presented by Hu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, this approach considers potential target local clients as the ones that, using their local model updates, produce the smallest average loss across the clients.

Then, the local clients who get the minimum loss value more frequently are determined as potential target local clients. This is motivated by setting a threshold on the loss value of the data from the target subject in the previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> .
The method described in the original paper relies on the intuition that if the local model has been trained using data points from the target subject, the resulting loss on the data of the target subject will be lower than a given threshold concerning random data points from other subjects.
In our implementation, instead of setting a fixed threshold, we count how many times a client registers the lowest loss on the evaluation data points of the target subject (<math id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="D_{s_{t}}^{e}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><msubsup id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml">D</mi><msub id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">s</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">e</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2">𝐷</ci><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.2">𝑠</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.3">𝑡</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">𝑒</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.3.m3.1c">D_{s_{t}}^{e}</annotation></semantics></math>) after one training round of FL.
To make a fair comparison, we only implement those two methods in the first round as our SLSIA.
In our scenario, we allow the possibility that more than one client can train their local clients using samples from the subject target. Suppose we follow the work of Hu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to determine the one with the lowest average loss or maximum number of times to obtain the minimum loss in the <span id="S5.SS2.p1.3.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p1.3.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> methods as the target local client. In that case, we can not find all the target local clients, which is unsuitable for our scenario. Besides, finding a threshold suitable to determine which clients are target local clients for all training tasks is not easy. Hence, to make <span id="S5.SS2.p1.3.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p1.3.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> methods applicable to our scenario, we assume that the attacker knows precisely the number of target local clients, which is a strong assumption in a practical scenario. Our solution does not require this prerequisite, allowing us to relax this assumption and making it more realistic compared to the state of the art.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To compare the performance of the attacks, we randomly select 50 subjects as the target subjects of 50 runs in each dataset and obtain the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 of each subject under each method as mentioned in Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Evaluation metrics ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>.

Our two methods (CNN-based and SVM-based SLSIA) obtain higher accuracy than others. In particular, the number of runs (subjects) with an accuracy higher than 0.9 reaches 35 and 32 with our methods under the Synthetic dataset, which is significantly higher than the other two methods (<span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span>: 1 and <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span>: 0). For the Shakespeare dataset, <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SLSIA (CNN)</span> has seven runs with an accuracy higher than 0.9 while <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SLSIA (SVM)</span> has eight runs, compared to 1 for the <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> and 0 for the <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> methods. In the FEMNIST dataset, only <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SLSIA (CNN)</span> has two runs with an accuracy higher than 0.9. It shows that the performance of our SLSIA is better than that of the other two methods. Besides, the attack performance is related to the datasets themselves from the results of the three datasets. For the FEMNIST dataset, this kind of performance is expected due to the high similarity between the styles of the different writers. In Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Analysis ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>, we better prove this point by providing an in-depth analysis of the subject property in each dataset concerning the resulting attack performance.</p>

The inefficiency of those two methods indicates that the model trained with the data from the target subject will not obtain a lower loss and will not frequently get a minor loss among all local models on evaluation data points from the target subject. There are two reasons behind this phenomenon. First, the evaluation data points from the target subject are not included in the weight update during FL training, which can not guarantee a lower loss and frequent minor loss. The second reason is that the local model trains one round of FL before attacking, which makes the local model learn insufficient information from the target subject’s data (<math id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="D_{s_{t}}^{c}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">D</mi><msub id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">s</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><mi id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">c</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝐷</ci><apply id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2">𝑠</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3">𝑡</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑐</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">D_{s_{t}}^{c}</annotation></semantics></math>). It is hard to determine the FL round where the target local clients learn better from the target subject data than random local clients. It is also one of the reasons that led us to perform our SLSIA at the first FL round.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The average metric values of our SLSIA are mostly higher than the <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> and <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> methods. For example, under the Synthetic dataset, <span id="S5.SS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SLSIA (CNN)</span> obtains an average accuracy of 0.88, compared to 0.45 and 0.38 of the two previous methods.

The attack performance of our SLSIA on Shakespeare and Synthetic datasets empirically proves the effectiveness of our attack. For the FEMNIST dataset, our SLSIA has a higher average accuracy but is lower on the other three metrics, especially in F1, compared with the two previous methods. We attribute the low performance of our SLSIA on the FEMNIST to the fact that most subjects are not distinguishable enough, which is also mentioned in Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Analysis ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>.</p>

Looking at the results for the Synthetic dataset, Figure <a href="#S5.F3.sf3" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 5.3 Analysis ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(c)</span></a>, we can see the separation between the "in" embeddings (yellow) and the "out" embeddings (blue) generated by both pre-trained and local models, which means the binary attack model trained with the embeddings using the embeddings obtained from pre-trained models still performs well on the local models in the Synthetic dataset.
Looking at the Shakespeare dataset instead, Figure <a href="#S5.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 5.3 Analysis ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a>, there is a partial overlapping area between the "in" and "out" embeddings, and each is characterized by multiple separated clusters rather than a big, more cohesive one, which reduces the transferability of the binary attack model. The "in" and "out" embeddings are divided into more clusters in FEMNIST, Figure <a href="#S5.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 5.3 Analysis ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a>, and even the "in" (or "out") embeddings from pre-trained models are not in the same area. In this case, we can find a classifier to separate the "in" and "out" embeddings from pre-trained models early. However, this model is hard to use in classifying the embeddings from the local clients, which brings low performance to the FEMNIST.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">From Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5.2 Attack Performance ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we observe that the accuracy of the attack varies from close to 0 to 1. To further explore the reason behind accuracy variance, we measure the average input feature distance between the target and other random subjects in the training data of pre-trained and local models. Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.3 Analysis ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> exposes the average input feature distance of the target subject with a high accuracy and the target subject with a low accuracy under each dataset. As expected, the table shows that the target subject with high attack accuracy has input features relatively far from other random subjects, unlike the target subject with relatively low accuracy, which has relatively compact input features among target and random subjects.
The average input feature distance is the average pair-wise Euclidean distance between two subjects’ flattened data input features. For example, the target subject with an accuracy of 0.8 in FEMNIST has average input feature distances of 5.413, 5.472, 5.383, and 5.340, which are about 8% higher than the target subject with an accuracy of 0.1 with distances of 5.018, 5.065, 4.780, and 4.738. Other datasets have a similar phenomenon with different input feature distance gap levels. We note that Shakespeare’s average input feature distance is enormous as we use the index of words in the dictionary as the input feature rather than the embedding of each word after the embedding layer. It will not change the comparison of high and low-accuracy target subjects, as the embedding for the same word is the same. From the above analysis, we conclude that the target subjects, separate from other random subjects, are more vulnerable to our SLSIA. By comparing the average actual (rather than the dictionary index in Shakespeare) input feature distance between the FEMNIST and Synthetic datasets and the attack performance in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2 Attack Performance ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we can also observe the dataset with a relatively higher average input feature distance will have a relatively higher attack accuracy under our SLSIA. In other words, the dataset with subjects slightly far from each other is more vulnerable. If the subject is relatively far from other subjects, the models could learn separate embeddings for its data points, which makes the binary attack model easier to learn and transfer from the pre-trained models to the local models.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To explore the factors influencing our SLSIA, we selected ten subjects with relatively high performance from the 50 subjects mentioned before for attacking under different conditions. Due to the space limitation, we show the average accuracy as it can reflect the performance alteration. This ablation study is structured in three parts: (1) we change the percentage of the target subject’s data points in the local client, (2) we test different layers for the generation of the embeddings in input to our attack model, and (3) we test different numbers of local training epochs for both pre-trained and local models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">(1) <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Changing the percentage of the target subject’s data points in the local client</span>. In the default setting, we assign a dataset to each target local client, with half of the data points from the target subject and the other half from a random subject.
Therefore, we change this rate from 50% to 30% and 10% by increasing the number of random subjects and data points from random subjects in each local client and keeping the number of data points from the target subject unchanged. Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.4 Ablation Study ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the average accuracy under various rates. We find that <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> with three datasets and <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> with FEMNIST and Shakespeare will increase their attack performance while decreasing the rate of the data from the target subject. For example, <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> obtains an accuracy of 0.54, 0.56, and 0.63 under the rate of 50%, 30%, and 10% separately with Synthetic. As the rate of data points from the target subject decreases, the total number of data points in the training data of the local client increases with the addition of data points from random subjects. More training data points could improve the generalizability of the previous low-performance local model. We guess that more data leads the local model to learn the target subject better. Hence, the evaluation data points from the target subject (<math id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="D_{s_{t}}^{e}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">D</mi><msub id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">s</mi><mi id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><mi id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">e</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝐷</ci><apply id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2">𝑠</ci><ci id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3">𝑡</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑒</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1c">D_{s_{t}}^{e}</annotation></semantics></math>) obtain a lower loss on the local clients trained with the data from the target subject, which makes <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> and <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> a higher attack accuracy. Our SLSIA drops within FEMNIST and Shakespeare while decreasing the rate. However, our SLSIA is still higher than the two previous methods, apart from the Shakespeare under a rate of 10% (10% lower in average accuracy). For Synthetic, our SLSIA achieves accuracy of 0.93 and 0.97 even under a rate of 10%. It indicates that if the subjects are distinguishable enough, our SLSIA could have an average attack accuracy higher than 0.9 with a low rate of data points from the target subject. We attribute the average accuracy drop of our SLSIS with FEMNIST and Shakespeare to the fact that subjects are not distinguishable enough in those two datasets.</p>

The embeddings in input to our attack model can be generated from different layers of target models. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of our attack while generating the embeddings from different layers.
By default, we extract the embeddings from layer 1 in CNN (the flattened output of the second convolutional layer), layer 0 in LSTM (the last hidden state of the LSTM layer), and layer 0 in MLP (the output of the first linear layer). From Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 5.4 Ablation Study ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we can see how the attack accuracy of three target subjects from three datasets with different layers changes. As we can see, our selected layers have relatively higher performance (0.8, 0.8, and 1.0 with CNN-based SLSIA) than the others. This indicates that the early layers of the model, rather than the last two layers (logits and confidence scores) of each model in the table, will expose more information about the data from the target subject. This corresponds to the finding that the early layer will learn easy but distinguishable features while the higher layer will obtain abstract features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.The early layer is beneficial to our SLSIA.</p>

As we mentioned, the low performance of the <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> and <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> methods might be related to the inefficient learning of the model at the first FL round in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Attack Performance ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>. Therefore, we increase the local epoch of the first round to observe the performance alteration in Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 5.4 Ablation Study ‣ 5 Results and Discussions ‣ Subject Data Auditing via Source Inference Attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. We find a similar rule as the exploration of decreasing the rate of data points from the target subject in local clients. <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> and <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> mainly increase their performance with more local training epochs apart from the Synthetic under <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span>. For example, <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> obtains an accuracy of 0.40, 0.54, and 0.78 under the local training epochs of 5, 10, and 15 separately within Synthetic. It indicates more local training epochs at the first FL round increase the performance of the two previous attacking methods, which proves our guess that better learning of the local models will increase their attack performance. Instead of improving the generalizability of the local model via more data points, increasing the local training epoch is also a way to make the local model learn better about the target subject, which reduces the loss of the data points from the target subject and increases the attack performance of <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Avg Loss</span> and <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Min Loss Time</span> as they rely on the low loss of the local client on data points from the target subject. Even though our SLSIA drops with more local training epochs under the FEMNIST and Shakespeare, our SLSIA is still higher than the previous two methods. In Synthetic, our SLSIA obtains an accuracy of over 0.9 under different local training epochs, which also indicates the effectiveness of our SLSIA.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the previous analysis, we conclude that the subject that is relatively far from other subjects is vulnerable under our SLSIA. This finding indicates that training the local models with vulnerable subjects makes them produce more distinguishable embeddings on data from the same vulnerable source.
To eliminate the contribution of data from vulnerable subjects, we employ subject-level differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, which regards data from a subject as a data point in item-level differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, to protect the data from each subject. In the previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, they apply the Hierarchical Gradient Averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> to achieve subject-level differential privacy. We follow their work to implement subject-level differential privacy using the same method and compare it with item-level differential privacy.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p2.12" class="ltx_p">We only apply item-level and subject-level differential privacy in the training of each local client.
Since, in our case, the attacker is an honest but curious server, instead of the user-level differential privacy as in FL averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, we have to defend the local models of the clients rather than the global one to follow the scenario presented by Hu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. 
Unlike the non-private training, applying differential privacy requires clipping the per-sample gradient and adding noise to the averaged gradient.

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The gradient leakage attack utilizes the exposed gradient updates from local clients to recover the training data or labels from local clients. Phong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> show an honest but curious server can extract the training data from partial gradients uploaded by the local client as the division between the gradient on the weight and bias is related to one specific input value (like one image pixel). Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> recover the training data and labels of local clients by the iterative update of dummy inputs and labels to match the gradient update via L-BFGS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
Similarly, in a Vertical Federated Learning configuration, Arazzi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> propose a gradients leaking approach exploiting the matching between the partial gradients returned by the server to obtain the private labels unavailable to the passive parties.
Considering the inconsistency of convergence and discovering ground-truth labels in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> propose a reliable method to extract ground-truth labels from shared gradients via observing the signs of gradients on the parameters of the last layer. Geiping et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> utilize Adam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to optimize a cosine similarity with a regularization term about the total variation of the input to align the gradient updates of original and reconstructed inputs instead of a Euclidean loss optimized with L-BFGS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> in previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The reconstruction attack targets reconstructing local clients’ training data with information not limited to the uploaded gradients. Usually, it uses the GAN to help the reconstruction process. Hitaj et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> implement a GAN-based reconstruction attack, which generates the images belonging to the label that the adversary (a malicious federation user) does not hold. Specifically, the adversary trains a local GAN to generate images whose label is in a victim user by utilizing the global model as the discriminator and mislabeling the generated images as the label the adversary holds, which makes the victim user reveal more information about the target label of the adversary.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel approach for a source inference attack in Cross-Silo Federated Learning.
Due to its characteristics, our attack can be successfully adopted as a data auditing tool to assess whether data from a specific subject have been used during the FL task.
To develop our solution, we leveraged the early embedding of local models to expose whether their training data contained data points from a specific target subject. Specifically, we audit the subject data usage of local clients by training an attack model to predict whether an embedding associated with a data point is produced by a model originally trained with data from a target subject. The relatively higher attack performance of our SLSIA on three datasets than those of previous methods empirically proves its adequateness for subject data auditing. Analyzing the embeddings and the input feature distance, we found that datasets with more distinguishable subjects are more vulnerable to our SLSIA. The subject-level differential privacy can significantly decrease the accuracy of our SLSIA with a considerable utility drop of the global FL model and, in most cases, cannot prevent our SLSIA completely.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As we assume that the central server will select all local models for updating the global model in the first round, we leave the extension to scenarios where not all local models are utilized at once as one of future work. Besides, a potential direction to improve our solution is identifying strategies to reduce the data from the target subject required for the inference attack. This is especially relevant in scenarios in which the distribution of data from different subjects is similar. In addition, an efficient and less impacting defense mechanism is also needed, as differential privacy greatly compromises the original task performance.</p>
