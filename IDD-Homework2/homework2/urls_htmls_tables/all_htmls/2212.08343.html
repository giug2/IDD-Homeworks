<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">A fundamental challenge to providing edge-AI services is the need for a machine learning (ML) model that achieves personalization (i.e., to individual clients) and generalization (i.e., to unseen data) properties concurrently. Existing techniques in federated learning (FL) have encountered a steep tradeoff between these objectives and impose large computational requirements on edge devices during training and inference. In this paper, we propose SplitGP, a new split learning solution that can simultaneously capture generalization and personalization capabilities for efficient inference across resource-constrained clients (e.g., mobile/IoT devices). Our key
idea is to split the full ML model into client-side and server-side
components, and impose different roles to them: the client-side model is trained to have strong personalization capability optimized to each client’s main task, while the server-side model is trained to have strong generalization capability for handling all clients’ out-of-distribution tasks. We analytically characterize the convergence behavior of SplitGP, revealing that all client models approach stationary points asymptotically. Further, we analyze the inference time in SplitGP and provide bounds for determining model split ratios. Experimental results show that SplitGP outperforms existing baselines by wide margins in inference time and test accuracy for varying amounts of out-of-distribution samples.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing prevalence of mobile and Internet-of Things (IoT) devices, there is an explosion in demand for machine learning (ML) functionality across the intelligent network edge. From the service provider’s perspective, providing a high-quality edge-AI service to individual clientsis of paramount importance: given newly collected data, the goal of each client is to apply the provided ML model for inference/decisioning.
However, there are two critical challenges that need to be handled to satisfy the client needs in practical edge-AI settings.

We refer to these as a client’s main classes and out-of-distribution classes, respectively. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the most recently popularized technique for distributing ML across edge devices, has demonstrated a sharp tradeoff between these objectives.

For example, a global activity recognition classifier for wearables learned via FL would be optimized for classes of activities observed over all users. We term the capability to classify all classes as “generalization”. The generalized global model is a good option when the input data distribution appearing at each client during inference resembles the global training distribution. However, when the data distributions across clients are significantly non-IID (independent and identically distributed), the globally aggregated FL model may not be the best option for many clients (e.g., consider activity sensors for individuals playing different types of sports). Personalized FL approaches tackle this
problem by providing a customized local model to each client based on their individual local data distributions (e.g., a basketball vs. football player). We term this capability to classify the local classes as “personalization”. </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, when a client needs to make predictions for classes that are not in its local data (i.e., due to distribution shift), the personalized FL model shows much lower performance than the generalized model (see Sec. <a href="#S6" title="VI Experimental Results ‣ SplitGP: Achieving Both Generalization and Personalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>). Hence, it is important to capture both personalization (for handling local classes) and generalization (for handling out-of-distribution classes) in practice where not only the main classes but also the out-of-distribution classes appear occasionally during inference.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Issue 2: Inference requirements.</span> Mobile edge and IoT devices suffer from limited storage and computation resources. As a result, it is challenging to deploy large-scale models (e.g., neural networks with millions of parameters) at individual clients for inference tasks without incurring significant costs. Deploying the full model at a nearby edge server can be another option, but this approach requires direct transmissions of raw data from the client during inference, and can also incur noticeable latency. Moreover, under this framework, when client models are personalized, the server would need to store all of these variations, which presents scalability challenges.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">These two issues are thus significant obstacles to high quality edge-AI services, with existing approaches falling short of addressing them simultaneously.

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Overview of approach.</span> To address this question, we propose SplitGP, a new split learning (SL) solution for generalization and personalization in FL settings. Our key idea is to split the full model into two parts, client-side and server-side, and impose different roles to them during inference. The client-side model should have strong <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalization capability</span>, where the goal is to work well on each user’s local distribution. On the other hand, the server-side model, shared by all clients in the system, should have strong <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">generalization capability</span> across the tasks of all users. During inference, each client solves its personalized task, i.e., for its main classes, using the client-side model. When the client has to make a prediction that is not related to its personalized task, i.e., for out-of-distribution classes, they can send the output feature from the client-side model to the server-side model, and receive the predicted result back from the edge server. We will show that this combination of model splitting and edge computing captures both personalization and generalization while reducing the storage, computational load and latency during inference compared to existing methods where the full model is provided to individual clients. SplitGP also has significant advantages in terms of privacy and latency compared to schemes where the full model is deployed at the server-side.

However, these strategies do not achieve generalization and personalization simultaneously, and thus are not the best options in practice where not only the main classes and but also the out-of-distribution classes appear occasionally during inference. In this respect, a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed simultaneously constructing generalized and personalized models in FL with two models sharing the same feature extractor. In practice, the full model would need to be deployed at each client for achieving personalization during inference, which is challenging in the edge-AI scenarios we consider with resource-constrained clients.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Split learning.</span>
Recently, various SL schemes have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to reduce client-side storage and computation requirements during training compared to FL. The training process of our approach draws from concepts in SL in that we divide the full model into client-side and server-side components. However, existing works on SL including <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> do not focus on capturing both generalization and personalization simultaneously. Compared to existing works, we consider a new inference scenario where the clients should make predictions frequently for the main classes but also occasionally for the out-of-distribution classes, and design a solution tailored to this setup. We also let clients to frequently make predictions using only the client-side model (instead of the full model), which results in reduced inference time.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Efficient edge-AI inference.</span>
Only a few prior works in distributed ML have focused on the inference stage of the clients at the edge. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed to deploy distributed deep neural networks on the server and devices during inference, using multi-exit neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Our approach also borrows the concept of multi-exit neural networks with two exits to make predictions both at the client-side and at the server-side. However, these previous works have assumed that the model training phase occurs in a centralized manner, which does not consider the important challenge of non-IID local datasets in FL/SL setups where raw data remains at the devices. In practical settings where each client observes main and out-of-distribution classes during inference, incorporating personalization and generalization results in significant performance enhancements during inference, as we will see in Sec. <a href="#S6" title="VI Experimental Results ‣ SplitGP: Achieving Both Generalization and Personalization in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p4.15" class="ltx_p">which enables the client-side model to make reliable predictions on the out-of-distribution classes. Although generalization is not the main goal of the client model, conducting inference for out-of-distribution classes at the client when possible will further reduce communication cost and latency. Moreover, during inference, the client does not automatically know whether a datapoint is from one of its main classes or not. We therefore introduce a confidence threshold for the inference stage in Sec. III-C which chooses between client and server-side inference.</p>

First, we consider the personalized FL scheme proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, where the trained personalized models are deployed at individual clients during inference. We also consider a generalized global model constructed via conventional FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> as well as SplitFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Note that FL and SplitFed produce the same model while SplitFed can save storage and computation resources during training. This generalized global model can be deployed either at the client or at the server. Finally, we consider a multi-exit neural network that has two exits, one at the client-side and the other at the server-side, constructed via FL or SL. For a fair comparison, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is adopted for the model aggregation process of all schemes.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a hybrid federated and split learning methodology, termed SplitGP, which captures both personalization and generalization needs for reliable/efficient inference at resource-constrained clients. We analytically characterized the convergence of our algorithm, and provided guidelines on model splitting based on inference time analysis. Experimental results on real-world datasets confirmed the advantage of SplitGP in practical settings where each client needs to make predictions frequently for its main classes but also occasionally for its out-of-distribution classes.</p>
