<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a recently developed area of machine learning, in which the private data of a large number of distributed clients is used to develop a global model under the coordination of a central server without explicitly exposing the data. The standard FL strategy has a number of significant bottlenecks including large communication requirements and high impact on the clients’ resources. Several strategies have been described in the literature trying to address these issues.
In this paper, a novel scheme based on the notion of “model growing” is proposed. Initially, the server deploys a small model of low complexity, which is trained to capture the data complexity during the initial set of rounds. When the performance of such a model saturates, the server switches to a larger model with the help of <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">function-preserving transformations</span>.
The model complexity increases as more data is processed by the clients, and the overall process continues until the desired performance is achieved. Therefore, the most complex model is broadcast only at the final stage in our approach resulting in substantial reduction in communication cost and client computational requirements. The proposed approach is tested extensively on three standard benchmarks and is shown to achieve substantial reduction in communication and client computation while achieving comparable accuracy when compared to the current most effective strategies.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a new machine learning (ML) paradigm that enables the training of a model by utilizing private data distributed across many clients governed by a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In contrast to the traditional ML, where all samples are stored in a single place, FL assumes that the data are generated and collected by many distributed, independent clients. Therefore, the overall data is expected to be heterogeneous and non-IID (Identically and Independently Distributed).
In training, the server broadcasts the current global model to a set of randomly selected clients. Each selected client locally trains the received model with its private data and sends the updates to the server. The server aggregates the updates on the current model using federated averaging. This constitutes a single communication round. This procedure is repeated for many communication rounds, where in each round the randomly selected clients advance the training, until convergence is achieved. FL has been growing in importance especially with the emergence of edge computing and AI on the edge due to the massive deployment of IoT devices and advances in communication and networking systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the most general setting, the standard FL strategy has a number of significant bottlenecks that need to be addressed before it can be widely used in practice. These bottlenecks include data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, unreliable and variable rate connectivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, uneven and relatively limited client resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, high communication requirement, and high impact on the clients’ resources. Strategies to address these bottlenecks is suggested in the literature, see for example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> but here we focus our attention on the two bottlenecks of communication requirements and the limited client resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Three approaches have been suggested to reduce the communication requirement and achieve comparable performance to the standard FL.
The first, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, relies on quantization methods; the second relies on the sparsification of the model update as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>; and the third approach broadcasts smaller networks to improve communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another constraint is the relatively limited resources available at the clients. In general, whenever a state-of-the-art model is required to capture the global heterogeneous data complexity, FL induces a significant computational overhead on the clients.
Therefore, we should aim at reducing the computational requirements on the clients. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, federated dropout is introduced in which random sub-networks of the entire model are broadcast thereby reducing communication bandwidth and computational resources.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the introduction of federated averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, reducing communication bandwidth and local computation has received a great deal of interest in the community.
Most of the work tried to improve communication efficiency, which can be broadly categorized into model compression based techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, update sparsification based techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> or broadcasting smaller networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Model compression techniques involve mainly quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, compressed sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, low rank approximation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and tensor decomposition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. The approach in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> combines sparsification of gradient updates with quantization for reducing the client-to-server communication cost. Model pruning technique has been used for communicating smaller networks, for example by applying the lottery ticket hypothesis for pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> partitions the model into local parameters for representation learning and global parameters for broadcasting by training the whole model locally.
Significant savings is not expected from models having fully connected (FC) layers at the bottom as they possess most of the parameters of the entire model.
Moreover, for testing new client data, the scheme needs to pass the data through all local models and ensemble the outputs, which is not suitable in practice.
Some of the works avoid communicating the entire model by replacing it with either logits from model outputs as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> or binary masks as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The above schemes mostly improve communication efficiency but do not deal directly with possible computation savings at the client side. To achieve this objective, the typical approach
used is mainly focused on broadcasting a subnetwork to clients. For example,
federated dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and adaptive federated dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> randomly drop out a fixed percentage of units or filters to broadcast a sub-network combined with lossy compression at each round.
Unlike the other knowledge distillation based methods, the approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> trains small models on clients and transfers their knowledge to a large server-side model. The approach used in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> only communicates and learns personalized binary masks, while freezing the model parameters. This idea, however, restricts the model to update its weights. On the other hand, the method described in
HeteroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> broadcasts submodels to clients based on their computation capability assuming that this knowledge is present to the server.
All the discussed methods consider a single global model throughout the entire training.
We just found out that a concurrently developed method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> progressively adds randomly initialized layers (or blocks) from the final model architecture with new classification layers at specific intervals. We expect this scheme to result in a drop of performance at the beginning of each stage and hence, we believe its performance will be significantly lower than ours.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Proposed Approach</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We develop a modified training scheme to make the local training computationally much less demanding and reduce the communication requirement while maintaining accuracy.
We observe that to achieve a state-of-the-art accuracy, a model needs to capture the essential characteristics of the global data held in the clients, which are known only after the participation of a large number of clients. However, it is not necessary to broadcast such a model throughout the entire training. At the beginning, the model starts with a small amount of data available at relatively few clients, and then progresses with additional information after each round of FL.
Intuitively, a model with much lower complexity can be deployed at the beginning and then, we can exploit transfer learning strategies to transfer the knowledge from a lower complexity model to a higher complexity model. In this way, the complexity of the model grows as the data complexity increases, until we reach a final model that can capture the global data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our approach is based on transfer learning, but in a different way than standard transfer learning in which the top layers of a student network are directly copied from a teacher network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Instead, the strategy of function-preserving transformations introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is utilized, where the student network is initialized in such a way that it represents the same function as the teacher but with different parameterization. We start federated training with a small network. As the training proceeds and more data from clients are exposed, the model is enlarged using two transformations. The first is Net2Widernet, which replaces a model with an equivalent model that is wider, i.e. the student model will have a larger number of units at a certain layer(s). The second operation is Net2DeeperNet, which replaces a model with an equivalent deeper model. These two transformations constitute the essential components of Net2Net. Each transformation preserves the function of the network. After initializing the student network that has the same function as the teacher network, the student network is trained further to improve performance, and once no improvement is detected, the network is enlarged using the Net2Net transformations. We call our scheme FedNet2Net after the Net2Net methodology. Details are presented next.</p>

During each stage, the model is deployed after enlarging it by applying a functional preserving transformation to meet the growing data complexity without degradation in performance. In this way, we continue to train a model until its progress saturates after which we switch to the next model.

We observe that since the highest complexity model is broadcast only at the final stage, we achieve a large reduction in communication bandwidth and clients’ computational requirements while achieving similar performance as in the standard FL.
In a federated setting, FedNet2Net can be a life long learner and can adapt over a long period of time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

Similar transformation can be realized for FC layers. More details regarding the transformations appear in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
This operation preserves the function value, that is, for any sample, the function value of the model before and after the transformation remains the same. As we have dropout layers in our models, no extra noise adding is needed for advancing the training since the dropout technique achieves the same goal.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For performance evaluation, we plot the accuracy against total communication of all methods and the reduction in average communication per round versus the accuracy of our approaches over the baselines. The second plot can be used to determine the communication saved for a desired accuracy, and to determine the number of clients that can participate at a round. While not mentioned explicitly, similar reduction in the amount of computations is achieved since the models used are much smaller for the majority of the rounds (if not all).
All methods are trained for 6000 rounds and for convenience, the test accuracy is recorded after every 50 rounds.</p>

The figures on the left present the accuracy against total communication (in bits) with switching positions in our approach. We observe that for any fixed amount of communication, FedNet2Net achieves higher and occasionally equal accuracy compared to FedAvg, federated dropout and HeteroFL; the only exception is the performance of HeteroFL on CIFAR10 at the high accuracy end, which we believe is due to adding batch normalization layers in HeteroFL, which boosted the training. Otherwise, HeteroFL training is highly unstable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The figures on the right present the percentage reduction in communication per round of FNN over FedAvg, FNN-FD over FD, FD over FedAvg, HeteroFL over FedAvg and FNN-FD over FedAvg.
It is observed that, at the slightly lower accuracy regions than the best possible, the percentage savings is approximately more than 90% per round. This saving remains constant for most of the accuracy regions. At the higher accuracy region, the percentage savings starts to drop, which intuitively makes sense as we are switching to larger models to capture the growing data complexity. Moreover, the reduction of FD and HeteroFL over FedAvg remains the same for all accuracies as they broadcast roughly the same number of parameters at all rounds. However, additional per round communication savings is achieved by combining FedNet2Net with FD.
Similar reduction is achieved when we separated a validation set from the training data to measure validation accuracy for making switching decisions.
Therefore, our training approach based on model growing reduces significant amount of communication per round. Moreover, as our approach starts from a significantly small model and gets transformed into a higher capacity model, it opens the opportunity to adapt the model as data complexity grows.</p>

<p id="S5.SS0.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the final model, we implement FedNet2net with a different set of intermediate models to show the effect of choosing them differently. For EMNIST, we implement FedNet2Net with sets of 6 and 8 models (FNN-6 and FNN-8), and the results are presented in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.0.1 Effect of choosing the different set of intermediate models. ‣ 5 Results ‣ FedNet2Net: Saving Communication and Computations in Federated Learning with Model GrowingPartially supported by a DOD contract to the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. FNN-8 has a smaller starting network than FNN-6. We observe that FNN-8 performs better than FNN-6 in terms of communication reductions. This is intuitive as the final model is broadcast for lesser number of rounds. Similarly for CIFAR10, we implement FedNet2Net by changing some of the intermediate models mentioned in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.3 Parameters for Switching ‣ 4 Datasets and Detailed Model Implementations ‣ FedNet2Net: Saving Communication and Computations in Federated Learning with Model GrowingPartially supported by a DOD contract to the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a new federated training scheme, based on the model growing strategy, is proposed for saving both communication cost and computations at the clients. At the initial stage, as the model is trained using only a small amount of data, deploying a model with minimal capacity saves both communication and local computation.
Next, the efficient switchings to the enlarged models using function-preserving transformations ensure a continuous improvement in performance as long as the complexity of the data increases.
In this way, the capacity of the model is increased until the model captures the overall data complexity.
The most complex model is deployed only at the final stages of training, and thereby, saving a substantial amount of communication and local computations.
Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed FedNet2Net training scheme can save significant amount of communication cost and local computations per round.</p>
