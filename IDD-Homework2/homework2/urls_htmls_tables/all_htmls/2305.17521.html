<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We present a novel privacy-preserving model aggregation for asynchronous federated learning, named PPA-AFL that removes the restriction of synchronous aggregation of local model updates in federated learning, while enabling the protection of the local model updates against the server. In PPA-AFL, clients can proactive decide when to engage in the training process, and sends local model updates to the server when the updates are available. Thus, it is not necessary to keep synchronicity with other clients. To safeguard client updates and facilitate local model aggregation, we employ Paillier encryption for local update encryption and support homomorphic aggregation. Furthermore, secret sharing is utilized to enable the sharing of decryption keys and facilitate privacy-preserving asynchronous aggregation. As a result, the server remains unable to gain any information about the local updates while asynchronously aggregating to produce the global model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed PPA-AFL framework through comprehensive complexity analysis and extensive experiments on a prototype implementation, highlighting its potential for practical adoption in privacy-sensitive asynchronous federated learning scenarios. <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>A part of the study has been published in Jianxiang Zhao’s Master thesis.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of IT infrastructure, a massive amount of data has become available, making machine learning-based solutions more feasible and cost-effective. Federated learning, a novel collaborative machine learning approach, addresses data barriers across diverse clients by utilizing more data for training without violating privacy regulations. In a typical client-server model, a group of clients collaborates with an aggregation server to form a ”federation” for training a global model that benefits from data owned by different clients. This interactive training process requires clients and the server to frequently communicate in a synchronous manner. During each training round, a client receives the latest global model from the server, trains its local model using its local dataset, and sends model updates (e.g., gradients, model parameters) to the server. The server then generates the next global model version through an aggregation process that takes local model updates as input. Throughout this process, raw data never leaves its owner, providing basic privacy protection for participating clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, while offering privacy benefits, may still leak sensitive client information due to model inversion and membership inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. To protect local model privacy, existing works employ various methods such as differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) techniques, including homomorphic encryption (e.g., Paillier encryption) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and Multi-Party Computation (MPC), have also been explored. However, both homomorphic encryption and MPC-based approaches suffer from lower efficiency compared to the original federated learning, limiting their practical application in real-world projects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Bonawitz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed Secure Aggregation (SecAgg) for federated learning to address the trade-off between model privacy and aggregation efficiency. The noise used to protect model updates are pairwise negotiated between clients to make sure that the sum of noise added by all clients is zero. Considering clients may drop unexpectedly in any step of the protocol and cause the result incorrect, the server needs to collect the secret shares from online clients and recover the secret for every dropped client. However, its synchronized workflow, which requires devices to wait for the slowest one, leads to accumulated idling time and reduced efficiency compared to the original federated learning approach.
Asynchronous federated learning can have higher utilization of computing power and communication bandwidth for devices, which increases the overall efficiency of the system. However, asynchronous federated learning cannot use the original federated aggregation algorithm, because the updates from clients are not based on the same version of a global model. To handle this problem, clients’ models should always have tags to denote the version of the global model. The update of the global model can happen when the clients’ updates come, by using the mixing algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, or when there is a certain number of updates from clients received, by using weighted aggregation with staleness function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Both methods can modify federated learning into an asynchronous alternative. However, privacy preservation becomes a concern, because mask-based secure aggregation requires synchronization. The aggregation method of one-shot recovery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> allows clients to communicate with the server without synchronization in the early rounds of one training epoch, but synchronization is still required when one-shot mask removal happens. So et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed secure aggregation in buffered asynchronous federated learning, in which the server maintains a buffer to temporarily store the coming updates and performs the aggregation and updates the global model when the buffer is full.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study the method to achieve secure aggregation for fully asynchronous federated learning and propose a Privacy-Preserving Asynchronous Federated Learning protocol (PPA-AFL) which facilitates secure aggregation of clients’ local models while enhancing the efficiency of global model training. The conflict between local model leakage and local model aggregation is addressed by employing Paillier encryption in asynchronous federated learning, ensuring that clients’ updates’ cleartext remains concealed while maintaining the same aggregation result. By implementing a dual-server setting and threshold secret sharing, local model aggregation is only executed when a specific number of clients’ updates are received, effectively mitigating the risk of global model leakage related to individual clients by reducing the contribution proportion of single clients in each aggregation.
The proposed protocol offers full asynchronicity from the clients’ perspective, allowing them to determine their participation and eliminating the requirement for continuous online presence until aggregation. Consequently, the overhead imposed on clients by the system is comparable to that of the original federated learning approach.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In PPL-AFL, the security goals, specifically local model privacy and threshold aggregation, are discussed under two threat models. The first one is all parties are honest but curious. The second threat model is some clients are malicious. When assuming all parties are honest but curious, it is demonstrated that local model privacy is protected, and model aggregation does not occur before the threshold is reached.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A client intending to join federated training first sends a request to the encryption server, receiving a response containing an encryption key generated by the server. The client conducts local training and uses the encryption key to encrypt the local model. All encrypted local models are transmitted to the aggregation server, where aggregation is performed on the ciphertext of local models. The aggregated result is then sent to the encryption server for decryption. Throughout this process, the local model plaintext remains on the local device. Due to the security of the Paillier encryption, without the decryption key, the probability of an adversary distinguishing a ciphertext from a random string in the cipher space is negligible, ensuring the aggregation server and potential eavesdroppers cannot extract information from the ciphertext of local models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Alongside the encryption key, the encryption server provides a secret share to the client. These shares are submitted to the aggregation server when clients send their updates. To decrypt the global model’s ciphertext, the aggregation server must provide these shares to the encryption server. If the secret can be reconstructed from the shares, the encryption server performs decryption; otherwise, the request is denied. Based on the Shamir’s secret sharing scheme, secrets cannot be reconstructed without a sufficient number of shares, compelling the aggregation server to execute the threshold aggregation honestly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">If some clients are malicious, malicious clients may request encryption keys and secret shares from the encryption server at a high frequency. To make such requests, a malicious client must expose its identity to the encryption server. By maintaining a record of requests, the encryption server can easily detect this attack, allowing for the suspension of the abnormal client and associated aggregation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We implement our PPA-AFL in java and acquire the running time. The computers have the CPU Intel Core i7-10750H, Intel Xeon W-2255, and AMD Ryzen 7 4800U. The CPU frequency is locked at 2.60GHz, 3.70GHz, and 1.80GHz, respectively. The above-mentioned hardware is selected to simulate the setting of a relatively powerful personal PC, a common business server, and a slim laptop. The operating system is the latest version of Windows 11. All programs only use a single thread to run.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a fully asynchronous secure federated learning protocol, which mitigates the effects of device heterogeneity during federated training. The proposed protocol enables federated learning to maximize the use of clients’ computational resources, facilitating frequent aggregations when other factors remain constant. Asynchronous aggregation also results in reduced impact from communication latency on the system. Collectively, these advantages contribute to the robust performance in practical applications. However, a notable limitation of the proposed protocol is the requirement for two non-colluding servers. This constraint prevents the protocol’s implementation in scenarios where only one party can serve as a server or when the parties acting as servers have the motivation to collude.</p>
