<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">With the development and the increasing interests in ML/DL fields, companies are eager to apply Machine Learning/Deep Learning approaches to increase service quality and customer experience. Federated Learning was implemented as an effective model training method for distributing and accelerating time-consuming model training while protecting user data privacy. However, common Federated Learning approaches, on the other hand, use a synchronous protocol to conduct model aggregation, which is inflexible and unable to adapt to rapidly changing environments and heterogeneous hardware settings in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present an approach to real-time end-to-end Federated Learning combined with a novel asynchronous model aggregation protocol. Our method is validated in an industrial use case in the automotive domain, focusing on steering wheel angle prediction for autonomous driving. Our findings show that asynchronous Federated Learning can significantly improve the prediction performance of local edge models while maintaining the same level of accuracy as centralized machine learning. Furthermore, by using a sliding training window, the approach can minimize communication overhead, accelerate model training speed and consume real-time streaming data, proving high efficiency when deploying ML/DL components to heterogeneous real-world embedded systems.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of distributed edge computer computing and storage capabilities, using computation resources on the edge becomes a viable option <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Federated Learning has been adopted as a cost-effective solution due to its model-only sharing and parallel training characteristics. A simple diagram of a Federated Learning system is shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Real-time End-to-End Federated Learning: An Automotive Case Study" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Local model training is carried out in this framework, and data generated by edge devices do not need to be shared. Weight updates are instead sent to a central aggregation server, which generates the global model. The method overcomes the shortcomings of the conventional centralized Machine Learning approach, which only conducts model training on a single central server, such as data privacy, massive bandwidth costs, and long model training time.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper builds on our previous research, “End-to-End Federated Learning for Autonomous Driving Vehicles” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">end-to-end</span>]</cite>, in which we discovered that Federated Learning can significantly reduce model training time and bandwidth consumption. However, with the synchronous aggregation protocols used in our previous research and current Federated Learning applications and analysis, such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, we realized that it is difficult for businesses to incorporate Federated Learning components into their software products <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Until model aggregation, a synchronous aggregation protocol requires the server to wait for all of the edge devices to complete their training rounds. Since real-world systems may include heterogeneous hardware configurations and network environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, the aggregation server cannot expect all participating edge devices to upload their local models at the same time. The situation will become worse and unmanageable with the increasing number of edge devices. Furthermore, our previous research also identified the challenges of deploying AI/ML components into a real-world industrial context. As J. Bosch et al. defined in <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">”Engineering AI Systems: A Research Agenda”</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, AI engineering refers to AI/ML-driven software development and deployment in production contexts. We found that the transition from prototype to the production-quality deployment of ML models proves to be challenging for many companies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, in order to put Federated Learning into effect, in this paper, we present a novel method for consuming real-time streaming data for Federated Learning and combining it with the asynchronous aggregation protocol. This paper makes three contributions. First, we employ Federated Learning, a distributed machine learning technique, and validate it with a key automotive use case, steering wheel angle prediction in the field of autonomous driving, which is also a classic end-to-end learning problem. Second, we present a real-time end-to-end Federated Learning method for training Machine Learning models in a distributed context. Third, we empirically evaluate our approach on the real-world autonomous driving data sets. Based on our findings, we show the effectiveness of our method over other methods of learning, including the common synchronous Federated Learning approach.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the first pioneer research of utilizing the neural network for steering wheel angle prediction is described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The author used pixel information from simulated road images as inputs to predict steering command, which proves that a neural network is able to perform steering angle prediction from image pixel values. Recently, more advanced networks are utilized to predict the steering angles. H. M. Eraqi et al. propose a convolutional long short-term memory (c-LSTM) to learn both visual and dynamic temporal dependencies of driving, which demonstrate more stable steering by 87% <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Shuyang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> designed a 3D-CNN model with LSTM layers to predict steering wheel angles.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of end-to-end learning was first proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, where authors built and constructed a deep convolutional neural network to directly predict steering wheel angles and monitor the steering wheel. In this research, ground truth was directly captured from real-time human behaviour. Their methods demonstrate that a convolutional neural network can learn steering wheel angle directly from input video images without the need for additional road information such as road marking detection, semantic analysis, and so on. In order to enhance model prediction accuracy, we use a two-stream model in our approach. Due to its robustness and lower training cost as compared to other networks such as DNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, 3D-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, RNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and LSTM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the model was first proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and applied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, previous research for this use case has concentrated primarily on the training model in a single-vehicle. We will use Federated Learning in this paper to accelerate model training speed and boost model quality by forming a global awareness of all edge vehicles.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The automotive industry is a promising platform for implementing Machine Learning in a federated manner. Machine learning models can be used to forecast traffic conditions, identify pedestrian behaviour, and assist drivers in making decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.

Saputra et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> forecast the energy demand for electric vehicle networks. They dramatically minimize the bandwidth consumption and efficiently protect sensitive user information for electric vehicle users by using Federated Learning. Samarakoon et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> propose a distributed approach to joint transmit power and resource allocation in vehicular networks that enable low-latency communication. When compared to a centralized approach, the proposed method can reduce waiting queue length without increasing power consumption and achieve comparable model prediction efficiency. Doomra et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> present a Federated Learning-trained long short-term memory (LSTM)-based turn signal prediction (on or off) model. All of these approaches, however, are faced with synchronous aggregation protocols that are unsuitable for real-world heterogeneous hardware.

To conduct our experiments, we chose Dataset 2018 from this collection. The dataset contains various driving data such as road video clips, steering angle on roads, and so on. Dataset 2018 is 3.1 GB in size and contains approximately 63,000 files. This dataset tracks a 6-kilometer path along the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles. Our experiment datasets were chosen from the first 40,000 image frames.</p>

The diagram of the learning process in a single edge vehicle is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV Real-time End-to-End Federated Learning ‣ Real-time End-to-End Federated Learning: An Automotive Case Study" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Images are firstly stored in a fixed-sized storage window in order to conduct real-time end-to-end learning based on the continuous image stream. When the storage window reaches its size limit, the most recent picture frames are moved into the training window, while an equivalent number of old frames are dropped. (In our case, the storage window is 100 images wide and the training window is 2,000 wide. These values provide us with the highest model prediction accuracy.) The optical flow information is measured at the same time. Inside the training window, image frames and optical flow frames are fed into a convolutional neural network. The network’s performance is compared to the ground truth for that picture frame, which is the human driver’s recorded steering wheel angle. Back-propagation is used to adjust the weights of the convolutional neural network in order to enforce the model output as close to the target output as possible.</p>

The results show that the Federated Learning models (synchronous and asynchronous) may achieve the same or even better prediction accuracy than the traditional centralized trained model. The Federated Learning model reacts faster than other learning approaches, particularly at the timestamps that require rapid changes in steering wheel angle. Furthermore, when compared to independently trained models, Federated Learning approaches can provide a much better prediction that is much closer to the ground truth.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The comparison of total training time and bytes transferred between Federated Learning and three baseline models is shown in table <a href="#S5.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ V Results ‣ Real-time End-to-End Federated Learning: An Automotive Case Study" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. For all the models, the total number of training epochs is 50. With async FL, FL, and Local ML learning approaches, model training is accelerated by Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU in edge vehicle 1, while model training is accelerated by Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU in edge vehicle 3, 4. The ML method completes training on a single server with Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU acceleration. As compared to the traditional centralized learning approach, the bandwidth cost of both Federated Learning methods is reduced by approximately 60%. The results for model training time indicate that asynchronous Federated Learning needs significantly less training time than other baseline methods. However, since there is no GPU available for synchronous Federated Learning and local learning, edge vehicle 2 becomes the burden of the entire system. Other vehicles must wait for vehicle 2 to complete its local training round before performing model aggregation and further training tasks, which is inflexible and time-consuming. The performance of these two methods is even lower than that of the centralized learning system with GPU acceleration. In summary, as compared to the traditional centralized learning process, asynchronous Federated Learning reduces training time by approximately 70% and saves approximately 60% bandwidth. Since our method consumes real-time streaming data, there is no need to store and train on a large dataset in a single edge unit, making it cost-effective and relevant to real-world systems.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time end-to-end Federated Learning using a version-based asynchronous aggregation protocol. We validate our approach using a critical use case, steering wheel angle prediction in self-driving cars. Our findings show the model’s strength and advantages when trained using our proposed method. In our case, the model achieves the same or even better prediction accuracy than widely used centralized learning methods and other Federated Learning algorithms while reducing training time by 70% and bandwidth cost by 60%. Note that the decrease would be more visible if the number of participating devices is expanded more, which proves to be cost-effective and relevant to real-world systems.</p>

As the parameter settings become more important with the number of participating learning vehicles increases, we would like to add more federated edge users in order to test device output that may differ with these bounds. In addition, we will test our approach in additional use cases and investigate more sophisticated neural networks combined with our approach. In addition, we plan to develop more appropriate aggregation algorithms and protocols in order to increase model training performance on resource-constrained edge devices in real-world embedded systems.</p>
