<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is highly sensitive to data privacy and cybersecurity threats. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for preserving privacy, enabling private data to remain on local IIoT clients while cooperatively training models to detect network anomalies. However, both synchronous and asynchronous FL architectures exhibit limitations, particularly when dealing with clients with varying speeds due to data heterogeneity and resource constraints. Synchronous architecture suffers from straggler effects, while asynchronous methods encounter communication bottlenecks. Additionally, FL models are prone to adversarial inference attacks aimed at disclosing private training data. To address these challenges, we propose a Buffered FL (BFL) framework empowered by homomorphic encryption for anomaly detection in heterogeneous IIoT environments. BFL utilizes a novel weighted average time approach to mitigate both straggler effects and communication bottlenecks, ensuring fairness between clients with varying processing speeds through collaboration with a buffer-based server. The performance results, derived from two datasets, show the superiority of BFL compared to state-of-the-art FL methods, demonstrating improved accuracy and convergence speed while enhancing privacy preservation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a form of Internet of Things (IoT) implemented in manufacturing and industry to automate processes and produce more effective and appropriate products <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. IIoT offers a multitude of advantages over traditional Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCASA) systems, including productivity, scalability, and data analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Neverthless,
the increase in connected devices and the lack of security design in older control systems make factories vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as denial of service (DoS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In addition to security challenges, data privacy is another critical concern in IIoT environments. This is attributed to the massive amount of data generated by IIoT smart devices, which may encompass sensitive information that service providers are reluctant to disclose to third parties
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. As a result, an imperative arises
for a solution to detect cyber-attacks while maintaining data privacy in IIoT domains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many IIoT contexts have employed centralized machine learning-based anomaly detection schemes as a solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In most cases, centralized schemes lack the flexibility to adapt to different scenarios, particularly with regard to privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This limitation arises from the inherent need of centralized methods to send all IIoT data
to a single location for processing. This makes centralized approaches time-consuming (causing inefficiency in communication) and compromises the privacy of sensitive industrial processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">preserve privacy</span> and improve communication efficiency, federated learning (FL) emerges as an appropriate distributed machine learning technique for IIoT environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. FL allows clients to train a global model collaboratively by transmitting parameters and local models to a server instead of sharing raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This reduces training time and addresses privacy concerns. FL frameworks support synchronous and asynchronous modes of communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Synchronous FL (SFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> requires all clients to submit their local models to the server for aggregation. However, problems may arise when clients train at different speeds due to resource differences, such as differences in memory capacity or heterogeneous data. In this situation, the aggregation server must wait for the slowest client to transmit its local model, resulting in slow convergence speeds and delays. This delay, known as the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">straggler effect</span>, occurs due to resource differences, causing certain clients to lag behind. Therefore, SFL is not suitable for real-time applications. To avoid Straggler effects, asynchronous FL (AFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> was introduced, where aggregation occurs immediately after a client trains its model, without waiting for the slowest client. Nevertheless, most asynchronous approaches experience <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">communication bottlenecks</span> because clients can communicate independently with the aggregation server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To trade off SFL and AFL, buffered base solutions have been proposed. As an example, the buffered FL approach (Fed-Buff) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> employs a K-size buffer at the server, processing client updates only after receiving K updates. A notable limitation of Fed-Buff is its inability to adapt to speed differences among heterogeneous clients. As a result, the buffer is overwhelmed by faster clients, introducing training bias.
Moreover, without considering the differences in data and computational speed among clients, the accuracy of the global model could suffer as the local models of faster clients might be less accurate. Consequently, when leveraging different methods of FL within an IIoT heterogeneous environment, it is necessary to take into account the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">tradeoffs between model convergence speed, model accuracy, and balance between clients with varying speeds</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, although FL method provides privacy preservation compared to traditional centralized methods, it is still vulnerable to privacy attacks involving model poisoning and model inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Attackers may eavesdrop on the communication channel or compromise the server to access model updates, resulting in data leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Thus, it is essential to <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">enhance the privacy of FL</span> in addition to focusing on privacy concerns in IIoT through FL. Homomorphic encryption (HE) can be used to enhance FL privacy by aggregating encrypted model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In contrast to some secure FL schemes, such as differential privacy (DP)-based FL, which introduce inevitable accuracy losses due to added noise, FL with HE preserves model accuracy while protecting data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The challenges previously highlighted motivate us to develop a Buffered FL (BFL)-based anomaly detection model for IIoT. This model effectively addresses three critical challenges from a new perspective: stragglers, communication bottlenecks, and privacy-preservation. BFL achieves this by combining synchronous and buffered FL concepts in a novel manner, despite heterogeneous client speeds. A global model in BFL is synchronously transmitted only to clients who have submitted their local parameters to the server’s buffer within a specified time. Based on the training times of each client, the specific time is calculated using a novel weighted average time method. The proposed weighted average time method is designed to ensure fairness between fast and slow clients, minimizing the straggler effects, communication bottlenecks, and training bias. Moreover, HE-based secure communication is implemented to enhance model parameter privacy. The main contributions of this work are as follows:</p>

various cyber threats to industrial CPS remote processes, including response injection attacks, command injection attacks, reconnaissance attacks, and DoS attacks. Response injection attacks involve falsified response messages to querying entities, while command injection attacks introduce false commands into the industrial control systems. Reconnaissance attacks aim to gather information about industrial CPSs, and DoS attacks overload a target system, causing disruptions in industrial CPSs.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A novel FL framework and a HE-based secure communication protocol are used to network multiple industrial CPS owners to develop a DL anomaly detection model. We use a partial HE; a type of HE that permits both the addition and multiplication of ciphertexts. The rationale behind this choice is rooted in the superior speed of partial HE compared to fully HE. It is also motivated by the fact that partial HE is,
in most cases,
sufficient for homomorphic calculations, especially for FLs that only require addition and multiplication. </p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The BFL framework employs the SFL strategy to avoid communication bottlenecks. In this manner, the updated model will not be sent individually to each industrial agent, such as AFL. A buffer-based server is also used to prevent stragglers. Thus, BFL server does not wait for all agents to send their local models before aggregating. Rather, BFL server waits until a specific time for agents to send their local models. To calculate the specific time, avoid overloading the buffer-based server, and avoid training bias, the weighted average time method is used during the first iteration of BFL. The weighted average time method determines the specific time based on the training time spent by each agent.

In the first iteration of BFL, agents receive initial parameter values from the aggregator server, they train DL-based anomaly detection models locally with their own data (line 7 of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In III-C Proposed Methodology ‣ III Methodology ‣ A Novel Buffered Federated Learning Framework for Privacy-Driven Anomaly Detection in IIoT" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).

Afterward, the encrypted parameters and training time for each agent are uploaded to the aggregator. After the aggregator server receives the training times and local encrypted parameters of the agents, encrypted global parameters and weighted average time are calculated (lines 13 and 15 of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In III-C Proposed Methodology ‣ III Methodology ‣ A Novel Buffered Federated Learning Framework for Privacy-Driven Anomaly Detection in IIoT" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Both a CNN and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were trained on two specified datasets. The CNN architecture consists of two 1D convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, one MaxPooling layer, and one AveragePooling layer. For both datasets, the first convolutional layer has 8 filters of size 3, and the second convolutional layer has 16 filters of size 3. The MaxPooling layer and AveragePooling layer, each has a kernel size of 2. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is applied in the convolutional layers, and Softmax is used for multi-class classification. The MLP architecture applied to both datasets comprises three fully connected layers. For the Gas Pipeline dataset, the first layer maps the 18-dimensional input to a 54-dimensional space, the second layer reduces this to a 20-dimensional space, and the final layer maps it to 8 classes. For the WUSTL-IIoT dataset, the first layer maps the 41-dimensional input to a 9-dimensional space, the second layer also maps this to a 9-dimensional space, and the final layer maps it to 5 classes. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was selected as the optimization function. For the Gas pipeline dataset, a batch size of 64 was used, while a batch size of 1000 was used for the WUSTL-IIoT dataset. The learning rate and momentum were set at 0.01 and 0.8, respectively. These hyperparameters were determined through trial and error, with the combination of a 0.01 learning rate and 0.8 momentum yielding the best results. Due to space constraints, we present only the results of the model trained with SGD using these optimal hyperparameters. Datasets are divided into three parts: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. The data is then normalized using the MinMaxScaler, which scales the values between 0 and 1.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a first step, we compared the efficiency of BFL based on CNN and MLP algorithms in terms of accuracy, and overall training time to determine the best algorithm to use for the next steps. In order to compare them in terms of overall training time, we take into account 5 clients (industrial agents), and the target accuracy of 94.7% for the Gas pipeline dataset and 99.8% for WUSTL-IIoT dataset. Both accuracy targets are achieved when all data is available. The accuracy of both models is also compared based on 5 clients, two iterations, 10 local epochs, 0.01 learning rate, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization for both datasets. As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B Comparison of two DL algorithms on BFL ‣ IV Experiment Setting and Evaluation ‣ A Novel Buffered Federated Learning Framework for Privacy-Driven Anomaly Detection in IIoT" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-B Comparison of two DL algorithms on BFL ‣ IV Experiment Setting and Evaluation ‣ A Novel Buffered Federated Learning Framework for Privacy-Driven Anomaly Detection in IIoT" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, MLP outperforms CNN in both datasets. The simplicity of the MLP architecture, with fewer parameters to learn, compared to CNN with more layers, such as pooling layers, allows it to converge faster to the target accuracy. Therefore, MLP is a more appropriate approach for real-time environments with tabular data. Consequently, we select MLP as the baseline algorithm for further comparisons in the next sections (<a href="#S4.SS3" title="IV-C Overall training time evaluation based on client numbers ‣ IV Experiment Setting and Evaluation ‣ A Novel Buffered Federated Learning Framework for Privacy-Driven Anomaly Detection in IIoT" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span></span></a> and <a href="#S4.SS4" title="IV-D Efficacy of communication and the Straggler effect of BFL ‣ IV Experiment Setting and Evaluation ‣ A Novel Buffered Federated Learning Framework for Privacy-Driven Anomaly Detection in IIoT" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-D</span></span></a>).</p>

This is a result of two factors. Firstly, when datasets contain specific samples, dividing the data among a greater number of clients results in each client getting a smaller portion of the overall dataset. As a result, each client must train on a smaller dataset, resulting in slower convergence. Secondly, the increase in the number of clients requires the server to communicate with more clients to produce the aggregated model, which results in the algorithm taking longer to converge to the target accuracy.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Accuracy and convergence speed allow
to evaluate FL methods’ robustness against stragglers and communication efficiency. We consider the same target accuracies that are mentioned earlier when evaluating the convergence speed of each FL method. Moreover, we compare model accuracy based on 5 clients, 10 iterations for the Gas pipeline dataset, and 4 iterations for the WUSTL-IIoT dataset. SFL and AFL have foundational implementations detailed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, respectively.
Although FedBuff’s accuracy and convergence speed increase with increasing buffer size, choosing the appropriate buffer size is its weakness. Therefore, we assume that the buffer size in FedBuff is set to half the number of clients participating in the heterogeneous environment. Accordingly, for a scenario with five clients, we consider a buffer size of two.</p>

A higher random value indicates a slower client, whereas a lower random value indicates a faster client. Additionally, to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in scenarios involving heterogeneous datasets, we assume varying data sizes for each client. This means that clients with more data will have longer training times, while those with less data will train more quickly.</p>

This is attributed to BFL’s novel weighted average time, which can more effectively engage straggling clients, resulting in better prediction results (3 clients are selected by BFL). As SFL and BFL follow the same synchronous updating strategy, they have the closest prediction performance. AFL achieved the lowest accuracy, which can be explained by the fact that AFL aggregates weights from one client at a time and does not provide an effective way to deal with stragglers. In addition, FedBuff is unable to converge faster because its buffer is rapidly filled with clients that have less data and less accuracy.</p>

The faster convergence of BFL is the result of the balance that BFL creates between fast and slow clients, avoiding to wait for the slowest client like in SFL or favor faster clients as in FedBuff. Additionally, the convergence speed result for AFL indicates that AFL methods, where the server simply communicates with all clients, suffer from a severe communication bottleneck.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel FL framework, named BFL, to detect cyber threats against industrial CPSs. BFL employs a HE-based secure communication protocol that preserves the privacy of model parameters during training. In BFL, the following modules are synthesized cohesively: (1) a buffering strategy to handle stragglers; (2) synchronous updating of the global model to prevent communication bottlenecks; (3) a novel, weighted average time method that the FL server uses to balance between fast and slow clients in a heterogeneous environment. In extensive experiments using two real industrial CPS datasets, BFL achieved the highest prediction accuracy, converged the fastest, and had superiority over state-of-the-art FL schemes. In future work, we intend to improve the weighted average time method to dynamically adapt the selection of clients at each training iteration based on the changing computation capability of clients and the fluctuating network conditions.</p>
