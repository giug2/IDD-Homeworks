<p id="id32.id1" class="ltx_p">With the tremendous success of large language models represented by ChatGPT, artificial intelligence has ushered in a new wave and entered the era of big models. Multimodal data, which can comprehensively perceive and recognize the physical world, has become an essential path towards general artificial intelligence. However, multimodal large models trained on public datasets often underperform in specific industrial domains. This paper proposes a multimodal federated learning framework that enables multiple enterprises to utilize private domain data to collaboratively train large models for vertical domains, achieving intelligent services across scenarios. The authors discuss in-depth the strategic transformation of federated learning in terms of intelligence foundation and objectives in the era of big model, as well as the new challenges faced in heterogeneous data, model aggregation, performance and cost trade-off, data privacy, and incentive mechanism. The paper elaborates a case study of leading enterprises contributing multimodal data and expert knowledge to city safety operation management , including distributed deployment and efficient coordination of the federated learning platform, technical innovations on data quality improvement based on large model capabilities and efficient joint fine-tuning approaches. Preliminary experiments show that enterprises can enhance and accumulate intelligent capabilities through multimodal model federated learning, thereby jointly creating an smart city model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy infrastructure safety, residential community security, and urban operation management. The established federated learning cooperation ecosystem is expected to further aggregate industry, academia, and research resources, realize large models in multiple vertical domains, and promote the large-scale industrial application of artificial intelligence and cutting-edge research on multimodal federated learning.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to several decades of rapid development in data, computing power, and algorithms, artificial intelligence has entered a new era of enthusiasm. Large-scale language models such as ChatGPT<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> have achieved incredible effects, particularly in understanding human intentions, context learning, and zero-shot learning for general tasks. The achievements have swiftly influenced the field of computer vision as well. Works like SAM<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and UniDetector<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> have demonstrated capabilities in open-world object recognition and segmentation. This surge in research breakthroughs and astonishing intelligent abilities has
instilled the hope of achieving universal artificial intelligence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To realize general artificial intelligence, intelligent agents need to be capable of processing and comprehending multimodal information while interacting with the real world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Multimodality has an innate advantage in information fusion to cover everything from traditional sensory recognition to complex cognitive reasoning and decision making tasks. For instance, by adding lip motion image modal data, some vague pronunciations can be accurately recognized, in the autonomous driving domain, by comprehensively utilizing sensor and camera signals, the perception of road conditions is enhanced, in the field of robot control, RGB-D and 3D point clouds, due to the introduction of depth information, have given intelligent entities a concept of ”distance” in their perception of the environment.</p>

Effectively combining diverse sources of multimodal data using cutting-edge large-scale model techniques and deeply exploring the relationships among various modalities to integrate information for intelligent emergent effects has rapidly become one of the most prominent research topics. The mainstream approaches includes fusing multimodal feature through cross-attentions such as CLIP<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>,ALBEF<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and BLIP<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and incorporating multimodal information into a powerful large language model such as OFA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, Flamingo<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, Palm-E<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> .</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the multimodal large models provided by AI giants and start-ups are based on public datasets. They could achieve high performance on the validation datasets in experimental environments and could adapt to some application scenarios requiring common sense only. However, these models often fall short of expectations in specific industrial applications. To enhance their performance, fine-tuning of these general large models with enterprise private data, alongside the integration of domain expertise, becomes essential to a successful adoption. This process enables the creation of domain-specific large models, enriching domain understanding and producing more specialized and accurate outputs. The method of fine-tuning based on large models can integrate domain knowledge on top of world knowledge. Compared with the traditional small models trained end-to-end in special domains, it has better generalization capability and can quickly adapt to open industrial application environments. This is conducive to the adoption of industrial intelligence in large amounts of application scenarios with lower cost.</p>

However, the application scenarios, proprietary data and expert knowledge of an individual company is often insufficient to cover the entire industry domain. Only through ecological cooperation, a number of companies could contribute complementary and multimodal data, as well as different aspects of expert knowledge, and thus jointly train a domain-specific large model covering as many as scenarios in the industry domain. This model can support various intelligent tasks complementing and stacking each other, and have stable and reliable performance in various practical application environments. For instance, models jointly trained by energy companies, household appliance companies, and healthcare companies can provide household customers with intelligent services for low-carbon and healthy living.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Due to data privacy and asset value concerns, companies are reluctant to share data with each other. Federated learning(FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> provides a new AI paradigm to enable companies to jointly train a model while keeping data within their local computing resources. Traditional federated learning leverages similar or relevant data from multiple companies to train a global model from scratch, for the purpose of improving higher accuracy within the specific application scenarios. In big model era, the concept and definition of federated learning should be extended and reconsidered to enable aforementioned ecological cooperation aiming at domain specific large models for industrial applications. It starts by leveraging the power of pre-trained large models using vast public datasets as the intelligence foundation, and jointly fine-tuning the foundation model using multimodal data from various companies. The multimodal large model generated by federated learning not only has the intelligence capabilities of each participant, but also integrates and fuses their intelligence. As a result, it enables all-encompassing intelligent capabilities across industrial scenarios and expanding the intelligent application boundaries for individual participants.

Federated learning participants have private data of different modalities. The client can use various methods to implement heterogeneous models, such as using the LoRA method to train a small amount of network parameters for the model, training only a specific expert module (MOE), transferring feature maps through knowledge distillation, or training bridge networks for different modal encoders.The server fuses the heterogeneous models from other participants using a flexible model aggregation method and distributes the fused model for iterative training. With the help of the fused model’s capability, the data quality of the participants is continuously improved. This forms a positive feedback loop of data and model performance. In this way, we obtain a large-scale pre-trained model for a specific domain. This model can support multiple downstream intelligent tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, image classification, image generation, etc.</p>

The textual representations learned from large-scale web data can serve as the targets for learning different modalities features, and the federated partners are selected to maximize the diversity of data, which improves the coverage ratio in the label space, and aligns other modalities such as images, sounds, and videos with the textual modality as the “mediator”.</p>

To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of training, the clients can use the pre-trained image encoder and text encoder weights to map images and texts to a better semantic space. Then, an additional bridge network is added, which is responsible for aligning the image and text spaces. Multiple participants jointly train the bridge network to achieve faster modality alignment and represent domain specific knowledge.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the crucial factors for developing effective multimodal large models in the industrial internet domain is the availability and quality of multimodal data. Increasing the size of the dataset and including more comprehensive and varied samples from different modalities can enhance the performance of multimodal large models. However, in the industrial internet domain, data from different industries and modalities are distributed among different enterprises, and they cannot be aggregated and processed due to confidentiality and other constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a cross-enterprise data cleaning method that utilizes the power of large models and federated learning technology,as illustrated in Fig <a href="#S2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ II-C Data Quality Improvement ‣ II Federated Learning Framework for Domain-Specific Multimodal Large Models ‣ Federated Learning in Big Model Era: Domain-Specific Multimodal Large Models Identify applicable funding agency here.

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Urban operation management requires a holistic solution, based on various data sources (e.g., surveillance video and inspection photo) and knowledge (e.g., reports and regulations) from different companies and government agencies. Therefore, a domain-specific multimodal large model is desired to inspect safety hazardous in any corner of the city regarding to infrastructure and human behaviours. This comprehensive large model helps to improve the urban safety and efficiency. By integrating visual, textual, auditory, and other modality data, the model can perform real-time monitoring and early warning, and thus help the urban management departments to quickly respond and handle various incidents, ensuring the safety of residents’ lives and property. In addition, it is also very helpful for city management and planners to improve facility layout and resource scheduling for energy saving, as well as living convenience and quality.</p>

<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As urban operation management is a complex and dynamic process, various data sources and domain expertise are required to train a multimodal large model covering the entire application scenarios. To solve this problem, ENN Group, WiNDAKA, and UNICOM(Shanghai) have collaborated to establish a collaborative ecosystem.

They have accumulated large amounts of data over the years to support a vision-language large model training for urban operation and management vertical domain. The multi-party collaboration is essential for covering smart city intelligence tasks. The parties share and integrate complementary data and knowledge, forming a data aggregation effect, thereby establishing a more comprehensive and accurate multimodal large model.</p>

We adopt a model self-iteration data augmentation scheme, where data and model mutually promote each other, and generate more realistic and comprehensive image captions.For Case A where there is a lot of noise such as address information and sensitive information in the data, we need to perform data cleaning based on the rules. For data with only images and corresponding object labels, we need to use LLM to assist in generating some descriptive text by using prompts.For data with text-image pairs, but the text descriptions are too short to cover the complete scene, we need to add some custom rules to perform text expansion. In different scenarios, multimodal models are first trained locally, and a federated multimodal large model is formed through federated learning, which aggregates data and knowledge from multiple parties. The original local data can be filtered and augmented using a filter-based approach to improve data quality. At the same time, high-quality data can be generated through expert annotation feedback.

However, federated learning not only enhances the original intelligence capabilities of the parties, but also has the intelligence capabilities of other parties, and through powerful inference capabilities, superimposes and integrates the intelligence capabilities of each party to achieve a higher level of intelligence. Obviously, it is unreasonable to compare the results generated by federated learning with the ground truth of a party’s limited knowledge. Therefore, it is necessary to form a validation set of large models in vertical domains and re-annotate them in a joint intelligence manner. Since this evaluation method requires re-annotation of the existing validation set, it requires manpower to annotate, which is time-consuming and laborious. Currently, subjective evaluation methods or GPT4 are used to score, and a certain number of validation images are selected to evaluate whether the multimodal large model generated by federated learning has produced joint intelligence.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The evolution of large AI models like ChatGPT highlights the importance of multimodal data for advancing general AI. However, most existing general multimodal large models were trained public datasets and their performance in specific industrial domains are under expectations. In this paper, we have proposed a federated learning framework in big model era, supporting companies to fine-tune a general multimodal model using their proprietary data and knowledge in a collaborative and efficient manner. The framework has been deployed in companies from energy infrastructure, residential community property management and city operation management. The preliminary experimental results has shown that the vision-language large model could learn from diverse and heterogeneous data from companies and integrate their expert knowledge for understanding images better from multiple perspectives. This is essential for establishing a holistic solution to urban operation and management, inspiring novel business model for safety, energy saving, environment-friendly high-quality city living. As the federated learning ecosystem grows, it promises to accelerate collaborative intelligence for industry domain-specific large models and bring researchers together to tackle the challenges of federated learning in big model era, in terms of novel approaches to fuse heterogeneous data and model, ensuring data privacy and security based on the understanding of large models, enhance training efficiency using creative fine-tuning and model aggregation methods, incentive mechanism and IP protection methods for sustainable ecosystem collaboration, and etc.</p>
