<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaborate on building a machine learning model without sharing their private data. Although FL is considered privacy-preserved by design, recent data reconstruction attacks demonstrate that an attacker can recover clients’ training data based on the parameters shared in FL. However, most existing methods fail to attack the most widely used horizontal Federated Averaging (FedAvg) scenario, where clients share model parameters after multiple local training steps. To tackle this issue, we propose an interpolation-based approximation method, which makes attacking FedAvg scenarios feasible by generating the intermediate model updates of the clients’ local training processes. Then, we design a layer-wise weighted loss function to improve the data quality of reconstruction. We assign different weights to model updates in different layers concerning the neural network structure, with the weights tuned by Bayesian optimization. Finally, experimental results validate the superiority of our proposed approximate and weighted attack (AWA) method over the other state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by the substantial improvement in different evaluation metrics for image data reconstructions.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing volume of data generated by distributed personal electronic devices and organizations, traditional centralized approaches for training machine learning models face challenges in terms of data collection, privacy concerns, and scalability. To address them, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2023communicationefficient </a></cite> has emerged as a promising paradigm and has gained significant attention in recent years.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One prominent feature of FL is its ability to facilitate model training on distributed data sources owned by individual clients while keeping the data localized and exchanging only model updates. For example, in the most commonly used Federated Averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2023communicationefficient </a></cite> algorithm, each client trains its local model with its private data and shares the updated model parameters to a server, where the model parameters are aggregated and used to update the global model. In other words, FL enables multiple participants to build a common and robust machine learning model without sharing data, thus addressing critical issues such as data privacy, data security, and data access rights. FL has gained significant attention in recent years to handle the growing amount of data and the increasing concerns about privacy in a number of applications, such as healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">brisimi2018federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu2021federated </a></cite>, and learning a controller model across several autonomous vehicles without sharing their history trajectories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">zeng2022federated </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although it was widely believed that model updates in FL are safe to share, recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">geng2023improved </a>; <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu2022agic </a>; <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021see </a>; <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhu2019deep </a></cite> have shown that clients’ sensitive training data can be compromised through <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data reconstruction attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhu2019deep </a></cite>. In these attacks, the adversary randomly initializes dummy samples and labels, and executes forward and backward propagation to obtain dummy model updates. Through an iterative process of minimizing the discrepancy between the dummy model updates and the shared ones, the dummy samples and labels are updated simultaneously. In the literature, some work has already been done for improving the reconstruction performance, we refer to the label inference techniques in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021see </a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhao2020idlg </a></cite>, the new distance functions and optimizers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">geiping2020inverting </a>; <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2020sapag </a></cite>, and the regularization methods in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">geiping2020inverting </a>; <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">jeon2021gradient </a>; <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">wei2020framework </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">By inferring labels in advance, the joint optimization of both samples and labels can be avoided, thus reducing the complexity of the optimization problem. It was first discovered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhao2020idlg </a></cite> that the label information of a single sample can be analytically extracted based on the model updates of the last fully connected layer. Later, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021see </a></cite> extended the single sample label extraction to batch samples, under the limiting assumption of non-repeating labels in the batch. The above limitation is further addressed by the batch label inference approach proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">geng2023improved </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To measure the discrepancy between the dummy and shared gradients, the Euclidean distance is commonly used in the loss function for the attack, see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021see </a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhao2020idlg </a>; <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhu2019deep </a></cite>. Moreover, the angle-based cosine similarity was suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">geiping2020inverting </a>; <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu2022agic </a></cite> since the high-dimensional direction of the gradients carries more information than the magnitude. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2020sapag </a></cite>, a Gaussian kernel of gradients differences was proposed to measure the discrepancy, allowing the scaling factor in the kernel to be adapted to the distribution of gradients in each attack.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">As for the optimizers employed in the attacks, the L-BFGS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu1989limited </a></cite> and the Adam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">kingma2017adam </a></cite> are the most commonly used ones, see e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">geiping2020inverting </a>; <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">jeon2021gradient </a>; <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2020sapag </a>; <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">wei2020framework </a>; <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021see </a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhao2020idlg </a>; <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhu2019deep </a></cite>. In particular, the reconstruction performance of the above two optimizers was compared in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">geiping2020inverting </a>; <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2020sapag </a>; <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">wei2020framework </a></cite>. It has been shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">wei2020framework </a></cite> that the L-BFGS requires fewer attack iterations to achieve high reconstruction quality compared to the Adam when attacking the LFW dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">huang2008labeled </a></cite>. On the other hand, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">geiping2020inverting </a></cite>, the L-BFGS performs worse than the Adam for the CIFAR-10 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">krizhevsky2009learning </a></cite>. Although there is no definitive analysis guiding the selection of cost functions and optimizers, it is evident that appropriate choices can enhance the effectiveness of attacks in specific scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Another important way to improve the reconstruction performance is to add auxiliary regularization terms to the loss function for the attack based on some prior knowledge of the data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">wei2020framework </a></cite>, a label regularizer was proposed to match the dummy samples and labels when both of them are optimized simultaneously. Moreover, some image prior information can be employed for image reconstruction attacks, such as the total variation regularization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">geiping2020inverting </a></cite> to reduce the noise in images, and the group registration regularization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021see </a></cite> to center the position of the main object in images. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021see </a></cite>, a prior term is proposed by using the values of the mean and variance of a batch of samples in batch normalization layers. A generative model pre-trained on the raw data distribution was used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">jeon2021gradient </a></cite> to improve the reconstruction. However, in most distributed learning systems, batch normalization information and raw data distribution are not necessarily shared, which makes these methods less practical.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Despite remarkable progress, limited attention has been paid to attacking the FedAvg with multiple-step model updates, where clients share accumulated local model parameters after training for multiple epochs, each executed over multiple mini-batches. In this regard, an approximate and weighted method, named AGIC, is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">xu2022agic </a></cite>. The AGIC method employs a weighted cosine similarity loss function by assigning linearly increasing weights to different convolutional and fully connected layers. This method assumes that a combined batch consisting of all the mini-batches used in the client’s local training process can approximate the received model update in a single local update step. However, such an approximation method works only for scenarios with small local learning rates. Moreover, the weights are chosen empirically rather than systematically.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above issues, we propose a novel approximate and weighted data reconstruction attack method against FL systems utilizing FedAvg algorithms. First, we present an interpolation-based approximation method that generates intermediate model updates of clients’ local training processes. As a result, attacking against the FedAvg with multiple-step model updates becomes feasible. Then, we propose a layer-wise weighted loss function to enhance the reconstruction quality. Different weights are assigned to model updates in each layer based on the neural network structure. The selection of the weights is optimized using the Bayesian optimization method.</p>

To fix ideas, we focus on the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2023communicationefficient </a></cite>, which is the most commonly used algorithm in FL. The FedAvg presented in <a href="#alg1" title="In 2.2 FedAvg Algorithm ‣ 2 Preliminaries ‣ Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Algorithm</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> involves a series of global rounds, in which the server first dispatches the latest global model parameters to a group of selected clients. Then, the selected clients compute model updates to the current global model with their private data and send the updated model parameters back to the server. Finally, the server aggregates the received model parameters to update the global model parameters, which serves as the initializer for the next round.</p>

However, as observed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2019shallowing </a></cite>, different layers in a neural network provide different contributions to boosting the performance. Inspired by this fact, we propose to assign different weights to the model updates in different layers to facilitate the reconstruction. The implementation of our method is elaborated in this section.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate the efficiency of the attach and the quality of the data reconstruction, we use three different metrics to measure the dissimilarity between reconstructed data and the real data: pixel-wise Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">sara2019image </a></cite>, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang2004imagea </a></cite>.
The above three metrics are prevalent and appropriate indicators in evaluating the effect of image reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">sara2019image </a></cite>, and they have been widely used in evaluating the existing data reconstruction attacks, see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">geiping2020inverting </a>; <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">wei2020framework </a>; <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021see </a></cite>.</p>

We observe that in all four cases, our proposed AWA method consistently yields images with substantially enhanced resolution compared to those obtained by DLG and AGIC. This is further validated by the consistently highest values of PSNR and SSIM achieved by AWA in each case. Another noteworthy finding is the consistency in the reconstruction qualities of images produced by our AWA method across the diverse FedAvg cases, which demonstrates the robustness of our proposed approach.</p>

On the other hand, although AGIC incorporates an approximate strategy, it fails to reconstruct images with identifiable objects effectively. In sharp contrast, the proposed AWA method demonstrates its capability to successfully reconstruct images with reasonable resolutions, overcoming the limitations faced by DLG and AGIC. Furthermore, the PSNR of images reconstructed in Case 4 is found to be comparable to that achieved in the first three cases, which strongly suggests the effectiveness of our proposed approximate strategy.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we implement the AWA method with 3000 iterations for four cases. All the other parameters maintain consistency with the original experiment setup.

It is evident that our method achieves a satisfactory level of reconstruction, with SSIM values exceeding 0.9 within 1500 attack iterations for all four cases. The outcomes of Case 4 exhibit a marginally inferior performance compared to Cases 1-3 due to the need of approximation. However, the reconstructed images in Case 4 remain sufficiently lucid to facilitate object identification. These results further validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed AWA method.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a contemporary paradigm for safe distributed learning, its potential privacy benefits are compromised by data reconstruction attacks. In this paper, we first formulate the attack as an inverse problem (<a href="#S2.E8" title="Equation 8 ‣ 2.3 Data Reconstruction Attack ‣ 2 Preliminaries ‣ Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>), allowing us to reconstruct the client’s training data iteratively by solving an optimization problem (<a href="#S2.E11" title="Equation 11 ‣ 2.3 Data Reconstruction Attack ‣ 2 Preliminaries ‣ Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>). To attack the widely used FedAvg scenario, we propose an interpolation-based approximation method (<a href="#S4.E20" title="Equation 20 ‣ 4.1 Approximation of the intermediate model update {Δ⁢𝜃_{𝑡,𝑒}}_{𝑒=1}^𝐸 when 𝐸&gt;1 and 𝐵&gt;1 ‣ 4 Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Method ‣ Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">20</span></a>), where the intermediate model updates corresponding to each epoch are approximated by interpolating the model parameters. Furthermore, we propose a layer-wise weighted and enhanced loss function (<a href="#S4.E23" title="Equation 23 ‣ 4.2 Improved Weighted Loss Function for the Data Reconstruction Attack ‣ 4 Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Method ‣ Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">23</span></a>) for the attack to improve the quality of reconstructed data. By assigning appropriate weights to model updates in different layers solving (<a href="#S4.E34" title="Equation 34 ‣ Objective function. ‣ 4.2.2 Choice of 𝑄 by Bayesian Optimization ‣ 4.2 Improved Weighted Loss Function for the Data Reconstruction Attack ‣ 4 Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Method ‣ Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Attack in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">34</span></a>), using the Bayesian optimization method, we achieve superior reconstruction results compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our method is compatible with various neural network architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks and Residual Neural Networks. Numerical results validate that our proposed approximate and weighted data reconstruction attack method is effective for adversaries to exploit the vulnerabilities of FL systems utilizing Federated Averaging algorithms. The ability to reconstruct data from intermediate model updates highlights the need for robust defense mechanisms. Future research could focus on developing countermeasures and enhancing the security of FL frameworks to mitigate the risks associated with such attacks.</p>
