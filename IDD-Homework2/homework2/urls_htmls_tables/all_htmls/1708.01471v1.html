<p id="id16.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual question answering (VQA) is challenging because it requires a simultaneous understanding of both the visual content of images and the textual content of questions. The approaches used to represent the images and questions in a fine-grained manner and questions and to fuse these multi-modal features play key roles in performance. Bilinear pooling based models have been shown to outperform traditional linear models for VQA, but their high-dimensional representations and high computational complexity may seriously limit their applicability in practice. For multi-modal feature fusion, here we develop a Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling approach to efficiently and effectively combine multi-modal features, which results in superior performance for VQA compared with other bilinear pooling approaches. For fine-grained image and question representation, we develop a ‘co-attention’ mechanism using an end-to-end deep network architecture to jointly learn both the image and question attentions. Combining the proposed MFB approach with co-attention learning in a new network architecture provides a unified model for VQA. Our experimental results demonstrate that the single MFB with co-attention model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the real-world VQA dataset.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to recent advances in computer vision and natural language processing, computers are expected to be able to automatically understand the semantics of images and natural languages in the near future. Such advances have also stimulated new research topics like image-text retrieval <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, image captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, and visual question answering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with image-text retrieval and image captioning (which just require the underlying algorithms to search or generate a free-form text description for a given image), <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">visual question answering</em> (VQA) is a more challenging task that requires fine-grained understanding of the semantics of both the images and the questions as well as supports complex reasoning to predict the best-matching answer correctly. In some aspects, the VQA task can be treated as a generalization of image captioning and image-text retrieval. Thus building effective VQA algorithms, which can achieve close performance like human beings, is an important step towards enabling artificial intelligence in general.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Existing VQA approaches usually have three stages: (1) representing the images as visual features and questions as textual features; (2) combining these multi-modal features to obtain fused image-question features; (3) using the integrated image-question features to learn a multi-class classifier and to predict the best-matching answer. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective and flexible, many existing approaches model the three stages in one DNN model and train the model in an end-to-end fashion through back-propagation. In the three stages, feature representation and multi-modal feature fusion particular affect VQA performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">With respect to multi-modal feature fusion, most existing approaches simply use linear models for multi-modal feature fusion (e.g., concatenation or element-wise addition) to integrate the image’s visual feature with the question’s textual feature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Since multi-modal feature distributions may vary dramatically, the integrated image-question representations obtained by such linear models may not be sufficiently expressive to fully capture complex associations between the visual features from images and the textual features from questions. In contrast to linear pooling, bilinear pooling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> has recently been used to integrate different CNN features for fine-grained image recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, the high dimensionality of the output features and the huge number of model parameters may seriously limit the applicability of bilinear pooling. Fukui <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed the Multi-modal Compact Bilinear (MCB) pooling model to effectively and simultaneously reduce the number of parameters and computation time using the Tensor Sketch algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Using the MCB model, the group proposed a network architecture for the VQA task and won the VQA challenge 2016. Nevertheless, the MCB model lies on a high-dimensional output feature to guarantee robust performance, which may limit its applicability due to huge memory usage. To overcome this problem, Kim <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed the Multi-modal Low-rank Bilinear (MLB) pooling model based on the Hadamard product of two feature vectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Since MLB generate output features with lower dimensions and models with fewer parameters, it is highly competitive with MCB. However, MLB has a slow convergence rate and is sensitive to the learned hyper-parameters. To address these issues, here we develop the Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear pooling (MFB) method, which enjoys the dual benefits of compact output features of MLB and robust expressive capacity of MCB.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">With respect to feature representation, directly using global features for image representation may introduce noisy information that is irrelevant to the given question. Therefore, it is intuitive to introduce <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">visual attention</em> mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> into the VQA task to adaptively learn the most relevant image regions for a given question. Modeling visual attention may significantly improve performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, most existing approaches only model image attention without considering question attention, even though question attention is also very important since the questions interpreted in natural languages may also contain colloquialisms that can be regarded as noise. Therefore, based on our MFB approach, we design a deep network architecture for the VQA task using a <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">co-attention learning</em> module to jointly learn both image and question attentions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To summarize, the main contributions of this study are as follows: First, we develop a simple but effective Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear pooling (MFB) approach to fuse the visual features from images with the textual features from questions. MFB significantly outperforms existing multi-modal bilinear pooling approaches such as MCB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and MLB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Second, based on the MFB module, a <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">co-attention</em> learning architecture is designed to jointly learn both image and question attention. Our MFB approach with co-attention model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the VQA dataset. We also conduct detailed and extensive experiments to show why our MFB approach is effective. Our experimental results demonstrate that normalization techniques are extremely important in bilinear models.</p>

Since then, solving the VQA task has received increasing attention from the computer vision and natural language processing communities. VQA approaches can be classified into the following methodological categories: the coarse joint-embedding models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the fine-grained joint-embedding models with attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and the external knowledge based models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The coarse joint-embedding models are the most straightforward VQA solutions. Image and question are first represented as global features and then integrated to predict the answer. Zhou <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a baseline approach for the VQA task by using the concatenation of the image CNN features and the question BoW (bag-of-words) features, with a linear classifier learned to predict the answer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Some approaches introduce more complex deep models, e.g., LSTM networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> or residual networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, to tackle the VQA task in an end-to-end fashion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One limitation of coarse joint-embedding models is that their global features may contain noisy information, making it hard to correctly answer fine-grained problems (e.g., “what color are the cat’s eyes?”) . Therefore, recent VQA approaches introduce the <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">visual attention</em> mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> into the VQA task by adaptively learning the local fine-grained image features for a given question. Chen <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a “question-guided attention map” that projects the question embeddings to the visual space and formulates a configurable convolutional kernel to search the image attention region <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Yang <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a stacked attention network to learn the attention iteratively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Some approaches introduce off-the-shelf object detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or object proposals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> as the attention region candidates and then use the question to identify related ones. Fukui <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed multi-modal compact bilinear pooling to integrate image features from spatial grids with textual features from the questions to predict the attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In addition, some approaches apply attention learning to both the images and questions. Lu <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a co-attention learning framework to alternately learn the image attention and the question attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Nam <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a multi-stage co-attention learning framework to refine the attentions based on memory of previous attentions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite joint embedding models for VQA delivering impressive performance, they are not good enough for answering problems that require complex reasoning or common sense knowledge.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-modal feature fusion plays an important and fundamental role in VQA. After the image and question features are obtained, concatenation or element-wise summations are most frequently used for multi-modal feature fusion. Since the distributions of two feature sets in different modalities (i.e.,the visual features from images and the textual features from questions) may vary significantly, the representation capacity of the fused features may be insufficient, limiting the final prediction performance.</p>

In contrast to the aforementioned approaches, they proposed the Multi-modal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), which uses the outer product of two feature vectors to produce a very high-dimensional feature for quadratic expansion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. To reduce the computational cost, they used a sampling-based approximation approach that exploits the property that the projection of two vectors can be represented as their convolution. The MCB model outperformed the simple fusion approaches and demonstrated superior performance on the VQA dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, MCB usually needs high-dimensional features (e.g., 16,000-D) to guarantee robust performance, which may seriously limit its applicability due to limitations in GPU memory.</p>

The approach can be easily implemented by combining some commonly-used layers such as fully-connected, element-wise multiplication and pooling layers. Furthermore, to prevent over-fitting, a dropout layer is added after the element-wise multiplication layer.

In this section, two network architectures are introduced. The first is the MFB baseline with one MFB module, which is used to perform ablation analysis with different hyper-parameters for comparison with other baseline approaches. The second network introduces co-attention learning which jointly learns the image and question attentions, to better capture fine-grained correlations between the image and the question, which may lead to a model with better representation capability.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the results reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, one can see that incorporating an attention mechanism allows the model to effectively learn which region is important for the question, clearly contributing to better performance than the model without attention. However, the attention model in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> only focuses on learning image attention while completely ignoring question attention. Since the questions are interpreted as natural language, the contribution of each word is significantly different. Therefore, here we develop a co-attention learning approach (see Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Network Architectures for VQA ‣ Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling with Co-Attention Learning for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) to jointly learn both the question and image attentions.</p>

Different to other co-attention models for VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, in our model, the image and question modules are loosely coupled such that we do not exploit the image features when learning the question attention module. This is because we assume that the network can directly infer the question attention (i.e., the key words of the question) without seeing the image, as humans do. We name this network MFB with Co-Attention (MFB+CoAtt).</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To better demonstrate the effects of co-attention learning, in Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.4 Comparison with State-of-the-art ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling with Co-Attention Learning for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> we visualize the learned question and image attentions of some examples from the validation set. The examples are randomly picked from different question types. It can be seen that the learned question and image attentions are usually closely focus on the key words and the most relevant image regions. From the incorrect examples, we can also draw conclusions about the weakness of our approach, which are perhaps common to all VQA approaches: 1) some key words in the question are neglected by the question attention module, which seriously affects the learned image attention and final predictions (e.g., the word <em id="S5.SS4.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">catcher</em> in the first example and the word <em id="S5.SS4.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">bottom</em> in the third example); 2) even the intention of the question is well understood, some visual contents are still unrecognized (e.g., the <em id="S5.SS4.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">flags</em> in the second example) or misclassified (the <em id="S5.SS4.p7.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">meat</em> in the fourth example), leading to the wrong answer for the counting problem. These observations are useful to guide further improvements for VQA in the future.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we develop a Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear pooling (MFB) approach to fuse multi-modal features for the VQA task. Compared with existing bilinear pooling methods, the MFB approach achieves significant performance improvement for the VQA task. Based on MFB, we design a network architecture with co-attention learning that achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the real-world VQA dataset. This explorations of multi-modal bilinear pooling and co-attention learning are applicable to a wide range of tasks involving multi-modal data.</p>
