<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">The large population of wireless users is a key driver of data-crowdsourced Machine Learning (ML). However, data privacy remains a significant concern. Federated Learning (FL) encourages data sharing in ML without requiring data to leave users’ devices but imposes heavy computation and communications overheads on mobile devices. Hierarchical FL (HFL) alleviates this problem by performing partial model aggregation at edge servers. HFL can effectively reduce energy consumption and latency through effective resource allocation and appropriate user assignment. Nevertheless, resource allocation in HFL involves optimizing multiple variables, and the objective function should consider both energy consumption and latency, making the development of resource allocation algorithms very complicated. Moreover, it is challenging to perform user assignment, which is a combinatorial optimization problem in a large search space. This article proposes a spectrum resource optimization algorithm (SROA) and a two-stage iterative algorithm (TSIA) for HFL. Given an arbitrary user assignment pattern, SROA optimizes CPU frequency, transmit power, and bandwidth to minimize system cost. TSIA aims to find a user assignment pattern that considerably reduces the total system cost. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HFL framework over existing studies in energy and latency reduction.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) has been widely used in a variety of areas such as image classification, natural language processing, and autonomous control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. ML usually requires a massive amount of training data to achieve satisfactory model performance. In recent years, data crowdsourcing has emerged as an important paradigm for acquiring training data needed by ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In particular, mobile application service providers have been deploying innovative reward schemes to incentivize mobile users to participate in data crowdsourcing. As part of the efforts to develop smart cities and promote the digital economy, many government agencies are also adopting data crowdsourcing to acquire data to fuel ML. Given the pervasive adoption of smart mobile devices, the large population of wireless mobile users plays a key role in data-crowdsourced ML. In the most straightforward manner, all participating mobile users transmit their crowdsourced data to some cloud server for centralized training, which is bottlenecked by limited bandwidth resources and privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, there are major concerns of the users that need to be addressed to gain people’s trust and remove the hurdles in supporting data crowdsourcing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. These issues include cybersecurity of the central server, data privacy of the users and resource consumption on their mobile devices. In particular, battery and bandwidth consumption are of particular concern to most mobile users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the problems of centralized training, a decentralized ML framework called Federated Learning (FL) is widely adopted as an approach for encouraging data sharing in ML without requiring data to leave the devices of the participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In FL, mobile users train the local model on their datasets, and the model weights are transmitted to a remote server for model aggregation. Compared with centralized training, FL provides better protection against privacy leakage as the training data are kept on mobile users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. While enhancing data privacy, however, FL requires a non-trivial amount of computation to be performed on the mobile device, hence inevitably leading to high energy consumption and depleting device batteries rapidly. Besides, uploading local models to the aggregation server consumes valuable wireless bandwidth. In addition, due to the bandwidth issues, FL needs to be designed carefully to scale up the size of data crowdsourcing, which will directly impact the model performance. FL relying on a single server for model aggregation tends to cause network congestion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the deployment architecture of FL was extended to address multi-server scenarios. The novel FL framework, namely Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL), consists of several edge servers and one cloud server. Mobile users in HFL train the models locally and then send their model weights to the corresponding edge servers for edge aggregation. After several edge iterations, the edge servers transmit the edge models to the cloud for global aggregation. HFL has great potential in alleviating communication overheads. More importantly, the cybersecurity protection of HFL can be implemented more flexibly, thus reducing the impact on accuracy and computations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the advantages, some issues of HFL have not been fully investigated yet. For example, the communication and computation resources should be properly allocated to mobile users. As mobile users will inevitably consume higher energy if pursuing a lower time delay, it is crucial for resource allocation to balance the tradeoff between the time delay and energy consumption. In addition, resource allocation is anticipated to jointly optimize both local resources (e.g., CPU frequency and transmit power of mobile users) and system resources (e.g., network bandwidth), as these resources have a significant impact on the energy consumption and latency of the HFL system. As a result, designing an efficient resource allocation algorithm for HFL is difficult due to its complex objective and the presence of multiple variables to be jointly optimized. Besides performing resource allocation, each mobile user will be allocated to an edge server before training. Without a feasible user assignment algorithm, some edge servers may experience prolonged latency during edge updates caused by straggling mobile users. As the cloud server conducts global aggregation only when receiving the model weights from all the edge servers, the straggling mobile users will finally deteriorate the overall latency of HFL. Moreover, if the straggling mobile users increase computation frequency to reduce the computational latency, the energy consumption to perform local update will notably rise. Therefore, user assignment plays a crucial role in reducing the energy consumption and latency of HFL. Whereas, it is hard to directly solve the user assignment problem since it is a combinatorial optimization problem with a large search space. Thus, how to carry out user assignment is another challenge of deploying HFL.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">We compare the proposed SROA with several state-of-art baselines. Although SROA is primarily designed for FDMA systems, its applicability can be readily extended to alternative communication schemes such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). Therefore, we assess the performance of SROA in both FDMA and OFDMA scenarios. For the baselines in the FDMA scheme, JDSRA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> is used for comparison. For the baselines in the OFDMA scheme, ERA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and the resource allocation method in JUARA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> are used as the baseline methods. In addition, FEDL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and the resource allocation method in HFEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> can be applied for both FDMA scheme and OFDMA scheme.

This outcome can be attributed to the comprehensive nature of SROA, which considers multiple factors such as time delay and energy consumption, and optimizes the allocation of bandwidth, CPU frequency, and average transmit power in a joint manner. In contrast, existing baselines either optimize fewer parameters or considers only one perspective (either energy consumption or time delay).

The above two figures indicate the index of the edge server that transfers and receives the mobile user. The two figures below show the index of the transferred user. Take (a) as an example. At the 0-th iteration, mobile user 27 is transferred from edge server 2 to edge server 1. After the 12-th iteration, mobile user 40 is repeatedly transferred between edge server 0 and edge server 2. In this case, the first stage of TSIA uses 13 iterations to reach convergence.</figcaption>

We compare the performance of TSIA with two baseline methods, namely HFEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and JUARA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. HFEL adopts a random generation approach for the initial user assignment pattern and utilizes device transferring adjustment and device exchanging adjustment techniques. As HFEL requires a long execution time to reach convergence, we set the numbers of device transferring adjustment and device exchanging adjustment iterations to 100 and 300, respectively. JUARA addresses the user assignment problem by leveraging Lagrangian relaxation and derives the user assignment pattern using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, given a large enough time delay. Next, JUARA iteratively reduces the time delay value by a fixed step until it becomes smaller than the lower bound of the time delay. In our experiments, the total number of assigning iterations for JUARA is set to 100, with the step length adjusted accordingly. For both TSIA and HFEL, we assign an importance weight of <math id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda=1" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml">λ</mi><mo id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1b"><apply id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.2">𝜆</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p1.5.m5.1c">\lambda=1</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

This improvement is attributed to TSIA’s ability to transfer users from costly servers to economic servers, thereby achieving a balanced workload distribution. In contrast, HFEL relies on random adjustments, making it challenging to achieve an optimal assignment pattern, particularly in large search spaces. For the OFDMA scheme, TSIA outperforms JUARA in terms of both time delay and energy consumption. JUARA does not optimize the CPU frequency and average transmit power of mobile users, and it also fails to consider the energy consumption associated with training or transmitting HFL models. Therefore, TSIA proves advantageous by considering these factors and achieving superior results in terms of minimizing time delay and energy consumption.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has been proposed to address privacy concerns and relieve network congestion in FL. In this paper, we have studied the mechanism of HFL over wireless networks and investigated the user assignment problem in HFL. We formulated a user assignment problem to minimize the weights sum of the latency and energy consumption of HFL. To solve this problem, we proposed a two-stage iterative algorithm (TSIA) to handle the user assignment problem. TSIA iteratively transfers the mobile users from the straggler server to other servers, thus alleviating the communication and computation overheads of all the edge servers. As user assignment couples with the resource allocation problem, we proposed a spectrum resource optimization algorithm (SROA) to jointly optimize users’ bandwidth, CPU frequency, and average transmit power within a single edge server. The experimental results showed that SROA outperforms other benchmarks in minimizing energy consumption and time delay of HFL. Besides, TSIA enables HFL to significantly reduce global costs with a faster convergence speed. Finally, compared with traditional FL, HFL achieves a lower global cost while ensuring learning performance.</p>
