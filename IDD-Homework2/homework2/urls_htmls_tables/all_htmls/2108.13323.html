<p id="id19.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is widely used to learn intelligent models from decentralized data.
In federated learning, clients need to communicate their local model updates in each iteration of model learning.
However, model updates are large in size if the model contains numerous parameters, and there usually needs many rounds of communication until model converges.
Thus, the communication cost in federated learning can be quite heavy.
In this paper, we propose a communication efficient federated learning method based on knowledge distillation.
Instead of directly communicating the large models between clients and server, we propose an adaptive mutual distillation framework to reciprocally learn a student and a teacher model on each client, where only the student model is shared by different clients and updated collaboratively to reduce the communication cost.
Both the teacher and student on each client are learned on its local data and the knowledge distilled from each other, where their distillation intensities are controlled by their prediction quality.
To further reduce the communication cost, we propose a dynamic gradient approximation method based on singular value decomposition to approximate the exchanged gradients with dynamic precision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets in different tasks show that our approach can effectively reduce the communication cost and achieve competitive results.</p>

Each client keeps a local model and computes the model updates from its local data.
In each iteration, the model updates from a number of clients are uploaded to a server, which aggregates the local model updates into a global one to update its maintained global model.
Then, the server distributes the global update to each client to conduct a local model update.
This process is iteratively executed for many rounds until the model converges.
In this framework, the server and clients need to intensively communicate the model updates.
However, the communication cost is enormous if the model is in large size, which hinders the applications of many powerful but large-scale models like BERT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Devlin et al.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a communication efficient federated learning method based on knowledge distillation (<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span>).
Instead of directly communicating the large models between the clients and server, in <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> a small student model and a large teacher model are distilled from each other, where only the student model is shared by different clients and learned collaboratively, which can effectively reduce the communication cost.
More specifically, each client maintains a large local teacher model and a local copy of a small student model that is shared among different clients.
We propose an adaptive knowledge distillation method to enable the local teacher and student to learn from both the local data on its client and the knowledge distilled from each other, where their distillation intensities are controlled by the correctness of their predictions.
The local teacher model on each client is locally updated, while the local updates of the student models from different clients are uploaded to a central server, which aggregates these local updates into a global one.
The server further distributes the global update to different clients to update their local student models.
This process is iteratively executed until the student model converges.
In addition, to further reduce the communication cost when exchanging the student model updates, we propose a dynamic gradient approximation method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to compress the communicated gradients with dynamic precision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for different tasks validate that our approach can effectively reduce communication costs in federated learning and meanwhile achieve competitive performance.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is a privacy-aware technique to learn intelligent models from decentralized data storage, where the raw user data never leaves where it is stored.
It has been widely used in many applications like intelligent keyboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hard et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, personalized recommendation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lin et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
In federated learning, there are usually a number of user devices that locally keep the privacy-sensitive user data, and a server that coordinates these user devices for collaborative model learning.
Each user device contains a local model copy and computes the model update based on the local data.
The model updates from a certain number of user devices are uploaded to the server, which aggregates the local updates into a global one for updating its maintained global model.
The updated global model is further distributed to user devices to update their local model copies.
This process will be repeated until the model is fully trained.
Since the model updates usually contain much less private information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, federated learning can exploit decentralized data for model learning and significantly reduce privacy and security risks. However, since model updates are communicated between the server and user clients for many rounds, the communication cost would be huge if the model is large. To remedy this issue, we propose a communication efficient federated learning method with knowledge distillation, which can reduce the parameters to be communicated and meanwhile keep competitive model performance.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, the communication efficiency of federated learning can be improved by gradient compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Konečnỳ et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
Both genres of methods are orthogonal in reducing the communication cost of federated learning and are usually compatible with each other.
A core technique used by existing knowledge distillation-based federated learning methods is codistillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Anil et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.
In this method, the models on different clients are learned on the same dataset.
The output of each model is regularized to be similar to the ensemble of predictions from all models via a distillation loss.
The idea of codistillation is used by several methods to reduce communication cost of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sui et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Li and Wang (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Seo et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Lin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>); Sun and Lyu (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sui et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposed a federated ensemble distillation approach for medical relation extraction.
It first learns student models locally on each client and then uses the student models to generate predictions on a shared dataset and upload them to a server.
The server ensembles the predictions from different clients as a virtual teacher and computes the distillation loss between the teacher and students.
In this way, the model parameters do not need to be uploaded, and only the predictions on the shared dataset are communicated, which can reduce the communication cost.
However, these methods require a dataset that is shared among different clients to conduct ensemble distillation.
Unfortunately, in many scenarios such as personalized recommendation, the data (e.g., user behavior logs) is highly privacy-sensitive and cannot be shared or exchange among different clients.
Thus, these methods cannot be applied to these scenarios.
By contrast, our approach circumvents the need of a shared dataset because the teacher models in our approach are locally stored on different clients.
Our approach can also effectively reduce the communication cost by communicating a distilled tiny student model instead of the original large model and using SVD to reduce gradient size.</p>

In each iteration, each client simultaneously computes the update of the local teacher model and the student model based on the supervision of the labeled local data and the knowledge distilled from each other.
The teacher models are locally updated, while the student model is shared among different clients and are learned collaboratively.
Since the local teacher models have more sophisticated architectures than the student model, the useful knowledge encoded by the teacher model can help teach the student model.
In addition, since the teacher model can only learn from local data while the student model can see the data on all clients, the teacher can also benefit from the knowledge distilled from the student model.</p>

In this way, the distillation intensity is weak if the predictions of teacher and student are not reliable.
The distillation loss becomes dominant if the student and teacher are well tuned, which has the potential to mitigate the risk of overfitting.
In addition, previous works have validated that transferring knowledge between the hidden states <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sun et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and hidden attention matrices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jiao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> (if available) is beneficial for student teaching.
Thus, taking language model distillation as an example, we also introduce additional adaptive hidden losses to align the hidden states and attention heatmaps of the student and the local teachers.

Here we propose to control the intensity of the adaptive hidden loss based on the prediction correctness of the student and teacher.
Besides, motivated by the task-specific distillation framework in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, we also learn the student model based on the task-specific labels on each client.
Thus, on each client the unified loss functions for computing the local update of teacher and student models (denoted as <math id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{L}_{t,i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2a"><msub id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3.2.cmml">ℒ</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.1.1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.2.cmml">i</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.3.2">ℒ</ci><list id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.1.1.1.1">𝑡</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2.2.2.2">𝑖</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p2.22.m8.2c">\mathcal{L}_{t,i}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{L}_{s,i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2a"><msub id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3.2.cmml">ℒ</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.1.1.1.1.cmml">s</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.2.cmml">i</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.3.2">ℒ</ci><list id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.1.1.1.1">𝑠</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2.2.2.2">𝑖</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p2.23.m9.2c">\mathcal{L}_{s,i}</annotation></semantics></math>) are formulated as follows:</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.14" class="ltx_p">In our <span id="S3.SS3.p1.14.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> framework, although the size of student model updates is smaller than the teacher models, the communication cost can still be relatively high when the student model is not tiny.
Thus, we propose to a dynamic gradients approximation method to compress the gradients exchanged among the server and clients to further reduce computational cost.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1 Federated Learning ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ FedKD: Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we first factorize the local gradients into smaller matrices before uploading them.
The server reconstructs the local gradients by multiplying the factorized matrices before aggregation.
The aggregated global gradients are further factorized, which are distributed to the clients for reconstruction and model update.

In practice, compared with the standard FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> method, the extra computational cost of learning the student model in <span id="S3.SS4.p1.13.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> is much smaller than learning the large teacher model, and SVD can also be very efficiently computed in parallel.
Thus, <span id="S3.SS4.p1.13.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> is efficient in terms of both communication and computation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our experiments are conducted in two tasks that involve user data.
The first one is personalized news recommendation, which needs to predict whether a user will click a candidate news based on the user interest inferred from historical news click behaviors.
In this task we use the <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MIND</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> dataset.<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>https://msnews.github.io/</span></span></span>
It contains the news impression logs of 1 million users on the Microsoft News platform during 6 weeks.
The logs in the last week are used for test, and the rest are for training and validation.
The second one is adverse drug reaction (ADR) mentioning tweet detection, which is a binary classification task.
We use the dataset released by the 3rd shared task of the SMM4H 2018 workshop <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Weissenbacher et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.<span id="footnote5" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">5</span>https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h18</span></span></span>
We denote this dataset as <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SMM4H</span>.
The original <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SMM4H</span> dataset contains 25,678 tweet IDs.
However, since many tweet texts in this dataset are no longer available, we only crawled 16,694 tweets for experiments.
Following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019d</a>)</cite>, we use 80% of the dataset for training, 10% for validation and 10% for test.
The detailed statistics of these two datasets are summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Datasets and Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedKD: Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
To simulate the scenario where private data is decentralized on different clients, we randomly divide the training data into 4 folds and assume that each fold is locally stored on different clients.</p>

In the methods (4)-(6), we compare the performance of their officially released 6-layer and 4-layer models.
In methods (8) and (9), we use the full UniLM model.
The results on the <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.15" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MIND</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.16" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SMM4H</span> datasets are respectively shown in Tables <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedKD: Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedKD: Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
From the results, we have the following findings.
First, compared with <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.17" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM (local)</span>, other methods achieve better performance.
This is because the local data on a single client may not be sufficient to learn a strong model, while federated learning can exploit data decentralized on multiple clients to facilitate model training.
Second, although <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.18" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM</span> achieves the best performance, the communication cost for model learning is huge (e.g., over 2GB for each client on the <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.19" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MIND</span> dataset).
Thus, it may be difficult to incorporate it in real-world applications.
Third, compared with the off-the-shelf distilled models like <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.20" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DistilBERT</span>, <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.21" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BERT-PKD</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.22" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TinyBERT</span>, our <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.23" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> approach performs better.
This is because the former methods are distilled in a task-agnostic manner, which may be suboptimal in downstream tasks without further task-specific distillation.
Fourth, <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.24" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> also outperforms <span id="S4.SS2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM<sub id="S4.SS2.p1.2.2.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS2.p1.2.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">4</span></sub></span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p1.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM<sub id="S4.SS2.p1.3.3.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS2.p1.3.3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">2</span></sub></span>.
This is because <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.25" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> can learn useful knowledge from the output and intermediate results of the sophisticated local teacher models while <span id="S4.SS2.p1.4.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM<sub id="S4.SS2.p1.4.4.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS2.p1.4.4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">4</span></sub></span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM<sub id="S4.SS2.p1.5.5.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">2</span></sub></span> cannot.
Fifth, <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.26" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> can achieve better performance and lower communication cost than other communication efficient methods like <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.27" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedtchSGD</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.28" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedDropout</span>.
It is because <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.29" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> can transfer rich knowledge between the teacher and student models to improve the model performance, and can reduce the communication cost by exchanging the updates of a small student model and meanwhile compress the gradients with SVD.
Sixth, the communication cost of <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.30" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> is much less than the original <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.31" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM</span> model, and the performance of <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.32" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> is comparable with <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.33" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM (Fed)</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.34" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM (Cen)</span>.
These results show that <span id="S4.SS2.p1.5.35" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> can effectively reduce the communication cost of federated learning while keeping good performance.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We also verify the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive mutual distillation method.
We first compare the performance of <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> models trained with or without mutual distillation (the teacher model is only learned on local data), as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedKD: Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.<span id="footnote9" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">9</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">9</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">9</span>We only include results on <span id="footnote9.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MIND</span> due to space limit. The results on <span id="footnote9.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SMM4H</span> are in Appendix.</span></span></span>
We observe that mutual distillation can effectively improve the performance of both teacher and student models with different sizes, especially the teacher model.
This is because useful knowledge transferred between the teachers and student can help student better imitate the complicated teacher models, and can help teachers break the limitation of the amount of local labeled data.
In addition, we observe that local teachers slightly outperform the student.
Thus, we choose to use the teacher models for inference in the test stages.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We further compare <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> and its variants with the adaptive mutual distillation loss, the adaptive hidden loss or the adaptive loss weighting method removed, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedKD: Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (we report the performance of teacher models).
We can see that both adaptive mutual distillation and adaptive hidden losses are useful for improving the model performance.
In addition, the performance is suboptimal when the adaptive loss weighting method is removed (this variant is similar to the standard mutual distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>).
This is because weighting the distillation and hidden losses can be aware of the correctness of model predictions, which may help distill higher-quality knowledge and meanwhile mitigate the risk of overfitting.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We study the influence of client number on the model performance in this section.
We divide the full training data into different numbers of folds to simulate the scenarios with different amounts of labeled data on each client.
Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Effectiveness of Adaptive Mutual Distillation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedKD: Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the performance of <span id="S4.SS4.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> and <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM<sub id="S4.SS4.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_sub">4/2</sub></span> under different numbers of clients.
We find the performance of <span id="S4.SS4.p1.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> is similar and can even be slightly improved when more clients are involved.
This is because <span id="S4.SS4.p1.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> can learn from multiple teacher models on different clients, which can encode richer knowledge when more teacher models participate.
On the contrary, the performance of <span id="S4.SS4.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniLM<sub id="S4.SS4.p1.2.2.1" class="ltx_sub">4/2</sub> (Fed)</span> slightly declines with the increase of client number.
This may be because the vanilla FedAvg method has some performance sacrifice by learning models for multiple epochs on limited local data.</p>

<div id="S4.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we present some analysis of our proposed SVD-based gradient compression method.
We show the cumulative energy distributions of singular values of different parameter gradient matrices in the UniLM model in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.4 Influence of Client Number ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedKD: Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, which reveals several interesting findings.
First, all kinds of parameter matrices in UniLM are low-rank, especially the parameters in the feed-forward network.
Thus, the communication cost can be greatly reduced by compressing the low-rank gradient matrices.
In addition, we find the singular value energy is more concentrated at the beginning than the end of training.
This may be because when the model is not well-tuned, the gradients may have more low frequency components that aim to push the model to converge more quickly.
However, when the model gets to converge, the updates of model parameters are usually subtle, which yields more high frequency components.

We can see that more singular values need to be retained to achieve the same energy threshold.

In our approach, we propose an adaptive mutual distillation method to reciprocally learn a teacher model and a student model on each client, where the distillation intensity is controlled by their prediction correctness.
The large teacher model is locally updated, while the small student model is shared among different clients and learned collaboratively, which can effectively reduce the communication cost.
In addition, we propose a dynamic gradient approximation method to further reduce the communication cost.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets for different tasks validate that <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedKD</span> can largely reduce the communication cost in federated learning while keeping promising model performance.</p>
