<p id="id18.id1" class="ltx_p">Medical named entity recognition (NER) has wide applications in intelligent healthcare.
Sufficient labeled data is critical for training accurate medical NER model.
However, the labeled data in a single medical platform is usually limited.
Although labeled datasets may exist in many different medical platforms, they cannot be directly shared since medical data is highly privacy-sensitive.
In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving medical NER method based on federated learning, which can leverage the labeled data in different platforms to boost the training of medical NER model and remove the need of exchanging raw data among different platforms.
Since the labeled data in different platforms usually has some differences in entity type and annotation criteria, instead of constraining different platforms to share the same model, we decompose the medical NER model in each platform into a shared module and a private module.
The private module is used to capture the characteristics of the local data in each platform, and is updated using local labeled data.
The shared module is learned across different medical platform to capture the shared NER knowledge.
Its local gradients from different platforms are aggregated to update the global shared module, which is further delivered to each platform to update their local shared modules.
Experiments on three publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Medical named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify medical entities (e.g., drug names, adverse reactions and symptoms) from unstructured medical texts and classify them into different categories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>.
It can be used in many intelligent healthcare tasks such as pharmocovigilance and health monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang and Zhang (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>.
Medical NER has attracted increasing attentions in NLP community, and many methods have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Alex et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>); Ekbal and Saha (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>); Dai et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
For example, Habibi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Habibi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> proposed a LSTM-CRF approach, which used LSTM to encode context information within a sentence and used CRF to jointly decode word labels.
Gridach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gridach (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> further improved this approach by adding an additional character-level LSTM to better encode medical words.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Sufficient labeled data is critical for these methods to train accurate medical NER model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ratinov and Roth (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>.
However, the labeled medical data in a single medical platform such as a hospital is usually limited.
Annotating sufficient labeled data for medical NER is very expensive and time-consuming, and requires huge expertise in medical domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Abacha and Zweigenbaum (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>.
Although many medical platforms may have some annotated medical NER datasets, they cannot be directly shared to train medical NER models since medical data has rich information of patients and is highly privacy-sensitive.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> proposed a privacy-preserving machine learning framework named federated learning, where the user data is locally stored and a master server coordinates massive user devices to collaboratively train a global model by aggregating the local model updates.
Motivated by federated learning, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving medical NER method named <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span>.
It can leverage the knowledge in the labeled data of different medical platforms to boost the training of medical NER model in each platform without uploading or exchanging the raw medical data.
Since the labeled data in different platforms may have some differences in entity type and annotation criteria,
different from the original federated learning framework where all users share the same model, in our <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span> method we decompose the medical NER model in each platform into a shared module and a private module.
The private module is used to capture the characteristics of the local data in each platform, and is updated using the gradients computed from the local labeled data.
The shared module is used to capture the shared knowledge among different platforms to empower the training of medical NER model in each single platform.
Its gradients from different medical platforms are aggregated into a unified one to update the global shared module, which is further delivered to each platform to update the local shared module.
Above process is repeated for multiple times until model converges.
We conduct experiments on three publicly available medical NER datasets.
The experimental results validate that our method can boost the performance of medical NER by leveraging the labeled data on different platforms for model training in a collaborative way, and at the same time remove the need to directly exchange raw data among different platforms for better privacy protection.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Medical named entity recognition is a challenging research topic as it requires both understanding of texts and domain knowledge.
Both rule-based methods and statistical methods are proposed to tackle NER in the medical domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dong et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Nadeau and Sekine (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>.
For example, Embarek et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Embarek and Ferret (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> developed a rule-based tagging systems by capturing linguistic patterns, e.g., inflected form and lemma.
Other rule-based approaches involve some domain-specific knowledge bases or tools, such as MetaMap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Aronson (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite> and UMLS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Odisho* et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
However, most of these rule-based methods require heavy effort and expertise to design effective rules.
Thus, statistical methods have also been widely adopted, ranging from SVM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Isozaki and Kazawa (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>)</cite> to more recent neural methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Jain (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.
For instance, Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> proposed to use bi-directional LSTM to learn both character and word embeddings and CRF for label decoding.
Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> proposed a joint learning approach for medical entity recognition and normalization.
It uses a character-level CNN to form word representations along with the pre-trained word embeddings and a Bi-LSTM to learn contextual representation of words.
One problem for these methods is the dependency on a large-scale and well-annotated corpus, facing a small corpora, their performances may degrade significantly.
However, the labeled data in one single medical platform is usually limited, and annotating a large-scale corpora is laborious and time-consuming.
Without sufficient labeled data, it is difficult for these deep learning based methods to achieve satisfactory performance.
Although different medical platforms may have some own labeled datasets, they cannot be directly aggregated since medical data is highly privacy-sensitive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sweeney (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>)</cite>.
Both uploading medical data from different platforms to a server and exchanging it between different platforms will cause high risk of privacy leakage.
Moreover, recent laws and regulations such as GDPR<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://gdpr-info.eu/</span></span></span> have enforced strict requirements on protecting the privacy of user data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated learning is proposed by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> to collectively train intelligent models from the locally stored data of massive users and remove the need to upload it to server to reduce the risk of privacy and security.
In federated learning, all user client share the same model which is coordinated by a central server.
Each client updates its local model with private data and transmits the local model update to the central server.
The server then aggregates received model updates from massive user clients, updates the global model and distributes the new model to each client for next-round training.
In federated learning, the raw data never leaves the user devices and only model updates are uploaded to server, which generally contain less information than the raw data.
Federated learning has been applied to a few NLP tasks to exploit the corpus from different sources in a privacy-preserving way <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jiang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Hardy et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
For instance, Jiang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jiang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> proposed a federated topic modeling approach, which trains a unified high-quality topic model using data from multiple sensitive text corpus.
In existing federated learning methods, different clients usually share the same model, assuming that the private data of different clients share the same characteristics.
However, in medical NER, the entity types and annotation criteria of different medical platforms usually have significant difference.
Thus, in our <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span> method we decompose the medical NER model on each medical platform into a shared module and a private module to leverage the shareable knowledge among different platforms and at the same time capturing the characteristics of the data on each platform.</p>

The first layer is a word-level CNN, which aims to capture local context information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kim (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.
Many medical entities are the short combination of several words, e.g., “itchy scalp” and “restless leg syndrome”.
Thus, modeling relations between near neighbours may help better recognize entities.

The second layer is a Bi-LSTM, which aims to model long-distance dependencies between words in both directions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Huang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.
Some descriptions of health condition have a relatively long span, and modeling only local contexts may be insufficient.
For instance, in the expression “hair has been definitely falling out”, the interaction between “hair” and “falling out” is essential for entity prediction.
Thus, we use a Bi-LSTM layer to model this kind of relationship.
The output of the Bi-LSTM layer is the contextual sequence <math id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="[\mathbf{r}_{1},\mathbf{r}_{2},...,\mathbf{r}_{k}]" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.4" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml">[</mo><msub id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.2.cmml">𝐫</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.5" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.cmml">𝐫</mi><mn id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><mo id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.6" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">…</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.7" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.2.cmml">𝐫</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.8" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml">]</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4b"><list id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3"><apply id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.2">𝐫</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.1.1.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2">𝐫</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.2.2.3">2</cn></apply><ci id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1">…</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.2">𝐫</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3">𝑘</ci></apply></list></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p3.3.m3.4c">[\mathbf{r}_{1},\mathbf{r}_{2},...,\mathbf{r}_{k}]</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we introduce our privacy-preserving approach for medical NER.
The framework of our approach is shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 FedNER Method ‣ FedNER: Privacy-preserving Medical Named Entity Recognition with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
In this framework, the server coordinates multiple clients for local model updating and global model sharing.
To be more specific, the clients here are different medical platforms, and train their local models with privately stored data.
The central server monitors each platform for gradient aggregation and performs global model updating once it has collected gradients from all platforms.
Then it distributes the updated parameters of the shared model to each platform for next-round model training.
The overall learning framework of FedNER is illustrated in Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="In 3.2 FedNER Framework ‣ 3 FedNER Method ‣ FedNER: Privacy-preserving Medical Named Entity Recognition with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the training phase, each platform computes the model gradients using its locally stored data.
The data distribution across different platforms is non-I.I.D., and each platform keeps its data as private, only updating gradients obtained from the data training process.
Since the medical data stored in different platforms may have different characteristics and annotation criteria, sharing all model parameters between them may not be an optimal solution.
For example, some platforms may use the BIO tagging scheme while others may prefer the more complex BIOES tagging scheme.
Besides, some platforms mainly aim to find drug names and their corresponding dosages, while others may be more user-oriented, requiring the system to recognize user symptoms and adverse drug effects.
Thus, we propose to decompose the model into a shared module and a private module.
The private module consists of two top layers in our medical NER model, i.e, Bi-LSTM and CRF, which aim to learn platform-specific context representations and label decoding strategies.<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>The partition strategy of the private module and shared module will be further discussed in Section <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Model Decomposition Strategy ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedNER: Privacy-preserving Medical Named Entity Recognition with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</span></span></span>
We train the private module only with local data and exchange neither its parameters nor gradients.
The shared module consists of the other bottom layers in our NER model, such as the word-level CNN and all types of embedding.
Different from the private module, the shared one mainly aims to capture the semantic information in texts.
Since training of this shared module involves tuning embedding and filters for medical domain, a large-scale and well-annotated corpus is usually necessary.
However, the labeled data in one single platform may be insufficient and usually can not generalize to represent an overall non-I.I.D. data distribution.
Moreover, simply sharing the raw data among platforms may make up data shortage at the sacrifice of privacy.
Thus, we propose to share this model among all platforms in a federated learning framework.
This framework facilitates model training by leveraging the useful information of labeled data in different platforms.</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
The detailed information of these datasets is listed in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Dataset and Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedNER: Privacy-preserving Medical Named Entity Recognition with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Among all three datasets, there are 341 overlapping entities between them.
For each dataset, we randomly sample 80% of sentences as training data, and the rest as testing data.
For word embedding, we use the pretrained Glove embedding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pennington et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, which has a dimension of 300.
The dimension of the randomly initialized character embedding is 100.
The convolution layers of character-level and word-level CNN have 200 filters, with a kernel size of 3.
The Bi-LSTM layer has 2<math id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><times id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>200 hidden states.

We independently repeat each experiment 10 times and report the average strict F1 and relax F1 scores.
Under strict F1 evaluation, entity spans are considered correct only if position indices exactly match the gold annotations.
Under relax F1 evaluation, only an overlap between the the range of predicted positions and gold annotations is needed.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We have two main findings from the results.
First, compared with other baseline NER methods, <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ELMoNER</span> can achieve better performances.
This is because <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ELMoNER</span> learns word representation at both word level and character level.
By learning a character-level word representation, the model may better handle out-of-vocabulary medical terminologies by looking at their character contexts.
Besides, <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ELMoNER</span> captures both local and long-term context information by using a combination of CNN and Bi-LSTM networks.
Furthermore, it also utilizes context-aware word representations generated by the pre-trained language model ELMo to enhance representations of words.</p>

This is because the labeled data in a single medical platform is usually limited and insufficient to train an accurate NER model, and the datasets from different medical platforms cannot be exchanged due to the privacy sensitivity.
Different from the baseline methods which are trained on the data of a single medical platform, our <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span> method can leverage the labeled data from different medical platforms in a privacy-preserving way to learn the shareable NER knowledge and alleviate the data sparsity problem.

We find that if the module is not shared, the performance is sub-optimal, since the shareable knowledge among different platforms is not exploited at all, and the labeled data on a single platform is insufficient to train an accurate enough model.
However, if all platforms share the same model, the performance is also not optimal.
This happens because the data on different platforms usually has different characteristics such as entity types and annotation criteria, which cannot be captured if we constrain different platforms to share exactly the same model.
These results validate the effectiveness of our strategy in decomposing the neural medical NER model into a shared module to learn the general and shareable knowledge for NER from multiple platforms, and a private module to capture the local data characteristics.</p>

In this section we explore this assumption by randomly masking different ratios of overlapped entities in training data.
The experimental results are shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.5 Influence of Overlapped Entity Number ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FedNER: Privacy-preserving Medical Named Entity Recognition with Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
We have two findings from the results.
First, when there are more overlapped entities, the performance improvement of <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span> over single-platform training is more significant.
This is intuitive, since the knowledge of overlapped entities can be easily learned in <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span> by leveraging the information of different platforms for model training.
Second, even all the overlapped entities are masked, <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span> can still bring consistent performance improvement.
This result shows that our <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span> can learn some generalized knowledge of NER from the data of different platforms, rather than only the knowledge of overlapped entities.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedNER</span> method for medical NER.
It can train medical NER models by leveraging the labeled data on different platforms meanwhile removing the need
to directly exchange the privacy-sensitive medical data among different platforms for better privacy protection.
We decompose the medical NER model in each platform into a shared module and a private module.
The private module is updated in each platform using the local data to model the platform-specific characteristics.
The shared module is used to capture the shareable knowledge among different platforms, and is updated in a server based on the aggregated gradients from multiple platforms.
It is further sent to each platform for next-round training.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets show our method can effectively improve the performance of medical NER by exploiting the useful information of multiple medical platforms in a privacy-preserving way.</p>
