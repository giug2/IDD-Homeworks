<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper focuses on Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL) where each client continues to learn incremental tasks where their domain shifts from each other.
We propose a novel adaptive knowledge matching-based personalized FDIL approach (pFedDIL) which allows each client to alternatively utilize appropriate incremental task learning strategy on the correlation with the knowledge from previous tasks. More specifically, when a new task arrives, each client first calculates its local correlations with previous tasks.
Then, the client can choose to adopt a new initial model or a previous model with similar knowledge to train the new task and simultaneously migrate knowledge from previous tasks based on these correlations.
Furthermore, to identify the correlations between the new task and previous tasks for each client, we separately employ an auxiliary classifier to each target classification model and propose sharing partial parameters between the target classification model and the auxiliary classifier to condense model parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of which results demonstrate that pFedDIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 14.35% in terms of average accuracy of all tasks.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has become a basic paradigm that facilitates collaborative training of deep neural networks (DNNs) from distributed clients while preserving their data privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mcmahan2017communication</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zhang2021survey</span>]</cite>.
To deploy FL in real-world applications, it is practical that each client can continuously learn new incremental tasks while retaining the accuracy for the previous tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">yoon2021federated</span>]</cite>.
However, history data may often be out of reach with privacy constraints like GDPR and many studies have shown that DNNs will forget the knowledge of previous tasks when learning new tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">van2022three</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">tankard2016gdpr</span>]</cite>. Such a phenomenon is known as ’Catastrophic Forgetting’, which is a major challenge of incremental learning in the centralized setting. Especially, this challenge is even more formidable to solve in the FL scenario, where the limited previous data are stored in distributed clients and cannot be accessed by each other <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zhang2023target</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">bakman2023federated</span>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many recent studies have been proposed to solve the catastrophic forgetting challenge in federated incremental learning. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">yoon2021federated</span>]</cite> aims to learn a personalized model for each client by decomposing the model parameters into shared parameters and adaptive parameters and transferring common knowledge between similar tasks across clients. FCIL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">dong2022federated</span>]</cite> addresses the federated class-incremental learning and trains a global model by computing additional class-imbalance losses. Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ijcai2022p0303</span>]</cite> utilize extra data at both the server and client sides to conduct knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">qi2023better</span>]</cite> optimize the generative network and reconstruct previous samples for replay. Recently, Re-Fed is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Li_2024_CVPR</span>]</cite> to prevent catastrophic forgetting with synergistic replay by caching important samples which contribute to both the local and global understanding.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While these approaches have achieved great success, they are generally designed for the scenario where the new tasks are incremental classes, i.e., Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL). These methods may lose their effectiveness when the new tasks have the same classes but their domain shift with different feature distributions, i.e., Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL).
To elaborate further, the FCIL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">dong2022federated</span>]</cite> method relies on changes in the new data category label in incremental tasks to alleviate forgetting of previous tasks; FOT<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">bakman2023federated</span>]</cite> projects different incremental tasks into different orthogonal subspaces, which means feature isolation for different tasks, but if suffers from the intersected feature space boundaries of incremental tasks. The primary challenge in implementing FCIL methods in the context of FDIL is that FCIL methods typically depend on the connection between previous and new classes, which is not applicable in FDIL scenarios where the classes remain consistent.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we seek to tackle the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in the FDIL scenario. A simple way to address this problem is to train different models for each incremental task. However, this requires extensive storage and time-consuming re-training. Additionally, all these models need to be saved for future use which is laborious because we need to manually select the appropriate mode for each inference data. Instead of training a separate model for each different task, a better solution is to ideally have only a single model that can work in all incremental tasks. However, naively training a model for all tasks can lead to terrible catastrophic forgetting when the unique knowledge in the new task overlaps the ones in the previous tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike in the FCIL scenario, where incremental tasks involve data from different categories, In the FDIL scenario, the incremental tasks involve data from different domains, i.e., handwritten digit data and cartoon digit data. Compared to the data from different categories in FCIL. i.e., cat data and dog data, there is more shared feature information between the different incremental tasks, which can facilitate the overall FDIL task<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">liu2019compact</span>]</cite>.
The key to efficiently learning new tasks while memorizing previous tasks in the FDIL scenario is to identify the correlation between incremental tasks and then share the useful common knowledge in different tasks. Like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">yoon2021federated</span>]</cite> in FCIL, we consider each client maintains their personalized models while the number of personalized models is under a given threshold due to the limited capacity of each client. Given the correlation between tasks, each client can maintain several personalized models and share the same model between similar tasks. In this way, the client can choose a model with tasks most similar to the new task, enabling the acquisition of new task knowledge while retaining existing task knowledge. This dual benefit permits the new task to also capitalize on previous knowledge, ultimately enhancing performance. Nonetheless, considering the tasks come incrementally, identifying the inter-task correlations and subsequently training the selected model is challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle these limitations, we in this paper propose a novel <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P</span>ersonalized <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">D</span>omain-<span id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">I</span>ncremental <span id="S1.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">L</span>earning (pFedDIL) approach which adaptively matches and migrates knowledge among different incremental tasks.
More specifically, we propose that each client employs a small auxiliary classifier for each personalized model which is trained to distinguish itself from other tasks. Using the auxiliary classifiers of previous tasks, each client can adaptively identify the correlation of the new task to all previous tasks. Based on these correlations, each client can match the new task with a suitable model, i.e., a new initialized model or a previous model but with similar knowledge. To maximize the training efficiency of the matched model over the new task, we further allow each client to migrate knowledge from other not matched but similar personalized models in a weighted manner, where the weights are the correlations obtained previously.
Furthermore, to reduce the size of auxiliary classifiers while enhancing their performance, we propose sharing partial parameters between the target personalized model and the auxiliary classifier.
Finally, considering the presence of multiple personalized local models within each client that could lead to additional inference costs, we apply a weighted ensemble distillation over these models where the weights are also obtained from the output of the auxiliary classifiers.</p>

Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning approach that trains a global model by merging multiple locally trained models on private datasets<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">li2020review</span>]</cite>.
A significant challenge in FL is data heterogeneity, where data distribution among clients is non-identically and independently distributed (Non-IID), negatively impacting model performance<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Jeong2018CommunicationEfficientOM</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wang2023fedcda</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Shen2020FederatedML</span>]</cite>.
FedAvg is a notable FL method that refines the global model by incorporating parameters trained on local private data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mcmahan2017communication</span>]</cite>.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">li2020federated</span>]</cite> propose a proximal term to align closely with the global model.
The federated distillation method<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wang2023dafkd</span>]</cite> suggests distilling multiple local models into a global one by only aggregating soft output predictions.
However, existing FL approaches typically assume that the data in each client is static, which cannot account for incremental data with domain shift.</p>

Incremental learning (IL) is a learning paradigm that empowers a model to learn sequentially from a series of tasks while preserving the knowledge acquired from previous tasks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wang2024comprehensive</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zhao2023does</span>]</cite>. IL can be segmented into three primary variants: task-incremental learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Maltoni2018ContinuousLI</span>]</cite>, class-incremental learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">rebuffi2017icarl</span>]</cite> and domain-incremental learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mirza2022efficient</span>]</cite>. Existing strategies can further be grouped into three categories: replay-based methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">rolnick2019experience</span>]</cite>, regularization-based methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Jung2020ContinualLW</span>]</cite> and parameter isolation methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">chen2020mitigating</span>]</cite>.
Most IL methods are designed for task-IL or class-IL and are typically server-based. This work focuses on the federated domain-incremental learning scenario and proposes the pFedDIL technique.</p>

Federated Incremental Learning (FIL), an approach that targets the dynamic adaptation of streaming tasks within each client’s environment, emphasizes the seamless integration of new data into the global model while preserving the acquired knowledge from previous data streams. Despite its crucial role, FIL has garnered attention relatively recently, with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">yoon2021federated</span>]</cite> pioneering the field by focusing on Task-Incremental Learning (Task-IL) in FL. In parallel, studies such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">yu2024personalized</span>]</cite> takes the multi-granularity expression of knowledge into account, promoting the spatial-temporal integration of knowledge in FCIL. Conversely, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Dong_2023_ICCV</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">10323204</span>]</cite> simplify the problem’s complexity by presupposing clients possess sufficient storage capacity to retain historical examples and engage in data sharing, a scenario that deviates from the conventional federated learning paradigm. Beyond image classification, investigations like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Jiang_2021</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">10204005</span>]</cite> extend the horizons of FIL into diverse domains. Our research focuses on the domain shift between different tasks and the transfer of the common knowledge.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The key idea of the pFedDIL is to identify the correlation between the new and previous tasks such that clients can adaptively migrate knowledge from previous tasks to improve performance.
Specifically, in each communication round, the client in pFedDIL trains the local model with its private sequence of tasks and the server aggregates local models from all participating clients. Then, when it comes to new tasks, each client first employs the existing personalized models’ auxiliary classifiers to calculate the correlations denoted as knowledge matching intensity and applies the appropriate incremental task learning strategy: training the new task with a previous personalized local model which has the most similar knowledge or training with a new initial model. Simultaneously, each client can migrate knowledge from other personalized local models with the knowledge matching intensity to to assist in training. During the inference stage, the final inference result is aggregated by all personalized local models weighted by the corresponding auxiliary classifiers. Moreover, we propose sharing partial parameters between the auxiliary classifier and the target personalized model to condense model parameters. The workflow of the pFedDIL is shown in Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.2 The Proposed pFedDIL Approach ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Personalized Federated Domain-Incremental Learning based on Adaptive Knowledge Matching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

Besides, the client will sacrifice some storage by training the new task with the new initial model parameters to ensure accuracy for both the new task and previous tasks.
