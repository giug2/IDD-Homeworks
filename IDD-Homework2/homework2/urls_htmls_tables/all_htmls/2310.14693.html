<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed method for edge-level machine learning, particularly for privacy-sensitive applications such as those in military and medical domains, where client data cannot be shared or transferred to a cloud computing server. In many use-cases, communication cost is a major challenge in FL due to its natural intensive network usage. Client devices, such as smartphones or Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, have limited resources in terms of energy, computation, and memory. To address these hardware constraints, lightweight models and compression techniques such as pruning and quantization are commonly adopted in centralised paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the impact of compression techniques on FL for a typical image classification task. Going further, we demonstrate that a straightforward method can compresses messages up to 50% while having less than 1% of accuracy loss, competing with state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The development of approaches for training machine learning models while preserving data privacy has long been a goal. In traditional machine learning, embedded systems send their raw data over a network to a powerful server, which then trains the model and sends it back. However, this process raises confidentiality issues, such as data interception during communication and unauthorised access to user data by the server owner or a third party. In standard Federated Learning (FL), the server sends a model to a group of clients, who train it on their local data and then send their updated parameters back to the server for aggregation. By reversing the training process in this way, FL attempts to better guarantee the confidentiality of user data, since data never leaves a client device. An overview of the process can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated learning compression designed for lightweight communications This work is supported by the Futur et Ruptures program funded by IMT and Institut Carnot TSN, and by the GdR ISIS." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These embedded devices such as IoT devices, smartphones and drones are well suited to FL applications due to their proximity to real-world data and applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, many of these devices have limited computational resources and co-design techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> are continually being explored to match algorithms to hardware constraints. Among the emerging research topics for FL at the edge/device level, the field of neural network compression is a promising way to tackle the constraints of devices exploiting FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is a distributed framework that enables collaborative training of machine learning (ML) models on multiple devices, called clients, via a central coordinator, usually a server with large compute resources. Clients are commonly embedded devices, such as smartphones. Differing from traditional ML, each client trains its own local model and shares only the local training results, like model parameters or gradients, with the server. Through this mechanism, multiple clients can jointly contribute to train a global model without sharing their data. In each federated training cycle, commonly referred to as a ’round,’ the server distributes the current model to a subset of clients, who perform local training on the model and subsequently send back the updated results. The final step involves aggregating, on the server-side, client’s contribution to create a global model, which ideally can represent the knowledge from each client. Each round involves downloading the model and several training iterations at client level.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Model compression is a widely adopted solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to reduce the computational and memory requirements of a model. Among existing compression techniques, quantization and pruning have been implemented to reduce the complexity of inference and training of neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Pruning aims to reduce the complexity of a model by removing redundant or unnecessary parts of an architecture. Very wide and deep models tend to yield good results, but the contribution of each of its elements to the performance of the whole network is not homogeneous. So, by observing each architectural element of the network, it is possible to eliminate those that have little impact. There are two possible approaches to pruning in the context of neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The first is to replace the value of certain weights with zeros, which is commonly referred to as unstructured pruning. The second approach consists of pruning entire structures within the network, such as kernels, filters or layers, which do not contribute significantly to the network’s performance. This approach is known as structured pruning. On the other hand, unstructured pruning can also offer compression benefits for FL through the use of entropy coding techniques, such as Huffman <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> coding, by exploiting sparse parameters. So far works in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> have used pruning to reduce communication cost by an order of 4.5 times. This is a significant consideration since typical FL clients often encompass low-power devices and operate in challenging transmission environments, such as long-distance or underwater communications.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another widely applied technique is quantization, neural network models are generally constructed using 32-bit floating point numbers (FP32), which are more expensive in terms of computation, memory and energy than integers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In centralized machine learning is well-known that full-precision, FP32, it’s not a necessary condition to obtain close to state-of-the-art results for inference and training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

First, a sparse training method named SWAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and second, a layer-wise pruning based on weight importance. However as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> communications cost can be much higher than the training cost.

Unlike previous works, our objective is to demonstrate that the conventional FL framework can be modified to support sparse messages. This method results in a compression of approximately 50% of the original size while preserving accuracy with less than a 1% loss. Our implementation is streamlined and easily extendable, making it compatible with more advanced FL algorithms.</p>

Initially, without pruning, our baseline has a higher accuracy than ZeroFL and as far as we have understood, there are two main distinctions. Firstly, we do not employ SWAT for local training. Secondly, we use a batch size of 8, whereas ZeroFL does not indicate the specific batch size used. As previously observed in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the batch size is a crucial hyperparameter that influences the aggregation accuracy. Even though SWAT plays a significant role in reducing the communication cost, it also has an impact on the model accuracy, resulting in an overall hindrance. This effect can be noticed as our baseline, which uses pure FedAvg without any compression, already achieves higher accuracy, 4%, when compared to ZeroFL. We observe that for the same level of pruning, our approach exhibits proportionally less degradation. For instance, while ZeroFL experiences an 8% accuracy degradation to prune the model to 10 MB, we only experience a 4.63% degradation. As the results show, client’s flexibility to perform pruning on its own better compensates for the sparsity introduced. This compensation enables messages to be more sparse while resulting in a more robust global model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the message savings observed with the pruning experiments, one could ask if it is possible to have even smaller messages. As exposed in section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="II-B Model Compression ‣ II Background ‣ Federated learning compression designed for lightweight communications This work is supported by the Futur et Ruptures program funded by IMT and Institut Carnot TSN, and by the GdR ISIS." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span></span></a> another well-known technique for compression is quantization. In Fig <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Compressing more with Quantization ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated learning compression designed for lightweight communications This work is supported by the Futur et Ruptures program funded by IMT and Institut Carnot TSN, and by the GdR ISIS." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we show the impact of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> in the IID scenario described before. During QAT, weights are still represented as floating-point numbers but are limited to power-of-two values. At each gradient update, the values are re-evaluated and scaled. The motivation behind using QAT is to incorporate quantization noise into the training procedure, allowing the network to learn from it. We chose to work with 1-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit quantization levels, using Binary Connect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> for binary networks and the Brevitas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> framework for 4- and 8-bit with the default quantization scheme. The weights are quantized to 4-bit and 8-bit integers and the QAT scaling is calculated per layer.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Looking at Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Compressing more with Quantization ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated learning compression designed for lightweight communications This work is supported by the Futur et Ruptures program funded by IMT and Institut Carnot TSN, and by the GdR ISIS." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we can see that the convergence time, i.e. the number of rounds needed to reach maximum accuracy, is not the same from one experiment to another, as it also depends on the level of quantization. In addition to the fact that the 4- and 8-bit format enables us to achieve an accuracy comparable to the reference, it also reveals a compromise between communication and computation. In order to achieve a similar accuracy of around 75%, Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Compressing more with Quantization ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated learning compression designed for lightweight communications This work is supported by the Futur et Ruptures program funded by IMT and Institut Carnot TSN, and by the GdR ISIS." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, it is necessary to perform 40 rounds of communication and 40 total epochs when using 1 local epoch, while in the case of 10 local epochs, 100 total epochs are needed within 10 rounds. Still, in the case of one bit, increasing the number of epochs per round on the client from 1 to 10 considerably increases accuracy, from 48.8 % to 70.9 %, with the total number of epochs increasing from 100 to 1000, with the same communication cost. As seen in the IID pruning experiment in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Exploring Magnitude Pruning ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Federated learning compression designed for lightweight communications This work is supported by the Futur et Ruptures program funded by IMT and Institut Carnot TSN, and by the GdR ISIS." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, spending more time on each client contributes to a more robust model to the perturbations introduced by the quantization.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning represents a new approach to training models in a distributed manner, bringing forth fresh optimization challenges due to the presence of embedded systems serving as FL clients. These clients operate with limited hardware, energy, and communication resources. In this article, we demonstrated the promising application of traditional neural network compression methods in the context of FL. Our easy to implement yet effective technique achieved up to a 50% reduction in message size without any significant impact on accuracy, thereby resulting in direct savings in energy and bandwidth costs. Moreover, our method allows each client to customize their pruning process, enabling greater flexibility to adapt to their unique datasets. By integrating quantization into the training process, we introduced an additional compression technique to the framework. It is conceivable that combining quantization and pruning could further enhance message compression, although our results already demonstrate the significance of both techniques individually. Based on these findings, we posit that incorporating a compression-aware training method, while ensuring seamless integration, is a crucial step in advancing the field of FL.</p>
