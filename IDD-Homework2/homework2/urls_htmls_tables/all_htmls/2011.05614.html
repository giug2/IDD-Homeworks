<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Recommender System (RS) is currently an effective way to solve information overload. To meet users’ next click behavior, RS needs to collect users’ personal information and behavior to achieve a comprehensive and profound user preference perception. However, these centrally collected data are privacy-sensitive, and any leakage may cause severe problems to both users and service providers. This paper proposed a novel privacy-preserved recommender system framework (PPRSF), through the application of federated learning paradigm, to enable the recommendation algorithm to be trained and carry out inference without centrally collecting users’ private data. The PPRSF not only able to reduces the privacy leakage risk, satisfies legal and regulatory requirements but also allows various recommendation algorithms to be applied.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the explosive development of online services, products, and information resources, the phenomenon of "information overload" is becoming more serious, which brings a significant information burden to people. Recommender Systems (RS) is currently an effective way to solve information overload and realize personalized information services. Currently, RS has played a core role in many domains, such as e-commerce (Alibaba, Amazon), video service (Netflix, YouTube, and TikTok), online-music services (Pandora, Yahoo), Advertising (Google, Facebook), both the user and service providers benefit from the personalized RS. However, the current RS exists many potential risks, in which privacy leakage is one of the top concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The ultimate goal of RS is to understand user preference better than users themselves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. RS needs to collect users’ personal information and behavior to achieve a comprehensive and profound user preference perception to meet users’ next click behavior. The prediction quality varies depending on the scale, diversity, and timeliness of the data collected. However, these data quality factors are also positively related to privacy risks and the degree of harm caused by leaking these data. This is an unavoidable "privacy-personalization trade-off problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>"to the current RS. The RS’s privacy risk is mainly due to internal and external improper operations and attacks on the centrally collected and stored user information. As illustrated in Figure 1, internal privacy threats come from a curious or malicious service provider. Driven by commercial interests, service providers may violate privacy contracts and collect user data without authorization or share data with third parties. Internal staff may also use access permissions to spy on users’ privacy. External privacy threats mainly come from hacker attacks. Due to the lack of adequate data security protection, data is maliciously stolen. Sometimes there will be unconscious data leakages, such as data surveillance by law enforcement agencies or publicly anonymous data being de-anonymized (de-anonymization attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>) by a third party.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In May 2015, eBay was attacked by hackers, resulting in the disclosure of 145 million user accounts, including user names, addresses, data-of-birth, and account password. In March 2018, Facebook leaked tens of millions of users’ personal information. Many Internet companies have similar incidents, leading to large-scale user privacy data leakage, triggering user trust crisis. Consequently, people raised their attention to protect their data privacy and security and avoid their private information being collected by Internet applications. Relevant data security and privacy protection laws and regulations have been promulgated as well. The US proposed the "California Consumer Privacy Act " (CCPA)<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa</span></span></span>, the EU published "General Data Protection Regulation" (GDPR)<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>https://gdpr-info.eu/</span></span></span>, Singapore published "Personal Data Protection Act" (PDPA)<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/personal-data-protection.html</span></span></span>, and "Data Security Management Measures (Draft for Comment)" published by China. These regulations rely on a fundamental principle: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">It is up to individuals, groups, or organizations to decide when, how, and to what extent to communicate information about them to others. By Alan F. Westin</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. These regulations have made user data collection face many obstacles without users’ full authorization. In this context, the user’s local device firmly locks the critical data, forming the isolated data islands that are unable to aggregate, cause the RS to no longer personalized, and user experience also declines.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence of Federated Learning (FL) connects isolated data under the premise of ensuring data security and user privacy, thereby providing the possibility to train accurate and robust machine learning models. McMahan et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> first introduced the term FL in 2016 and applied it to update smart-phones’ voice recognition and text entry models. The Google team utilize the user’s mobile phone to train the local user interaction data, which can continuously optimize the user’s local language prediction model, and through the "Federated Averaging" algorithm (FedAvg), by averaging all stochastic gradient descent (SGD) result on user’s terminal with a central server, a globally optimized model is obtained. Currently, the study of FL has been carried out in many application fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> related to privacy protection and data security.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduced the FL paradigm into the RS and proposed a novel privacy-preserved RS framework based on FL (PPRSF) that enables the training and online inference under the premise of preserving user privacy, satisfying legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Architecture-based solutions are designed to minimize the threat of data leakage. For example, using distributed storage of user data can effectively reduce the damage caused by a single data source exposure, or distributed the recommendation process to increase the difficulty of unauthorized access to data. Based on distributed data storage, Heitmann et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a candidate architecture, in which users hold local configuration data, and the users decide which data can be disclosed to which service provider, only holding specific certificates the application can access this part of configuration data through API and use it for recommendation calculation. This method allows users to make data disclosure decisions, but it cannot avoid collecting open data by curious service providers, while users often choose to open data to obtain better services. Based on the distributed recommendation process, some studies have proposed to design and implement the recommendation process in a pure P2P system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, compare local user data with another user for similarity to obtain possible recommendation results, remove the role of the central server to avoid individuals Centralized storage of information.

<p id="S2.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DP is a privacy model based on data fuzzification, which can alleviate the risk of inferring users’ private data through the output of the recommendation system. The core idea of DP is that when the enemy tries to query individual information from the database, the data is confused by noise, so that the enemy cannot distinguish the sensitivity of the individual from the result. McSherry and Mironov <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> first applied DP to collaborative filtering, using the Laplace mechanism to generate corresponding noise on the input score, which can shield the impact of the change of a single record on the final result.

Moreover, the continuous increase of the data received by the recommendation system is a dynamic process, and the application of DP in a continuous environment is still a problem.</p>

The use of a secure multi-party calculation protocol can ensure that the user input data is in an encrypted state, but still can perform accurate calculations, and ensure that the recommended accuracy is the same as in the non-encrypted state. Its disadvantage is that it needs to consume more computing time, storage space and communication cost, and it is only suitable for offline computing.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The federated learning system (FLS) developed by the Google team uses numerous users’ smartphones as computing entities for algorithm training. This type of FLS constructed by a central server and massive terminal devices is called Centralized Cross-device FL Architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> ,illustrated in Figure 3. The Cross-device FL system has a relatively large number of members (usually smartphone), and each member has small local raw data and relatively low computation power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Therefore, this type of FL system relies on a mighty host to manage a stable communication network and cannot perform a complex machine learning task due to the limitation of member’s computation power. Generally, in the form of a centralized network. Centralized Cross-device FL Architecture allows each member to train the model locally according to their conditions, aggregate the desensitization local model parameters on the central server, form a global model, and then send it back to each member. The member updates its local model until the global model has achieved the training object. In RS, the user’s computer and smartphone as the client devices, and a central server (RS server) conducts data collection, model training, and online inference. The Centralized Cross-device FL architecture applies to the RS scenario.</p>

However, these data are public and are actively provided to the system by users. Some other user interaction behaviors, including page clicks, favorites, and likes, are also inevitably recorded by the system, as these behaviors are users’ active requests on the application. Missing these data will make the RS unable to perform the model initialization (feature engineering, sample labeling), significantly increasing the client device’s communication cost and computation load. The personal data that users do not want to disclose is private and need to be protected, such as personal information, personal health information, asset information, work information, and contact information. These data can indeed improve the RS’s personalized recommendation capabilities, but these data are sensitive. Once malicious enemies obtain them will bring great distress and risks to the user.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduced the FL paradigm into the RS and proposed a novel Privacy-preserved RS framework (PPRSF) that enables the training and online inference under the premise of preserving user privacy, satisfying legal and regulatory requirements. This framework can be applied to the application that involving sensitive user information, such as financial service, medical service, and social network.</p>
