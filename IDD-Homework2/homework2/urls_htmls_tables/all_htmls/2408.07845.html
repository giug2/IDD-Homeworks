<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">The top priority of a Housing and Homelessness System of Care (HHSC) is to connect people experiencing homelessness to supportive housing. An HHSC typically consists of many agencies serving the same population. Information technology platforms differ in type and quality between agencies, so their data are usually isolated from one agency to another. Larger agencies may have sufficient data to train and test artificial intelligence (AI) tools but smaller agencies typically do not. To address this gap, we introduce a Federated Learning (FL) approach enabling all agencies to train a predictive model collaboratively without sharing their sensitive data. We demonstrate how FL can be used within an HHSC to provide all agencies equitable access to quality AI and further assist human decision-makers in the allocation of resources within HHSC. This is achieved while preserving the privacy of the people within the data by not sharing identifying information between agencies without their consent. Our experimental results using real-world HHSC data from Calgary, Alberta, demonstrate that our FL approach offers comparable performance with the idealized scenario of training the predictive model with data fully shared and linked between agencies.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Emergency housing shelters/agencies are an important part of the housing and homelessness system of care in most North American cities. While originally intended to provide low-barrier access to shelter for short periods, many people now make use of shelters over long periods either continually (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chronic</span> shelter use) or sporadically (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">episodic</span> shelter use). Most long-term shelter users face multiple physical and mental health challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hopper, Bassuk, and Oliver <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> that prevent them from making a quick exit from the shelter system without first connecting them with housing and the wrap-around supports necessary to help them address their unique set of challenges. Helping these people exit the shelter quickly is important. Shelters are difficult environments, and the Housing First philosophy recognizes that a person having trouble exiting a shelter should be connected to support as soon as possible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Goering et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Properly matching shelter users to supportive housing is a difficult problem. In most cities, the number of supportive housing spaces is much less <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Coleman <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> than the number of new people entering homelessness. The vast majority (approximately 85%) of first-time shelter users will exit the shelter quickly and without support (<span id="Sx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">transitional</span> shelter use) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Aubry et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013a</a>; Culhane et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>. Therefore, it is the longer-term chronic and episodic shelter users who should be prioritized for the limited supply of supportive housing. However, chronic and episodic shelter use patterns can take months or even years to become evident. As a result, most government definitions of chronic homelessness require a history of homelessness that is one year or longer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Byrne and Culhane <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. Requiring a person to live in a shelter for this length of time before they can demonstrate a historical record of chronic or episodic homelessness is unacceptable. Living conditions in shelters are difficult and pose further risks to a person’s physical and mental health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hopper, Bassuk, and Oliver <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) has great potential for rapidly identifying which first-time shelter users are at risk of becoming chronic or episodic shelter users in the long term <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Toros and Flaming <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Purao et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Rather than requiring a person to accumulate a record of shelter use stretching over many months or years, ML can identify at-risk people using only the first few months of a person’s shelter record <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(VanBerlo et al. <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It must be stressed that the purpose of using ML within an HHSC is not to automate the decision of who should be assigned to supportive housing. The established best practice within an HHSC is to support people with a variety of programs, not a single program or automated instrument <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shinn and Richard <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. Rather than replacing front-line human staff, our tool would be used by that staff to identify possible “under the radar” shelter users who have been missed by other programs. Being identified by our machine learning approach would not automatically qualify someone for housing. Instead, it would initiate a conversation with a support worker to more fully understand that person’s needs.</p>

</figure>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While ML has great potential, the issue of equitable access to high-quality ML tools within an HHSC is challenging and nuanced. An HHSC typically consists of many not-for-profit agencies of varying sizes. Smaller agencies will usually have fewer IT resources in terms of both expertise and infrastructure. However, IT platform and talent barriers can be overcome by the pooling of resources and/or collaboration between agency IT teams.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The more difficult problem is related to equitable access to ML due to the nature of how data exists within an HHSC. Most HHSCs are made up of a large number of government and not-for-profit community-based services. The same person may interact with multiple agencies, and each agency will record those interactions in its administrative database. Predicting the risk of episodic/chronic homelessness is most accurate when training on data that captures a person’s interaction with all the agencies within an HHSC. However, maintaining a single, merged dataset for an entire HHSC is difficult. In the spirit of being a low barrier to entry, many shelters do not require a person to sign data-sharing consent forms. Agency information technology (IT) systems are often incompatible and many municipalities also lack a single system coordinator agency with the expertise and infrastructure to merge data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Matthiesen and Bjørn <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Irani et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. Finally, people are not typically assigned HHSC-wide unique identity numbers which means that merging records between agencies must be done using names and birth dates. Sharing this identifying information across agency boundaries without consent violated the privacy of the people in the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Murray <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Vatsalan, Christen, and Verykios <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; Hall and Fienberg <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The fragmentation of data across an HHSC means that agencies typically only have access to the data they collect by themselves. As a result, smaller agencies that see fewer clients will have correspondingly small data sets that make it difficult to effectively train and test an ML model. Equitable access to ML means overcoming this barrier and ensuring that all agencies have access to the same high-quality ML tools, regardless of their data set size. At the same time, the privacy of the people in the data must be respected and identifying information must not be shared between agency boundaries without consent.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Our solution is to utilize a Federated Learning (FL) approach that collectively utilizes the disconnected datasets within the HHSC while respecting the privacy of the people in that data. Our scenario is an example of horizontal partitioning where datasets collected by each individual agency define the partitions. The model will be trained using only shelter stay data (i.e., records of when a person slept in a shelter). While many other data features (i.e., medical history, demographics, etc.) could potentially be useful predictors, these features are not uniformly collected since not everyone utilizing an HHSC consents to providing information about themselves. There is also a risk of bias if those who do consent to providing additional information become more readily identifiable by the machine learning model. Basing our methods on patterns of shelter use only ensures that our approach can be generalized across the widest possible number of HHSCs and is as equitable as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">A FL perspective is also required to label the examples in the historical shelter use dataset used to train and test our model. While many government definitions exist for chronic homelessness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Byrne and Culhane <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Messier, Tutty, and John <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, there are few established definitions for episodic homelessness. Instead, the accepted methodology for labeling a shelter use pattern as chronic, episodic, or transitional is based on the k-means cluster analysis of historical data records <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Culhane et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>; Aubry et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013a</a>; Kneebone et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. The k-means analysis assumes a person’s entire record of homelessness is available. This requires a merged dataset of all HHSC records, which is difficult to obtain, as noted above.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">The labeling process begins by using the historical shelter access records of a person to determine their number of stays and episodes. An <span id="Sx1.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">episode</span> is defined as a series of shelter stays with gaps of less than 30 days <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Byrne and Culhane <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. As shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the k-means algorithm is instructed to create 3 clusters on a scatter plot of the two above values of everyone in the training dataset. The transitional label is assigned to people associated with the low stay/low episode cluster. The episodic labels are assigned to the low stay/high episode and chronic labels are assigned to high stay/low episode clusters, respectively. Our paper will demonstrate how to create Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> using a federated approach that preserves privacy and does not require merging records.</p>

<p id="Sx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study utilizes anonymized shelter data provided by the Calgary Homeless Foundation (CHF). The protocol governing the anonymization, secure storage, and analysis of this secondary dataset was approved by the University of Calgary Conjoint Ethics Review Board (REB-19-0095). The CHF is an organization that provides and supports a data record system utilized by most of the housing and homelessness service agencies in Calgary, Canada. This allows the CHF to aggregate and merge records of service use for the same group of people accessing services across the system of care using privacy-preserving methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vatsalan, Christen, and Verykios <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>. As a result, the anonymized dataset used for this paper represents the <span id="Sx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Centralized</span> scenario described in the Introduction Section. The dataset stretches from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019 and contains timestamped records of when a person using the HHSC slept at an emergency shelter. There are 6,840,069 sleep records for 50,455 individuals accessing 8 different shelters.</p>

<p id="Sx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Restricting the machine learning model to predict episodic, chronic, and transitional shelter access patterns using sleep event data only is challenging. There are many other data features sometimes recorded by HHSC services that may be useful in a predictive model (i.e., demographic information, medical history, employment status, family relationships, etc.). However, it is important to stress that this information is not always collected. Demographic information may only be recorded when accessing certain programs. Low barrier-to-entry emergency shelters may not require clients to disclose any information to access sleep services on a cold night.
In contrast, a record of sleeping in a shelter is consistently and uniformly collected for all HHSC users. Focusing on this data feature ensures all people are represented equitably in the data. While specific data recording practices may vary between HHSCs, shelter sleep data is recorded by most, which means the methods presented in this paper can be easily adopted in many jurisdictions.</p>

The per class precision and recall for the FL case are in general much better than for local classes and fall in line with previous trends. This is quite important for this case because of the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset. As overall higher results shown before could have simply been attributed to a single class’s performance improvement. However, it is quite obvious that clients in all three classes are seeing the benefits of this improvement making the model even more fairer to use compared to the current local implementations.</p>

This shortfall can be explained by the per-agency Federated and Isolated scenario performance results presented in Table <a href="#Sx5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Comparing Centralized, Federated and Isolated Prediction ‣ Evaluation ‣ Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Each row in this table includes the agency ID number, the number of individuals in that agency’s dataset, and the precision and recall achieved by the Federated and Isolated scenarios.</p>

<p id="Sx5.SSx5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#Sx5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Comparing Centralized, Federated and Isolated Prediction ‣ Evaluation ‣ Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> demonstrates that it is the smaller shelters (shelters with capacity below 12,000) that perform particularly poorly in the Isolated case due to the very small size of their datasets. An exception to this trend is noted in the case of agency 213. Given its limited size (293 clients) and the consequently small test sample (approximately 70 clients), the results for this agency are deemed insufficient for a reliable evaluation of model performance and are considered an outlier.</p>

<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Before discussing the results in the Evaluation Section, it is important to provide context regarding how a machine learning tool should be utilized within an HHSC. As noted in the Introduction Section, machine learning should never be the only method for connecting people to housing. Instead, it is used as part of a range of programs for engaging with HHSC users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shinn and Richard <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, including “diversion” programs specifically designed for making contact with new HHSC entrants.</p>

<p id="Sx6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While improving the absolute performance of the models presented in the Evaluation Section is always desirable, these performance levels are acceptable if the models are used in the context of supporting a robust diversion program with human front-line staff. Performance could also be further improved if the methods in this paper are applied in an HHSC where other data features, such as demographic information, are collected.</p>

<div id="Sx6.SSx5.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx5.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The results from Table <a href="#Sx5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Comparing Centralized, Federated and Isolated Prediction ‣ Evaluation ‣ Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> show that the centralized model outperforms the other two models. The Centralized scenario is ideal and may be achievable in some HHSCs that have a centralized agency capable of collecting data, as is the case in Calgary. However, most HHSCs are better represented by the Isolated scenario where agencies would need to operate independently without collaboration. The Federated approach, as proposed in this paper, is posited as a viable compromise, offering a balance between prediction performance and minimizing the amount of centralized IT infrastructure required. It can also be implemented without requiring the people using the HHSC to provide consent to share data across agency boundaries.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Achieving Equity with Federated Learning</h4>

<div id="Sx6.SSx5.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx5.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One significant challenge within the HHSC network is the disparity in data analytics capabilities between large and small agencies. Smaller agencies often struggle with insufficient datasets. This limitation hampers their ability to identify at-risk clients accurately and tailor their services effectively. Looking at the results in Figure <a href="#Sx6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Discussion ‣ Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, it is quite clear that our federated model has a substantial gain in performance over the isolated case. A breakdown of the per agency performance keeping in mind the number of clients per agency in table <a href="#Sx5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Comparing Centralized, Federated and Isolated Prediction ‣ Evaluation ‣ Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows exactly where the federated model gains its performance. Notably, smaller shelters, those with fewer than 10,000 clients, which struggle to adequately train their models due to insufficient data, benefit markedly from the aggregated insights available through larger shelters. Conversely, larger shelters observed minimal performance gains, as their pre-existing data volumes were already sufficient to effectively train their models.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx6.SSx5.SSSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx5.SSSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The federated model presents a solution to this problem by enabling smaller agencies to leverage larger, aggregated models trained across multiple data sources without directly sharing sensitive information. FL allows for the collective improvement of model performance, benefiting all participants in the network. When using machine learning for social good, equity is important. This means that all people accessing an HHSC should benefit from the same high-quality tools regardless of whether they choose to interact with a large or small agency. The fact that our proposed FL approach benefits smaller agencies, in particular, shows it is an important tool for achieving this equity goal.</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Federated models reduce the need for data linkage</h4>

<div id="Sx6.SSx5.SSSx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.SSx5.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional approach to enhancing machine learning models across different agencies involves the linkage of data to create a centralized dataset. This process not only raises significant privacy concerns but also involves logistical complexities and substantial resources dedicated to ensuring the secure and accurate merging of sensitive information. The federated model offers a compelling advantage by eliminating the necessity for direct data linkage. By training models on decentralized data and aggregating the learned models, FL circumvents the challenges associated with data consolidation. This approach significantly reduces the complexity and cost associated with data linkage, reallocating those resources toward improving service delivery and operational efficiencies. Moreover, FL upholds the privacy and confidentiality of individual records, addressing one of the critical barriers to data sharing among agencies.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h2>

<div id="Sx7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, a critical gap in current homelessness management strategies is addressed by using a machine learning approach that respects the privacy and autonomy of individual agencies while leveraging data from across the HHSC. In jurisdictions where raw data sharing across agencies is challenged by privacy concerns or logistical challenges, our proposed FL model demonstrated virtually the same performance as that of a centralized data approach. Compared to the status quo in the domain, our federated approach greatly enhances the ability of smaller shelters to make predictions and also promotes equity across the HHSC. By demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of federated learning in this context, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development of ML applications within the social services sector.</p>
