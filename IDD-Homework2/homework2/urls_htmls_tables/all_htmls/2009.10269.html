<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework that can deal with the distributed issue in machine learning and still guarantee high learning performance.
However, it is impractical that all users will sacrifice their resources to join the FL algorithm.
This motivates us to study the incentive mechanism design for FL.
In this paper, we consider a FL system that involves one base station (BS) and multiple mobile users. The mobile users use their own data to train the local machine learning model, and then send the trained models to the BS, which generates the initial model, collects local models and constructs the global model.
Then, we formulate the incentive mechanism between the BS and mobile users as an auction game where the BS is an auctioneer and the mobile users are the sellers.
In the proposed game, each mobile user submits its bids according to the minimal energy cost that the mobile users experiences in participating in FL.
To decide winners in the auction and maximize social welfare, we propose the primal-dual greedy auction mechanism.
The proposed mechanism can guarantee three economic properties, namely, truthfulness, individual rationality and efficiency.
Finally, numerical results are shown to demonstrate the performance effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, according to the report of International Data Corporation, there are nearly 3 billions smart-phones on the world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which generate a huge amount of personal data.
Nowadays, mobile devices equipped with specialized hardware architectures and computing engines can handle the machine learning problem effectively.
In addition, the application of machine learning techniques in mobile devices has grown rapidly.
Furthermore, due to the limitation of wireless communication resources and privacy protection problem, the conventional central machine learning techniques, which upload all data of mobile devices to the central sever, are becoming less attractive.
For this reason, federated learning (FL) is promoted, which is implemented distributively at the edge of the network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In FL, mobile users can collaboratively train a global model using their own local data.
Mobile users compute the updates of the current global model, and then send back the updates to the central server for aggregation and build a new global model.
This process is repeated until an accuracy level of the global learning model is achieved.
By this way, FL can preserve the personal information and data of mobile users.
<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">In addition, FL will significantly promote services that have unparalleled versatile data collection and model training on a large scale.<span id="S1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> Take the app Ware as an example. This application can help the users in avoiding heavy traffic roads, but users have to share their own locations to the server. If FL is applied to this app, users only need to send the intermediate gradient values to the server rather than the raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Last but not least, the development of mobile edge computing provides an immense exposure to
extract the benefits of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In spite of the above mentioned benefits of FL, there are remaining challenges of having an efficient FL framework. Firstly, data samples per mobile device are small to train a high-quality learning model so a large number of mobile users are needed to ensure cooperation.
In addition, the mobile users who join the learning process are independent and uncontrollable.
Here, mobile users may not be willing to participate in the learning due to the energy cost incurred by model training.
In other words, the base station (BS), which generates the global model, has to stimulate the mobile users for participation.
Moreover, because the wireless resource is limited, the BS needs to allocate the resources reasonably to avoid the congestion, guarantee the model training performance and optimize the total utilities of the BS and mobile users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with the above challenges, in this paper, we model the FL service between the BS and mobile users as an auction game in which the BS is buyer and mobile users are sellers.
In particular, the BS first initiates and announces a FL task.
When each mobile user receives the FL task information, they decide the amount of resources required to participate in the model training.
After that, each mobile user submits a bid, which includes the required amount of resource, local accuracy, and the corresponding energy cost, to the BS.
<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text">
Moreover, the BS plays the role of auctioneer to decide the winners among mobile users as well as clear payment for the winning mobile users.
In addition, the auction used in this paper is a type of combinational auction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> since each mobile user can bid for combinations of resources.
However, the proposed auction mechanism allows mobile users sharing the resources at the BS, which is different from the conventional combinatorial auction.
The proposed mechanism directly determines the trading rules between the buyer (BS) and sellers (mobile users) and motivates the mobile users to participate in the model training.
Compared with other incentive mechanism approaches (e.g., contract theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>) in which the service market is a monopoly market, where mobile users can only decide whether or not to accept the contracts, the proposed auction enables mobile users to bids any combinations of resources.
Moreover, the proposed auction mechanism can simultaneously provide truthfulness and individual rationality.
An auction mechanism is truthful if a bidder’s utility does not increase when that bidder makes other bidding strategies, rather than the true value.
Revealing the true value is a dominant strategy for each participating user regardless of what strategies other users use<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
An absent-truthfulness auction mechanism could leave the door to possible market manipulation and produce inferior results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, if the value of any bidder is non-negative, an auction process will ensure individual rationality.<span id="S1.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the resource constraints and the heterogeneity of mobile users, some focus issues are resource allocation, client selection and incentive mechanism to improve the efficiency of FL.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> posed the joint learning and transmission energy minimization problem for FL.
In this paper, all users upload their learning model to the BS in a synchronous manner.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> also considered the latency and energy consumption minimization problem for the case of asynchronous transmission.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> explored the problem of reducing the learning loss function by considering packet errors over wireless links, but this research ignored the computation delay of the local learning model.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors suggested energy-efficient strategies for allocating bandwidth and scheduling while at the same time, guaranteeing learning efficiency.
The derived optimal policies allocate more bandwidth to those scheduled devices with weaker channels or lower computing capacities, which are the bottlenecks of synchronized model updates in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> overlooked the problem of client selection to build a high-quality machine learning model.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> designed a protocol called FedCS.
The FedCS protocol has a resource request phase to gather information such as computing power and wireless channel states from a subset of randomly selected clients, i.e., FL workers, that are able to finish the local training punctually.
A q-FedAvg training algorithm for selecting the client by the computational power was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
This proposed algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> can improve the training efficiency and solve the fairness issue.
The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> recommended combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and FL frameworks with mobile edge systems to optimize computing, caching and communication.
The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> jointly considered the device selection and beamforming fast global model aggregation.
They used the principle of over-the-air computation to exploit signal superposition multiple access channels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Concerning the incentive mechanism design, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed a Stackelberg game model to investigate the interactions between the server and the mobile devices in a cooperative relay communication network.
The mobile devices determine the price per unit of data for individual profit maximization, while the server chooses the size of training data to optimize its own profit.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> studied the block-chained FL architecture and proposed the contract theory based payment mechanism to incentivize the mobile devices to take part in the FL.
However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> largely provided a latency analysis for the related applications.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> designed and analyzed a novel crowdsourcing framework to enable FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a two-stage Stackelberg game model was adopted to jointly study the utility maximization of the participating clients and multi-access edge computing (MEC) server interacting via an application interface to construct a high-quality learning model.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, a Stackelberg game for FL in IoT was proposed to tackle the challenge of incentivizing people to join the FL by contributing their computational power and data.
For the cases where the knowledge of participants’ decisions and accurate contribution evaluation are accessible, the Nash Equilibrium was derived, and an algorithm based on DRL was built to unknown the knowledge of participants’ decisions and accurate contribution evaluation for the cases.
However, both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> studied only the uniform pricing scheme for participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the Stackelberg game and contract theory, the auction mechanism allows mobile users to actively report its cost. Therefore, the BS is capable of understanding their status and requests adequately.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> adopted the multi-dimensional procurement auction to motivate nodes to participate in FL.
However, there exist some differences between <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and our work: (a) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> the bids submitted by edge node clarifies the combination of resources and the expected payment, which is based on the private cost parameters while in our work, the bid declares the combination of resource, local accuracy and the cost, which is determined based on latency and energy cost models; (b) the winner selection in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> based on the scoring function announced by the aggregator while in our work, winners are selected in order to optimize social welfare and ensure resource efficiency.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.12" class="ltx_p">It is noted that the uplink from the users to the BS is used to transmit the parameters of the local FL model while the downlink is used for transmitting the parameters of the global FL model. In this paper, we just consider the uplink bandwidth allocation due to the relation of the uplink bandwidth and the cost that user experiences during learning a global model.
We consider the uplink transmission of an OFDMA-based cellular system.

It is also known that a mechanism with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) payment rule is truthful only when the resource allocation is optimal.

To deal with the NP-hard problem, we proposed the primal-dual based greedy algorithm. The following economic properties are desired.</p>

From line 13 of the Algorithm <a href="#alg4" title="In V-B Approximation Algorithm Design ‣ V Auction mechanism between BS and mobile users ‣ An Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning in Wireless Cellular network: An Auction Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, it is clear that a mobile user can increase its chance of winning by increasing its bid. Also, a mobile user can increase its chance to win by decreasing the weighted sum of the resources. Therefore, the winner determination algorithm is monotone with respect to mobile user’s bids. Moreover, the value of a winning bidder is equals to the minimum value it has to bid to win its bundle, i.e., its critical value. This is done by finding the losing bidder <math id="S5.SS5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S5.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">m</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS5.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑚</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS5.p1.1.m1.1c">m</annotation></semantics></math> who would win if bidder <math id="S5.SS5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S5.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS5.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS5.p1.2.m2.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> would not participate in the auction.

The lower bound is determined by the fractional optimal solution divided by gap when the number of mobile users varies from 10 to 50. We note that with the number of mobile users increasing, all schemes produce higher social welfare. This is because there is more chances to choose winning bids with the higher value. Although the social welfare obtained through the proposed greedy scheme is lower than through optimal solution and fractional optimal solution, it much higher than the lower bound.</p>

This is because when the basic price becomes too high, the sum of the price is higher than the valuation of the resources claimed in a bid. Moreover, the social welfare achieved by linear, sublinear and superlinear price schemes are lower than by the proposed greedy scheme. This proves our proposed auction scheme outperforms the fixed price scheme.</p>

We formulated the incentive problem between the BS and mobile users in the FL service market as the auction game with the objective of maximizing social welfare. Then, we presented the method for mobile users to decide the bids submitted to the BS so that mobile users can minimize the energy cost. We also proposed the iterative algorithm with low complexity. In addition, we proposed a primal-dual greedy algorithm to tackle the NP-hard winner selection problem. Finally, we showed that the proposed auction mechanism guarantee truthfulness, individual rationality and computation efficiency. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism where social welfare obtained by our proposed mechanism is <math id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="400\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn mathcolor="#000000" id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">400</mn><mo mathcolor="#000000" id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.2">400</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p1.1.1.m1.1c">400\%</annotation></semantics></math> larger than by the fixed price scheme.<span id="S7.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
