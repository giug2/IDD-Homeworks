<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Intelligent fault diagnosis is essential to safe operation of machinery. However, due to scarce fault samples and data heterogeneity in field machinery, deep learning based diagnosis methods are prone to over-fitting with poor generalization ability. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a personalized federated learning framework, enabling multi-task fault diagnosis method across multiple factories in a privacy-preserving manner. Firstly, rotating machines from different factories with similar vibration feature data are categorized into machine groups using a federated clustering method. Then, a multi-task deep learning model based on convolutional neural network is constructed to diagnose the multiple faults of machinery with heterogeneous information fusion.
Finally, a personalized federated learning framework is proposed to solve data heterogeneity across different machines using adaptive hierarchical aggregation strategy.
The case study on collected data from real machines verifies the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The result shows that the diagnosis accuracy could be improved significantly using the proposed personalized federated learning, especially for those machines with scarce fault samples.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, with the increasing safety level of the whole society, major accidents caused by the failure of industrial equipment have attracted more and more attention. Especially in the fields related to petrochemical and energy, safety accidents caused by rotating machinery failure occur frequently.
The failure and shutdown of rotating machinery will lead to the suspension of the whole production line and bring huge economic losses.
Intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery can detect, identify and locate faults in time before they deteriorate. It is very important to ensure the safe and reliable operation of rotating machinery, and helpful to optimize maintenance strategy and spare parts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the collected vibration sensor data, many intelligent fault diagnosis methods have been proposed for rotating machinery using artificial intelligent algorithms, such as extreme learning machine <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Isham et al. <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, convolutional neural networks (CNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, long short-term memory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cao et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and generative adversarial networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang, Wang, and Wang <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.
However, the above methods need to train an independent model for each machine and have poor generalization ability, since the data distribution varies across machines due to the difference in machine structure and working conditions.
To address this problem, transfer learning and domain adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> are introduced into fault diagnosis area.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, most of the existing transfer learning methods can only deal with the variation of working conditions including rotating speed and load. When applied to the fault diagnosis of multiple machines, these methods still need large amounts of fault samples covering all fault types to support the training process, which cannot be satisfied in many real industrial applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.
In the actual industrial field, although there are many machines, most of them rarely have faults.
Meanwhile, the fault data of a machine is scarce and cannot cover all types of the faults that may happen. Therefore, it is difficult to accomplish model training or transfer learning with the data of a machine <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hang, Yang, and Xing <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
It is a feasible choice to use the data of different machines or even different factories to jointly build the model in a centralized data center. However, due to data privacy, many factories are reluctant to contribute the original sensor data, especially the fault samples, even if they are owned by the same entity.
Meanwhile, the vibration data is sampled at high sampling frequency, and the data volume is large. Centralizing the data of multiple factories will consume a lot of IoT and data storage costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, a novel paradigm to build AI models, can learn the knowledge from multiple participants while protecting the data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Konečný et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Federated learning allows multiple participants to train the model locally, and then aggregate the model updates without requiring participants to send the data to the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tan et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, the vanilla federated learning framework that builds a global model may not be effective for all participants due to the data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, and thus, personalized federated learning with novel aggregation strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu, He, and Chen <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> becomes a hot research topic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, to address the problem of scarce fault samples and heterogeneous data across factories, this paper proposes a personalized federated learning framework for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Based on the similarity of time and frequency domain features extracted from the vibration signals, the rotating machines from multiple factories are categorized into machine groups using federated clustering algorithm. Then, a deep learning based fault diagnosis model composed of common feature exaction block and personalized multi-task classification block is constructed with the vibration features as inputs. Finally, a personalized federated learning framework is proposed through the adaptive aggregation of common feature extraction layer trained by all machines and the adaptive aggregation of personalized multi-task classification block for individual machine groups.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fault diagnosis across the machines is a challenging work in real industrial scenarios due to the difference in data distribution. Therefore, transfer learning and domain adaptation methods are introduced to improve the performance of fault diagnosis models.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhu, Chen, and Shen <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> develops a new deep transfer learning based CNN to address the problem of transfer fault diagnosis under different working conditions.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, a deep adversarial transfer learning network is proposed for new emerging fault detection of target domain.
A distance metric named polynomial kernel induced maximum mean discrepancy is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> to reuse diagnosis knowledge from one machine to the other.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the above-mentioned methods still need complete training data of all fault types in both source domain and target domain, and cannot be guaranteed in practical implement.
To reduce the dependence on data, a domain generalization framework Whitening-Net is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> for the fault diagnosis across different machines and conditions based on causal mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although the above methods can obtain good results in transfer learning across machines, an independent model needs to be trained for each machine, which is inefficient in practical implementation. Federated learning uses the data from multiple participants while protecting the privacy, and is able to train a unified model using the knowledge of all participants.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposes a fault diagnosis method based on federated learning and CNN, which allows different industrial participants to collaboratively train a global fault diagnosis model without sharing their local data.
However, the vanilla federated learning method cannot deal with data heterogeneity across the machines, as all participants share a single global model with the same model parameters. To address this problem, a clustered federated learning approach is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sattler, Müller, and Samek <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> to deal with distributions divergence of clients data by clustering clients based on cosine similarity.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu, He, and Chen <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposes personalized federated learning framework in a cloud-edge architecture for intelligent IoT applications to cope with the heterogeneity issues in IoT environments.
Therefore, to address the current issues in practical machinery fault diagnosis, it is urgent to introduce personalized federated learning into the field of machinery fault diagnosis, and put forward a novel framework according to the characteristics of machinery faults.</p>

Then, federated clustering is proceeded to categorize machines across factories into machine groups based on the similarity of their time frequency indices. The personalized federated learning is carried out between similar machine groups across factories by adaptive hierarchical aggregation, which means the data of all machines are used to train the common feature extraction block, and the data of machines in each group are used to train the multi-task classification block for the similar machine group. Finally, in the online implementation, the faults of a machine can be diagnosed by the model composed of common feature extraction block and the multi-task classification block of its similar machine group.</p>

From the spectrum, the 1X, 2X and 3X amplitudes of the rotating frequency is obvious, which is the symptom of misalignment fault.
The CWT can show the non-stationary vibration characteristics in time-frequency domain, which is usually helpful in the diagnosis of bearing fault that generates intermittent impact components in the vibration signal.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since CNN has been proved to be an effective model for processing vibration signals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tang, Yuan, and Zhu <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, a CNN-based fault diagnosis model for rotating machinery is constructed in this paper. Considering the domain knowledge of signal processing, spectrum is sensitive to the fault related to rotor, such as unbalance and misalignment, while the impact signal caused by bearing fault is obvious on the CWT.
Therefore, the original vibration signal, spectrum and CWT are used as the input of the fault diagnosis model simultaneously. Then a common feature extraction block is constructed to process multi-dimensional heterogeneous information input. At the same time, according to the fault types to be diagnosed, a multi-task classification block with multiple outputs is constructed for multiple faults.</p>

Conv represents the CNN block that consists of convolutional layer, activation layer and pooling layer. Vibration data of three channels in different sampling frequencies are used as the input of deep learning model.
Input 1, input 2 and input 3 are original vibration signals of the three channels.
Input 4, input 5 and input 6 are spectrums of signals.
Input 7, input 8 and input 9 are CWT of signals.
Each type of data input is processed by two or three convolutional layers to obtain the feature maps in the same size. Then, the feature maps are concatenated for further feature extraction.
In the multi-task classification block, several fully connected batches are built to obtain the occurrence conditions of multiple faults, respectively.
In the case study of this paper, four fault types, i.e., unbalance, misalignment, bearing and friction, are considered.

It is assumed that Factory A and Factory B are the two factories participating in federated learning.
Supposing all the machines are divided into two similar machine groups. For each factory, two agents are built, corresponding to two similar machine groups.
For each agent of each factory, the data of the machines corresponding to the same similar machine group in the factory are summarized to training the same local model.
Compared with training a local model for the data of each machine, this method reduces the transmission of model parameters in the network, especially in the case of a large number of machines.
For agents belonging to the same similar machine group in all factories, model aggregation is carried out by a variant of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> (as described in next subsection).

<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">During the training of the personalized federated framework, two agents are created in each factory corresponding to the two similar machine groups. The data of the machines in each group of each factory are summarized in the training process, e.g. the data of machine 1 and machine 2 are summarized in factory A for the training of the same local model.
Then the local models of the 6 agents are aggregated hierarchically with the adaptive aggregation rates.
Specifically, the common feature extraction blocks of all 6 local models are aggregated to obtain the global common feature extraction block. The multi-task classification blocks of model A1, B1 and C1 are aggregated to obtain the multi-task classification block for similar machine group 1, and the multi-task classification blocks of model A2, B2 and C2 are aggregated to obtain the multi-task classification block for similar machine group 2.</p>

<p id="S4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The training of the personalized federated learning framework is carried out on a server with a P1000 GPU. The federated learning sever and agents are simulated by multi-threading in <span id="S4.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Python</span> environment. The deep learning model based on CNN is realized by <span id="S4.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Tensorflow</span>.
The data of all machines are divided into five datasets for 5-fold cross validation, which means each training experiment takes four datasets as training data and the rest dataset as test data. The training of each combination of datasets takes about 1000 epochs to obtain convergence in about eight hours.

<p id="S4.p8.1" class="ltx_p">From Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4 Case Study ‣ Personalized Federated Learning for Multi-task Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, it can be seen that all the machines obtain accurate fault diagnosis results for all fault after personalized federated learning, even when the fault rate is very low, such as the fault 4 of machine 12. The machine with more fault data obtains higher diagnosis accuracy. The recall rates of all machines and fault types remain high, which is very helpful to find the occurrence of fault in real time.</p>

<p id="S4.p9.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, two common methods for fault diagnosis of multiple rotating machines are used to compared with the proposed framework. Single machine method builds a fault diagnosis model for each machine using its own data only. Vanilla federated learning (Vanilla FL) method aggregates the local model of all machines as a single global model. Moreover, clustering FL, which is implemented by training a model for each similar machine group, is also proposed in this paper for comparison.</p>

It can be seen that the personalized FL framework obtains higher diagnosis accuracies than the other two methods for most machines and faults. The vanilla FL method fails to improve the diagnosis accuracy than single machine models, since it cannot deal with the data heterogeneity. Considering the data heterogeneity, personalized FL trains personalized fault diagnosis models for machines by the means of federated clustering and hierarchical aggregation, which improves the generality of the models. Therefore, personalized FL improves the diagnosis accuracies greatly when the fault rates of the training data are low, e.g. fault 1 of machine 9 and fault 3 of machine 12, and maintains the diagnosis accuracies when the fault data in the training set of a machine is enough to train a good model.</p>

Meanwhile, the improvement decreases while the fault rate increasing. When the fault samples are sufficient, the single machine model might be good enough and the improvements of all FL methods become marginal. In other words, federated learning is beneficial for the factories having machines with scarce fault samples, which is very common especially for the newly installed machines.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a personalized federated learning framework is proposed for multi-task fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The machines from different factories are clustered into similar machine groups according to the features of their vibration signals without compromising data privacy. Based on the multi-task fault diagnosis model constructed, the personalized federated learning is carried out by aggregating the common feature extraction block of all local model of machines and aggregating the multi-task classification block in each similar machine group.
The case study on the machines from different factories shows the advantages of the proposed clustering and personalized federated learning methods, over the single machine model and vanilla federated learning methods in terms of higher diagnosis accuracy for all types of failures investigated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, incentive mechanism will be further studied to encourage factories joining personalized federated learning using monetary of non-monetary schemes, and thus to build a prosperous ecosystem having sufficient machines with similar data and fault samples for achieving higher diagnosis accuracy and the corresponding business value.</p>
