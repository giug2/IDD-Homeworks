<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has recently received a lot of attention for large-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication overheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL.
To mitigate the communication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local update of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and computation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between communication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and balancing those two trade-offs <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">jointly and dynamically</span> while considering their impacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises significantly faster FL.
In this paper, we first formulate our problem to minimize learning error with respect to two variables: <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local update coefficients</span> and <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sparsity budgets</span> of gradient compression who characterize trade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We then derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time considering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL), that jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning error.
We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster than similar schemes existing in the literature.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated
Learning (FL) is a training paradigm where a large number of workers collectively train a model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Each worker holds a local (often private) training dataset, with which it contributes to training a global model. Specifically, in each FL round, each worker computes the error of the global model by forward-propagating the samples of its own dataset through the model, followed by comparing the model’s outputs with samples’ labels and applying an appropriate loss function. By backpropagating this error, each worker calculates the gradients. All workers then send their gradients to the server, who updates the global model and sends the updated model back to all the workers. At this point, one FL round is completed. After a number of (FL) rounds, the global model converges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL has recently become popular for the following reasons: (i) FL enables privacy-preserving training as workers only share their gradients with the server. That is, FL makes it possible to train a model from the entire datasets of workers without any individuals having to reveal their local datasets to other workers or the server. This characteristic of FL technology renders it apposite to many applications, the most popular of which is Internet of Things (IoT) where the data from organizations, hospitals, homes (Smart Home), and vehicles (Internet of Vehicles) presumably needs to be collected for processing, inference, and decision-making <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. FL removes the need to collect the raw data in using machine learning for IoT, thereby it ameliorates the privacy of IoT. (ii) FL is an exemplar of Edge Intelligence, which is the offspring from the union of (mobile) Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Edge Intelligence advocates for pushing the intelligence down from clouds to the proximity of end-users by implementation of AI applications on edge-devices<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>While some papers in literature of FL use the term “edge-device” as to refer to the nodes at which the gradients are calculated, in this paper, we prefer to use the term “worker.”</span></span></span>, thereby promising better privacy and reliability with lower latency and cost. FL, correspondingly, can be used to facilitate training of large-scale models by parallelizing the computation of gradients on edge-devices. Moreover, FL allows inference to be performed on edge-devices, and thus, fulfills the goals of Edge Intelligence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. (iii) FL addresses the intelligence democratization issue: in the AI market, big companies possessing a large amount of data plus computational and storage facilities can get the monopoly of AI businesses while small firms have no chances in this competition. FL enables small businesses to play a role in the market as they do not require a massive amount of data at a datacenter, nor computational and storage facilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, the empirical speedup (for training) offered by FL often fails to meet the optimal scaling (in the number of workers) that is ideally desired. It is now widely acknowledged that this speedup saturation is mainly due to the communication overheads, which are largely attributed to frequent gradient transmissions from workers to the server. As the number of parameters in the state-of-the-art models scales to a huge number (e.g., hundreds of millions), the size of the gradients scales proportionally. The communication bottleneck becomes even more pronounced particularly when the workers performing FL are wireless devices (e.g., smartphones and sensors) which communicate through wireless channels and suffer from low-bandwidth, intermittent connections, and expensive mobile data plans <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. To mitigate the communication overhead problem and hence speedup learning, in the literature, two main techniques have been studied. The first is local update, characterizing the trade-off between communication and computation, and the second is gradient compression, characterizing the trade-off between communication and precision. Each of these techniques will be discussed in the following.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the local update technique, within each round, many local updates are performed—instead of only one update. Local update presents a communication-computation trade-off as <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local update coefficient</span> determines the ratio of computation to communication. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> showed that local updates can significantly alleviate frequent gradient transmissions. Formulating the error-convergence bound in terms of local updates, Adaptive Communication (ADACOMM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> dynamically optimized the local update coefficients to accelerate convergence while retaining accuracy. ADACOMM also showed that the communication-computation trade-off introduced by local update coefficients should be dynamically balanced over the course of learning. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the same issue was addressed, but assuming that the loss function was convex. Performing binary compression and benefiting from local updates, Sparse Binary Compression (SBC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> could significantly decrease communication overheads.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Gradient compression presents the communication-precision trade-off, i.e., how much compression is productive in different rounds? Gradient compression methods fall into two categories: gradient quantization and sparsification. Gradient quantization approaches the problem of communication overhead by sending a compressed (quantized) version of the gradient. TernGrad <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> used 2 bits for each element of the gradient and authors mathematically proved the convergence of TernGrad under the assumption of a bound on gradients. Quantized SGD (QSGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> investigated the effects of 2 bits, 4 bits, and 8 bits quantizations on different layers of neural networks and showed that the networks converge. Authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> even went further and quantized the gradients to one bit. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, similar quantization techniques were exploited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.2" class="ltx_p">Sparsification technique aims to sparsify gradients in order to send only the significant elements of the gradients instead of all. Sparsification techniques fall into two categories depending on in what domain the sparsity is sought for. Some researchers assume that gradients are sparse in their original domain while others find some transformed domains more appropriate. Following the first approach, the scheme proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> sparsified gradients by setting insignificant entries to zero, where insignificant entries were those entries whose values were between top <math id="S1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.05\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">0.05</mn><mo id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2">0.05</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1c">0.05\%</annotation></semantics></math> and bottom <math id="S1.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.05\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">0.05</mn><mo id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.2">0.05</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1c">0.05\%</annotation></semantics></math>. The authors then used run-length codes to encode the gradients before sending them to the server. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a similar scheme was studied.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The second approach for sparsification aims to find another domain for gradients in which they are more sparse than their original domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, gradients were transformed to the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) domain to discover/exploit more sparsity helping to mitigate the communication overheads. Also, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> stated that TernGrad <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and QSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> were special versions of their proposed scheme under certain circumstances. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proved why in general, big matrices are often low-rank.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, each of the aforementioned techniques, i.e., local updates and gradient compression, has been <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">individually</span> demonstrated to mitigate the communication overheads in FL, leading to considerable speedups.
Specifically, dynamically determining local update coefficients to balance the communication-computation trade-off has been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, but without considering any compression of gradients. Meanwhile, <span id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">static</span> gradient compression (communication-precision trade-off) has been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, but without dynamically adjusting local update coefficients. Based on these works, it is expected that conjoining the two techniques would be even more effective in reducing the communication overheads, thereby accelerating FL. To the best of our knowledge, however, studying and balancing those two trade-offs <span id="S1.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">jointly and dynamically</span> while considering their impacts on convergence (from both theoretical and empirical perspectives) have not been done in the literature. This unexplored, yet important problem motivated our work.

approaches have been used for the global aggregation at the server: gradient-averaging and weight-averaging. The former requires each worker to send the computed gradients to the server, whereas in the latter weights themselves are transmitted. In this paper, we use gradient-averaging because gradients are far more sparse than weights in almost any domain. This helps to reduce the communication overhead, which is the main challenge of FL.</span></span></span><span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>If weight-averaging <span id="footnote3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">were</span> adopted, the workers <span id="footnote3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">would</span> transmit the latest weights.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Achieving “fast FL” is the main concern of our proposed scheme. However, achieving “fast FL” and “communication-efficient FL” should not be conflated: although these two objectives overlap/correlate in practice, they are still different at a conceptual/theoretical level. Achieving fast FL requires communication-efficiency; but, it is not limited to it. For achieving fast FL, every time-consumer should be taken into account: (i) downlink communication time from the server to the workers, (ii) time for local training of neural networks (i.e., computation time) at the workers, and (iii) uplink communication time from workers to the server. In a special case, when the communication data rate is low, the communication time becomes the dominant time-consumer—and the bottleneck. In such a case, “achieving fast FL” <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">reduces</span> to “achieving communication-efficient FL.”</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The problem of achieving “fast FL” can be framed as to jointly and dynamically find balances considering the two inherent trade-offs: (i) communication-computation and (ii) communication-precision. The first trade-off is characterized by the local update coefficient <math id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau_{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">τ</mi><mi id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜏</ci><ci id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\tau_{k}</annotation></semantics></math>, for which striking a balance matters because one extreme (high communication and low computation) slows the convergence whereas the other extreme compromises the accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; either way, the learning is decelerated. The second trade-off is characterized by the sparsity budget of gradient compression where seeking a balance is imperative since high compression/imprecision (one extreme) stalls the learning process while no compression incurs heavy/unnecessary communication overheads. Having that framing of the problem in mind, (in Section <a href="#S3" title="III Problem Formulation and the Error Upper Bound Analysis ‣ Fast Federated Learning by Balancing Communication Trade-Offs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>) we will mathematically formulate our problem to minimize the learning error in a given wall-clock time with respect to local update coefficient and sparsity budget of gradient compression.</p>

Conjoining local update and gradient compression presents four theoretical challenges, which are addressed in our paper: (i) gradient compression must be unbiased to ensure convergence of the learning, which is the same condition that we have for SGD to be an unbiased estimation of Full-batch Gradient Descent (FGD). (ii) The variance between compressed gradient and uncompressed gradient must be made as small as possible because this way it has been shown that the learning is accelerated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. (iii) The communication time has to be written in terms of sparsity budget as it becomes dependent on the sparsity budget of gradient compression. (iv) Gradient compression induces a variance<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>The gradient compressor we are using in this paper is a probabilistic compressor whose mean is the same as the uncompressed gradient (unbiased).

Note that SGD itself has a variance from FGD. We need to merge these two variances.</p>

Interestingly, FFL is similar to Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> in three aspects: (i) in FFL, we have <span id="S4.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">workers</span> who posses their own datasets (with different distributions) while in MAML, there are <span id="S4.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">tasks</span> with their corresponding datasets. (ii) In FFL, we have <span id="S4.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local updates</span> that improve performances (loss/accuracy) of individual workers whereas in MAML, there are <span id="S4.p8.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">inner-loop updates</span> that do so for individual tasks. (iii) In FFL, in each round, we apply <span id="S4.p8.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global gradient</span> to weights, which improves the overall performance of all workers while in MAML, the <span id="S4.p8.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">outer-loop update</span> does so for all of tasks. Meanwhile, FFL is dissimilar to MAML in three facets: (i) FFL compresses <span id="S4.p8.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local aggregated gradients</span> while MAML does not. (ii) FFL dynamically adjusts the local updates whereas MAML keeps the number of inner-loop updates fixed. (iii) In FFL, we only have <span id="S4.p8.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">one</span> update with global gradient while MAML can have multiple outer-loop updates. This coincidental similarity between FFL and MAML is promising as MAML has shown considerable success in <span id="S4.p8.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">accelerating</span> adaptation/generalization to different environments/tasks and the objective of FFL is achieving <span id="S4.p8.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fast</span> FL by balancing trade-offs between communication and computation/precision.</p>

<p id="S4.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In practical applications, our proposed scheme (Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="In IV Proposed FL Scheme: FFL ‣ Fast Federated Learning by Balancing Communication Trade-Offs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) is implemented in the following steps: (i) each worker sends a participation signal to the server that serves as a participation request/permission. (ii) When the server, via referring to its database, approves (the reliability/trustworthiness of) the worker, it sends the latest weights as well as the local update coefficient and sparsity budget to the worker. The local update coefficient determines the number of gradient computations before communication, while the sparsity budget defines the rate of compression at which the worker is supposed to compress the gradients prior to communication. This way, the worker is synchronized with the FL system. (iii) The workers then, in each round, continuously compute gradients as many times as the local update coefficient allows and those workers transmit the compressed gradients at the compression rate that is specified by the sparsity budget. (iv) The server, meanwhile, receives the compressed gradients from the workers and computes the average gradient with which it updates the global weights. Later, the server jointly optimizes the local update coefficient and sparsity budget (via Theorem 6) for the upcoming round based on the latest loss value. The updated weights as well as the optimal local update coefficient and sparsity budget are then broadcast to workers.</p>

Specifically, our scheme FFL uses the SVD compression while ADACOMM, which is one of our baselines, does not—ATOMO which is the other baseline does. This additional computation time of FFL that is spent for SVD compression causes computation part of each round of FFL to take slightly longer time compared to ADACOMM. Nonetheless, the SVD compression substantially reduces communication overheads, thereby saving considerable amount of time in compensation. Therefore, the overall time taken for a round is shorter in our scheme. This trade-off, which is spending time for computation in order to compress the gradients, is significantly time-saving because usually it is the communication time that is the bottleneck. Also, the amount of time spent for computation required for SVD compression is negligible compared to the gradient computation that includes performing <math id="S5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">τ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝜏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1c">\tau</annotation></semantics></math> number of local updates.</p>

<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We plot variations of desired parameters (e.g., accuracy) against wall-clock time instead of FL rounds, epochs, or iterations. This is because unlike traditional centralized learning where different iterations take almost the same time and therefore the number of iterations reflects the speed of convergence, for FL that does not hold. The convergence speed of FL is determined by two factors: (i) the number of rounds and (ii) the time spent for each round that can <span id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">significantly</span> differ over time because each round comprises (a) a downlink broadcast of global weights from the server to the workers with different link speeds (different delays), (b) local gradient computations that are again dependent on many factors such as the number of local updates and hardware heterogeneity, and finally, (c) transmissions of the compressed gradients to the server by workers whose delays depend on compression ratios and uplink speeds. Hence, simply reporting the number of rounds is neither informative nor conclusive for the speed of convergence.</p>

However, we should not overshoot: the size of the mini-batch must be just as large as to ensure that the mini-batch is fairly representative. As soon as representative-ness of the mini-batch is achieved, increasing the mini-batch size further only consumes dispensable resources—the other extreme. Because a larger mini-batch size proportionately demands larger memory and more computation which might be unaffordable particularly for resource-constranied IoT nodes and edge-devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Interestingly, determining the mini-batch size itself involves balancing an inherent communication-computation trade-off: a too small mini-batch size (which translates to too little computation per communication) prolongs/cripples the learning, whereas an unnecessarily large mini-batch size (too much computation per communication) slows the learning.</p>

In such a case, not only compression is not that important in reducing the overall delay but also it can be detrimental due to its introduction of a compression time/delay. Indeed, here computation has become more of a bottleneck than communication. Expectedly, in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ V Experiments ‣ Fast Federated Learning by Balancing Communication Trade-Offs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a>, ADACOMM is outperforming ATOMO despite its employment of compression. In this case, FFL approaches the performance of ADACOMM, even though FFL benefits from compression. Since employing compression is no longer the primary contributor in reducing the convergence time; what here plays the role instead is whether a scheme is using local updates or not. However, FFL is still outperforming ADACOMM due to a slight benefit it is taking from compression. Albeit, when uplink/downlink data rates approach infinity, ADACOMM would grow closer to FFL because the communication time of each round would approach zero and then it would not matter whether we compress gradients or not.

In this case, the schemes which compress the gradients in the uplink win the race. Also, it can be seen that FFL has a slight advantage over ATOMO thanks to local updates.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, our goal was to accelerate FL via minimizing learning error in a given wall-clock time with respect to local updates and gradient compression that correspond to trade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. To this end, we first derived an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time considering the interdependency between the two variables: local update coefficient and sparsity budget. Based on this theoretical analysis, we then proposed an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL), which jointly and dynamically adjusted the two variables to achieve <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fast</span> FL. In experiments, we demonstrated that FFL consistently achieved higher accuracies faster than similar schemes in the literature.</p>
