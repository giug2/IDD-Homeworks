<p id="id19.id1" class="ltx_p">With the increase of intelligent devices leading to increasing demand for traffic, traffic offloading has become a challenging problem. The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is a superior network architecture to solve this problem. The existing research on SAGIN traffic offloading only considers the single-layer satellite network in the space network. To further expand the resource pool of traffic offloading in SAGIN, we extend the single-layer satellite network into a double-layer satellite network composed of low-orbit satellites (LEO) and high-orbit satellites (GEO). And re-model a four-layer SAGIN architecture consisting of the ground network, the air network, LEO and GEO. Furthermore, we propose a novel Federated Soft Actor-Critic (FeSAC) traffic offloading method with positive environmental exploration to accommodate this dynamic and complex four-layer SAGIN architecture. The FeSAC method uses federated learning to train traffic offloading nodes and then aggregate the training results to obtain the best traffic offloading strategy. The simulation results show that under the four-layer SAGIN, our proposed method can better adapt to the network environment changes by nodes mobility and is better than the existing traffic offloading methods in throughput, packet loss, and transmission delay.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The optimized decision making is the critical challenge in the Cyber-physical system, especially in the next generation network of B5G/6G with highly dynamic and large-scale environment.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is one kind of machine learning technology to optimize decision making by maximizing the cumulative reward with the continuously exploring and exploiting the environment of an agent.
Using RL to obtain network optimization strategies is a current research hotspot in the field of modern networks, e.g., network resources allocation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and traffic control<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, traditional RL applications still suffer from critical problems in scenarios with complex environment. For example, the local strategy trap problem when the network environment goes into dynamic and heterogeneous.
The local strategy trap is the situation ill-informed decision is inferred by incomplete information in local without fully considering the global environment changing.
”Carving a boat and seeking a lost sword” is a traditional story in China that insinuating such situation of local strategy trap.
Due to the features of high dynamic and heterogeneous of the complex networks, the local strategy trap occurs frequently in network scenarios such as IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, vehicular network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and SAGIN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an advanced learning technology train a shared learning model without raw training data by considering the privacy of distributed devices in complex environment.
By combining with both RL and FL, a privacy-preserving multi-agent collaboration approach referred to as Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) is proposed.
In FRL, each agent trains the data separately, aggregates it into a uniform global policy model, and then distributes it to the agents, ensuring user’s data privacy as much as possible while integrating local learning result from each agent.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The local strategy trap problem is solved to some extent by the shared training manner of FRL as the global information is implicitly shared during the integrated learning process.
Naturally, the FRL is widely considered as the potential solution widely used in the network optimization problem and proved to be somehow efficient in the heterogeneous networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, The global sharing based FRL employing global learning model for local inference may still fall into the local strategy trap.
The accuracy of using the global learning model for local inference is ensured by the assumption that the environments of diverse devices are homologous with same state transition probability, which is not practical as the considered state transition probability is always differentiation in the heterogeneous environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">For example, a dynamic and heterogeneous space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), consisting of satellites, UAVs, ground-based stations in different regions, and user devices.
In such a network environment, there is significant dynamism and heterogeneity among regions due to the high-speed movement of nodes, the extensive range of data transmission, and the convergence between different types of networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
The differentiation between regions is generally due to network state differences, sample distribution differences, and dynamic characteristic differences.
These discrepancies lead to the global policy model obtained by the aggregation of agents in each region can only be suboptimal compared to the optimal policy in each region.
It isn’t easy to obtain a uniform global policy model that performs well in all differentiated regions using the traditional FRL approach.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FeSAC: Federated Learning-Based Soft Actor-Critic Traffic Offloading in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, traditional FRL distributes a uniform global learning model to each region.
When there are differentiations in the environment of each region, the decisions inferred by the global learning model may be misjudged.
Therefore, considering the differentiations between regions in complex network environments, we propose a novel differentiated federated reinforcement learning (DFRL) approach.
Instead of seeking a uniform global policy model, DFRL enables agents across regions to cooperate in training their respective policy models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Precisely, the cooperation among the agents in each region is accomplished through the global trend model.
The global trend model is generated by aggregating the trend model developed by all the agents involved in the cooperation, reflecting the state of the environment and its changing trend in each region.
Then, under the guidance of the global trend model, the agents in each region get their local policy models by training with local data. The introduction of the global trend model allows agents to consider each region’s differentiations based on the information from multiple regions to obtain local strategies that are more applicable to their regions.</p>

In recent years, researchers have proposed several solutions to the challenges faced in FL.
For example, to obtain higher communication efficiency, McMahan et al. proposed FedAVG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which is now widely used as the baseline for FL research.
To address the heterogeneity problem in FL, Yuan, Dinh, and Ruan et al. proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, respectively, to solve data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, and device heterogeneity.
Moreover, the convergence of the FL method is further analyzed by Qu et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
They demonstrate the convergence of the FedAVG method in several differentiated scenarios and perform a comprehensive study of its convergence rate.
These work provides a solid foundation for federated learning in further research.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning (ML).
Compared with other machine learning methods such as supervised or unsupervised learning methods, RL generates samples and learns through these samples through constant interaction between the agent and the environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
The RL is widely used for communication and networking optimization in various networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
However, when the environment gets bigger, it becomes difficult for a single agent to complete the complex task in these scenarios due to constraints such as information processing capabilities or learning efficiency.
The natural idea is to set up multiple agents in the environment and complete the task by cooperating among them.
As a result, researchers have proposed distributed RL and parallel RL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, but they also bring the risk of agent privacy leakage.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Using traditional FRL algorithms in large-scale dynamic heterogeneous networks will face several problems.
First, in the real world, the data distribution of different agents in the environment is non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) due to the existence of implicit unknown parameters.
Traditional FRL algorithms use the global model as the center to aggregate information from all agents for learning.
However, such a learning approach is designed for IID data, which conflicts with non-IID data in dynamic heterogeneous networks and will leads to the local strategy trap.
Second, in the traditional FRL algorithm, agents periodically train models and upload them to the federated center node for aggregation.
Although this direct sharing of models with other agents compensates for the lack of efficiency in sampling and learning of a single agent, it faces the risk of stealing key models by malicious nodes.
A standard solution is using cryptography to protect the shared models, which introduces additional computational overhead and may reduce model accuracy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Third, each agent in the environment may have different policy preferences caused by the differentiations in network structure or network dynamics in the area where the agent is located.
It is difficult for traditional FRL algorithms to combine these differentiations to obtain a global model that satisfies the preferences of all agents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above issues, we define this large-scale dynamic heterogeneous network as a differentiated environment consisting of a series of dynamically heterogeneous local environments.
We propose the novel concept of Differentiated Federated Reinforcement Learning (DFRL) for such differentiated environment as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV Algorithms: Differentiated Federated Soft Actor-Critic ‣ FeSAC: Federated Learning-Based Soft Actor-Critic Traffic Offloading in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. To conquer the above challenges, the main improvement between DFRL and FRL is that DFRL isolates the local learning from global learning process. We at first divide the local learning model of agent into two parts: the trend model and the policy model. During training, agents only need to share knowledge with other agents by sharing the global trend model. Specifically, the policy model generates policies based on the local environment state which is isolated and never shared with other agents.
The trend model is the window to communicate and to be shared with center node during global learning process. The trend model is constructed with local trend model and the global trend model. The local trend model is responsible for describing the local environment state, changing trends, and guiding the update of the policy model. The global trend model is generated by the local trend model and shared among all agents, which is responsible for describing the state of the global environment, changing trends, and transferring the knowledge learned by all the agents. In addition, the global trend model continuously adjusts the local trend model during the interactive updating process. After the interactive, the policy model is jointly updated by both historical local state-policy pairs and the local trend model, which keeps the local variability as well as learning the implicit trend of the global environment.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The introduction of the trend model separates the learning of policy models, thus alleviating the non-IID of data and corresponding local strategy trap problem and avoiding the risk of leakage of key policy models during the communication transfer. Most importantly, this allows agents to cooperate in obtaining policy models that satisfy their preferences. In the next section, we describe the concept of DFRL in the context of specific algorithms.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we propose a novel DFRL algorithm called Federated Soft Actor-Critic (FeSAC), which introduces the concept of Differentiated Federated Reinforcement Learning (DFRL) based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Compared with the traditional federated reinforcement learning algorithm, this algorithm can better adapt to the variability between the environments in which the agents are located.
Then, we construct a set of differentiated OpenAI Gym environments<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> to verify the algorithm’s performance in heterogeneous environments.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to data heterogeneity and node dynamics, the traditional FRL algorithm is not capable to handle the cooperated learning tasks in differentiated environments.
Therefore, we propose the FeSAC which evolve SAC based on the concept of SAC. The SAC algorithm is a DRL method that optimizes random policies in an off-policy manner.
Its core feature is entropy regularization, where policy training trades off maximizing expected reward and entropy.
Increasing entropy makes the policy explore more, speeding up the subsequent learning process and preventing the policy from prematurely converging to a local optimum.
This makes it well-suited for exploring optimal strategies in several differentiated environments. Therefore, we choose this algorithm as our infrastructure.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The complete FeSAC algorithm we proposed is shown in Algorithm 1.
Firstly, the algorithm initializes the local network parameters of local networks (two local trend networks and one policy network).
Then initialize the global network (two global trend networks), and equalize the global trend networks and local trend networks’ parameters.
The agents first each initialize an empty replay memory and store a backup of the global trend networks.
And the agent will collect information about the local environment as the input of the policy network and output an action.
Then, the agent get the reward value and the next state from the local environment, calculate the cumulative discount function at each moment, and store the transition in the replay memory.
When the number of transitions in the replay memory reaches the number set in advance, the algorithm starts training.
It updates the local network parameters (two local trend networks and a policy network). Finally, the algorithm updates the temperature parameters.
After running a preset training iterations, the agents will upload their local trend network parameters to the federated center node.
After receiving the local trend network parameters of agents, the federated center node integrates these parameters and updates the global trend network parameters.
Afterward, the federated center node distributes the global trend network parameters to each agent, and agents update their backup with the latest global trend networks.
Through this integrated and distributed processing method, the local network in the agents can reflect the real-time situation of global environment.</p>

CartPole is a cart-pole game with a cart, and a pole erected.
The algorithm needs to control the cart to move left or right to keep the pole upright while satisfying the constraints.
Whenever an operation is performed without tilting the rod beyond the limit, the environment rewards the agent with a value of 1, otherwise 0.
Our goal is to verify the algorithm’s performance in several differentiated environments.
Therefore, the transfer probability of the environment is varied by changing the length of the pole to obtain multiple differentiated environments and setting up agents in each of the differentiated environments.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the FeSAC algorithm, we use the output of the policy network to control the agents.
And, an additional node is set as a federated center node for models aggregation and distribution.
As described in the previous section, agents in different environments share knowledge by sharing global trend networks.
In the actual algorithm implementation, considering the communication overhead between agents, each agent stores a backup copy of global trend networks locally to guide the local data training.
After a certain number of training sessions, i.e. soft update, the local trend networks are uploaded to the federal center node for aggregation, and the latest global trend networks are downloaded to update the local backup.
This approach can reduce the communication overhead incurred during training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The characteristic between the FeSAC algorithm and the traditional FRL algorithm is that the differentiation between different environments is considered in the learning process.
Therefore, we use the SAC algorithm trained by traditional federated learning as our baseline, i.e. FedAVG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the agents in each environment share the model including both value parameters and policy model parameters in the SAC algorithm, and the models are aggregated and distributed periodically using averaging model parameters.
In addition, we implement a centralized RL algorithm to verify the performance of a non-federated learning algorithm in this scenario. The centralized RL algorithm uses a SAC agent to collect information directly in each environment and then train.</p>

As can be seen, the FeSAC algorithm steadily increases and eventually converges as the training progresses.
In contrast, the reward of other algorithms fluctuates significantly during the training process and is lower than that of the FeSAC algorithm.

This indicates that the FeSAC algorithm can obtain policy models more suitable for agents in differentiated environments than the traditional FRL algorithm.
The global policy model obtained by direct aggregation of the traditional FRL algorithm is difficult to adapt to this differentiated environment.
Further, the FeSAC algorithm can avoid the additional communication overhead incurred by the centralized RL algorithm when transmitting environmental information.</p>

However, during the delivery of the packets, the link is broken, or the relay node exceeds the load and other situations that increase the delay of the network.
It is necessary to analyze the current network state combined with the historical state and then predict the future network state to make an appropriate offloading strategy.
Therefore, we abstract the traffic offloading decision problem as a Markov decision process (MDP).</p>

If the action is 0, the system will still transmit the packet to the next network node according to the original routing path.
In addition, each action value represents a neighbor node of the offloading node, and the system will offload the packet to a new routing path according to this action value.
The neighbor node can be UAV, or LEO and GEO.</p>

The local base station nodes are training nodes for federated learning to collect the network environment state in replay memory for training.
The neural network in each training node can be divided into Actor-network and Critic-network.
The Actor-network is responsible for outputting the action of traffic offloading based on the policy network.
The Critic-network is responsible for judging the action and the environment trends, which are used to optimize and improve the performance of the policy network.
Meanwhile, the edge base station node is used as a federated center node to receive local trend networks uploaded by the local base station nodes, aggregate the parameters and then distribute them to the local base station nodes to update their network parameters to the latest.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In this part, we describe the simulation environment and evaluate our FeSAC-based traffic offloading method.
The simulation environment simulates a dynamic and heterogeneous SAGIN environment.
The source node device and the destination node device are modeled as user equipment (UE).
The source node device generates data using a normally distributed data generation rate.
The relay node device transfers data packets based on the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) traffic routing protocol or the proposed traffic offloading method.
The relay nodes are modeled as BS, UAV, LEO, and GEO.
Except for BS are static, other devices have their mobile models.
The source node and destination node devices use a random-waypoint mobility model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, which can simply randomize the device’s location.

For the mobility model of UAV, we set UAV to fly in a certain direction at a fixed speed in a predefined period.
After a while, the UAV’s moving direction will shift arbitrarily and fly at the same moving speed.
We consider that LEO periodically covers the considered area as it is moving around the earth.
For GEO, due to its high coverage, we consider it to cover the target area all the time and have a stable connection (i.e. the air condition change is not considered).

It can be seen from the figure that if the offloading method is not adopted, with the increase of source nodes, the average packet delay increases obviously.
The difference between our proposed method and the DDQN method in the delay value is not significant at the beginning.
Still, as the number of source nodes increased to 380, our proposed method began to show its advantages.
And as the number of nodes continues to increase, this advantage becomes more significant.
We can see obvious performance differences when the number of source nodes increases to about 480.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The dynamic and heterogeneous environment brings differentiated regions and non-IID data, which leads to a local strategy trap for RL.
In this paper, we propose a novel concept of Differentiated Federated Reinforcement Learning for the networks with dynamic and heterogeneous environments by isolating the local policy model from the global integration and using the trend model to distinguish differences among regions.
Compared with the conventional FRL, the proposal focuses on adjusting differentiated regions’ biases and ensuring the local policy model’s independence.
The proposal shows its outperformance with experiments with both classical games and heterogeneous network environments.</p>
