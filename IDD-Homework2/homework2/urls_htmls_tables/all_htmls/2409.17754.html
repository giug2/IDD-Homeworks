<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a distributed machine learning approach that addresses privacy concerns by training AI models locally on devices. Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) extends the FL paradigm by eliminating the central server, thereby enhancing scalability and robustness through the avoidance of a single point of failure. However, DFL faces significant challenges in optimizing security, as most Byzantine-robust algorithms proposed in the literature are designed for centralized scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation algorithm to enhance the security of Decentralized Federated Learning environments, coined <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">WFAgg</span>. This proposal handles the adverse conditions and strength robustness of dynamic decentralized topologies at the same time by employing multiple filters to identify and mitigate Byzantine attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in maintaining model accuracy and convergence in the presence of various Byzantine attack scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art centralized Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes (such as <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Multi-Krum</span> or <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Clustering</span>). These algorithms are evaluated on an IID image classification problem in both centralized and decentralized scenarios.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The integration of Machine Learning (ML) into modern technology has significantly transformed various sectors, particularly with the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This growth has led to an exponential increase in the generation and distribution of big data across devices, highlighting both new opportunities and challenges for advanced data processing techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The classical approach to handling this amount of data has several disadvantages in terms of security, privacy, and scalability, as all this data (and the trained algorithm) is stored and processed in a large centralized datacenter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In response to these challenges, Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as an alternative paradigm that allows machine learning algorithms to work without the centralization of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. FL leverages the computational capabilities of end devices, enabling them to train their own ML models with their local data. A central server then merges all the locally trained models from the end devices to compute a global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. This method enhances privacy by design, as it does not expose all data at a single location, while utilizing the processing capabilities of the devices. However, traditional federated learning still relies on a central server to manage the learning algorithm process, which can be a target for privacy and security attacks by malicious attackers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, among other ongoing challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) extends FL principles by eliminating the central server, thereby mitigating the risks associated with a single point of failure and enhancing privacy by avoiding a centralized coordination of the learning process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This decentralized approach promotes greater resilience, allowing the learning process to continue even if some nodes fail or go offline, thus improving the robustness and fault tolerance of the overall network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, while the decentralization of these learning environments offers benefits such as improved scalability, it also introduces new challenges, including increased vulnerability to security threats. The absence of a central server complicates the implementation of uniform security-preserving algorithms and makes the system more susceptible to attacks such as Byzantine failures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Notably, Byzantine failures occur when a group of Byzantine clients attempts to disrupt the proper learning process, e.g., by altering their updates to degrade other local model’s performance (known as Byzantine attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>). Additionally, the heterogeneity among nodes, with varying computational capabilities or data quality, can lead to inconsistencies and reduce the effectiveness of the learned model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the potential of the DFL paradigm, research on securing such environments is still limited, with most existing works focusing on centralized FL approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Many of these approaches utilize Byzantine-robust aggregation algorithms designed to mitigate/filter malicious attacks from adversarial nodes in the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.

</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Originally introduced by Google in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the classical version of federated learning involves each client maintaining a local model trained with its own training dataset, while a central aggregator (or parameter server) maintains a global model that is updated through the local models of the clients. In depth, centralized FL proceeds as follows <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> (in a specific round): (i) the server sends the current global model parameters to all client devices, (ii) each client updates its local model by performing one or several steps of an optimization algorithm (in the literature, the most common is Stochastic Gradient Descent) using the current global model parameters and their local training datasets, then, (iii) devices send their updated local models back to the server where (iv) the server aggregates these local models from the clients using a specific aggregation rule to compute a new global model for the next round. The most recognized aggregation rule in FL field is Federated Average <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">FedAvg</span>. This process is carried out in multiple communication rounds, an iterative process that continues until the global model reaches the desired level of accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Of particular interest in this work is the novel paradigm of Decentralized Federated Learning which, despite not being the predominant approach in this field, introduces certain features that make it a promising alternative. In DFL, various nodes/clients collaborate and train their local models collectively without the necessity of a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, distributing the aggregation process among the nodes of the learning network. This eliminates the need to share a global model with all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One of the key advantages of DFL is promoting scalable and resilience environments, allowing nodes to join or disconnect from the learning network based on the power resources of the devices. Unlike centralized approaches, which can become bottlenecks or single points of failure, DFL distributes the workload over the entire network, improving fault tolerance and making the system more robust against attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Another significant advantage of DFL over centralized approaches is the reduction in communication resources and the decrease in high bandwidth usage due to the elimination of intermediate model/gradient transmissions between clients and the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This is particularly relevant in environments with a large number of interconnected devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the significant potential of DFL, research on this topic remains sparse, indicating it is an emerging field. This scenario must confront new challenges absent in centralized approaches due to the decentralized learning process and decision-making across numerous devices. For example, designing communication protocols that define how clients exchange their models in order to prevent excessive communication overheads. Gossip Learning is a notable decentralized communication protocol for asynchronous updates between nodes, leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) schemes to achieve scalability and potential privacy preservation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Although effective, gossip learning has a slower aggregation evolution due to its fully distributed nature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Hybrid protocols combining gossip and broadcast techniques offer greater adaptability to various decentralized scenarios, facilitating model sharing only with neighboring nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Other works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> propose blockchain-based FL environments that provide trustworthy schemes by guaranteeing the immutability of exchanged models through a peer-to-peer consensus mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, DFL approaches lead to high inconsistency among local models since there is no global model. Some proposals, such as increasing gossip steps in local communications, achieve better consensus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Another approach involves a consensus-based DFL algorithm inspired by discrete-time weighted average consensus frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Additionally, techniques like optimizing the consensus matrix to enhance the convergence rate and architectures focusing on continuous consensus over aggregated models are explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FL process is vulnerable to attacks on collaborative training, which can negatively impact model performance and the overall robustness of the system. Model performance can be compromised through specific targeted attacks (including backdoor attacks that disrupt the model’s ability to accurately classify a particular category) or through general untargeted attacks (such as Byzantine attacks, which focus on obstructing the collaborative training process by providing false updates) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. There are two main different ways of carrying out untargeted attacks: by poisoning the data with which the model is trained (data poisoning) or by manipulating the local model before sending it to the server (model poisoning). As previous research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> has shown that model poisoning attacks have a greater impact compared to data poisoning attacks, this work will concentrate on the former.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most well-known techniques to counter data/model poisoning attacks performed by malicious nodes, which can be considered Byzantine attacks, are Byzantine-robust techniques. To mitigate or eliminate these Byzantine faults that threaten the proper functioning of FL, various Byzantine-robust algorithms have
emerged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. These include redundancy-based and trust-based schemes that seek to mitigate Byzantine attacks either by assigning each client redundant updates or by assuming the presence of reliable nodes for filtering attacks, respectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.

It proposes processing the received gradients to generate relevant magnitude, sign, and similarity statistics, which are then used collaboratively by multiple filters to eliminate malicious gradients before the final aggregation. The key idea is that the sign distribution of sign-gradient can provide valuable information in detecting advanced model poisoning attacks.</p>

Unlike the previous proposal, this method uses an initial trust model, trained on a small maintained dataset, to evaluate and weight the contributions of clients in the global model aggregation process. Thus, client updates that align closely with the server model’s direction are deemed trustworthy, while others are adjusted or discarded based on their deviation.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are also other proposals that do not only focus on the geometric properties of models for mitigating Byzantine attacks. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposes a method to mitigate the impact of Byzantine clients in federated learning through a spatial-temporal analysis approach. Apart from leveraging clustering-based methods to detect and exclude incorrect updates based on their geometric properties in the parameter space, the temporal analysis provides a more effective defense mechanism, which is crucial in environments where attack strategies may evolve during the course of model training. In this case, time-varying behaviors are addressed through an adjustment of the learning rate parameter.</p>

Clients alert abnormal behaviors in real-time using a continuous monitoring scheme based on the evolution of the global model’s accuracy over the rounds.

The aim is to perform a distinct type of criteria in each filter using various well-known techniques in this field for mitigating or eliminating malicious models. This approach seeks to compensate for the inadequacies of some techniques in detecting specific attacks by leveraging other techniques. This fact is especially relevant in adversarial decentralized environments, as the number of received models can be low and the fraction of malicious nodes can be high (depending on the network topology).</p>

It seeks to identify if a node has conducted a Byzantine attack in a particular round or if the nature of such an attack is semi-random, causing sudden model changes between rounds. Therefore, this algorithm cannot be considered for a Byzantine-robust aggregation scheme because if a malicious node perpetrates a well-designed attack with little variability between rounds, will not be detected.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The comparison of a node’s current model with its models sent in previous rounds (which should be non consecutive) is done using geometric metrics, specifically, Euclidean distance and cosine similarity. When analyzing the temporal changes between rounds for a node, a time window of the last rounds is considered to extract the necessary metrics. Each node only needs to store the history of the distance metrics and only the last model sent by each neighboring node. Both the mean and the variability within this time window are studied to compare with the latest model update.</p>

From these metrics, both the mean and the standard deviation are extracted by applying an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), i.e., the most recent metrics in the time window are considered, which is useful since patterns change over time (non-stationary). Subsequently, new metrics are calculated with the model received in the current round, and it is observed if they fall within the thresholds calculated with the mean and standard deviation. If any of them do not meet the criteria, the model update is considered abrupt and malicious in that round.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of the upcoming tests, described in the following subsections, is to better understand the effectiveness of these Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes under multiple adversarial attacks. These attacks aim to degrade the model performance of the learning process, affecting both the local models accuracy and the global convergence of the learning process. Therefore, this evaluation consists of three different tests that will be analysed on the selected algorithms. First, examine and analyse the robustness of the algorithms to Byzantine attacks (Subsection <a href="#S6.SS1.SSS1" title="VI-A1 General analysis of the attack effectiveness ‣ VI-A Evaluation of state-of-the-art Byzantine-Robust Schemes ‣ VI Results and Discussion ‣ Byzantine-Robust Aggregation for Securing Decentralized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-A</span>1</span></a>).

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This proposal presents an algorithmic solution to strengthen security against malicious attacks in Decentralized Federated Learning environments. It integrates techniques based on Byzantine-robust algorithms, which mitigate security vulnerabilities in Federated Learning, particularly when central servers are removed to achieve true decentralization. The integration of various techniques, such as security filters based on distance, similarity, and temporal changes, enables the identification and mitigation of malicious contributions from Byzantine nodes and adapts to the adverse conditions posed by the variability of decentralized scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Experiments demonstrated that the proposed algorithm effectively maintains model accuracy and achieves satisfactory model convergence in the presence of all the considered Byzantine attacks, outperforming multiple centralized algorithm proposals evaluated in decentralized scenarios. The combination of multiple filters allowed for more precise detection of malicious contributions by weighting the results of these filters and considering different decisions for a potential Byzantine attack. Therefore, the integration of Byzantine-robust schemes in Decentralized Federated Learning scenarios establishes an efficient alternative to address the challenges faced by such environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, further studies are still needed in the field of Decentralized Federated Learning. Continuing with the proposed work, it is interesting to study in depth the optimization of communication networks to reduce overhead and latency, among other factors, to enhance overall learning process performance. In this regard, we are working on the implementation of technologies such as Software-Defined Networks (SDN) to not only improve network parameters as mentioned but also to propose scalable and dynamic DFL environments. This paradigm allows exploration of other alternatives, such as enhancing the security of the learning process from the perspective of communication between devices.</p>
