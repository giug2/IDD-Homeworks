<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning framework that enables devices to learn a global model from the feature-partition datasets without sharing local raw data.
However, as the number of the local intermediate outputs is proportional to the training samples, it is critical to develop communication-efficient techniques for wireless vertical FL to support high-dimensional model aggregation with full device participation.
In this paper, we propose a novel cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) based vertical FL system to enable fast and accurate model aggregation by leveraging over-the-air computation (AirComp) and alleviating communication straggler issue with cooperative model aggregation among geographically distributed edge servers.
However, the model aggregation error caused by AirComp and quantization errors caused by the limited fronthaul capacity degrade the learning performance for vertical FL.
To address these issues, we characterize the convergence behavior of the vertical FL algorithm considering both uplink and downlink transmissions.
To improve the learning performance, we establish a system optimization framework by joint transceiver and fronthaul quantization design, for which successive convex approximation and alternate convex search based system optimization algorithms are developed.
We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture and optimization framework for vertical FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), as an emerging distributed learning paradigm, has recently attracted lots of attention by enabling devices to collaboratively learn a global machine learning (ML) model without local data exchanging to protect data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Based on the partition of datasets, FL is typically categorized into horizontal FL and vertical FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, horizontal FL is adopted in the sample-partition scenario where different devices share the same feature space but have different samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Vertical Federated Learning over Cloud-RAN: Convergence Analysis and System Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>.
Vertical FL, on the other hand, enables devices to collaboratively learn a global model from the feature-partition datasets that share the same sample space but different feature spaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Vertical Federated Learning over Cloud-RAN: Convergence Analysis and System Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>.
Vertical FL has wide applications across e-commerce, smart healthcare, and Internet of Things (IoT).
For example, in IoT networks, data collected by different types of sensors (e.g., video cameras, GPS, and inertial measurement units) need to be smartly fused for planning and decision-making <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
As each participant owns partial model in vertical FL, the messages exchanged between participants are based on the intermediate outputs of the sub-model and its local data, rather than local updates as in horizontal FL.
The number of intermediate outputs is proportional to the number of training samples.
This leads to high-dimensional data transmission with a large volume of training samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
In addition, since vertical FL needs to aggregate all local intermediate outputs to obtain the final prediction, it requires all devices to participate <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#0000FF;">in</span> the training process in vertical FL.
Therefore, the high-dimensional data transmission with full device participation in vertical FL brings a unique challenge for communication-efficient system design.
Existing works on device selections in horizontal FL cannot address this issue in wireless vertical FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To design communication-efficient wireless vertical FL, it is critical to develop novel wireless techniques to transmit intermediate outputs over shared wireless medium with limited radio resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Conventional orthogonal multiple access schemes aim to decode individual information, which however ignores the communication task for data transmission.
Instead, over-the-air computation (AirComp) serves as a promising approach to enable efficient aggregation for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
By exploiting waveform superposition of multiple access channel, AirComp can directly aggregate the local updates via concurrent uncoded transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
As a result, AirComp can reduce the required radio resources and the access latency compared with orthogonal multiple access schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
To further improve the communication and learning efficiency of wireless FL with AirComp, the intrinsic properties of the local updates are exploited, e.g., gradient sparsity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, temporal correlation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, spatial correlation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and gradient statistics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
However, due to the heterogeneity of channel conditions across different devices, AirComp based FL inevitably suffers from the communication stragglers, i.e., the devices with the weak channel conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the communication straggler devices enforcing the magnitude alignment for AirComp may result in high model aggregation error, which degrades the learning performance.
Although it can be alleviated by excluding the stragglers from the model aggregation process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, partial device participation reduces the size of the FL training datasets, which deteriorates the performance for FL models.
Besides, these works mainly focus on horizontal FL with partial device selection and are inapplicable in the vertical FL scenario.
The reason is that vertical FL requires all the devices to participate the training process since each device owns one sub-model of the global model.
It is thus critical to design a novel AirComp-based transmission scheme for wireless vertical FL with full device participation.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To enable all devices including the straggler devices to participate in the training process, one approach is to improve the wireless channel quality through advanced communication technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and reconfigurable intelligent surface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
However, these wireless techniques may become inapplicable in the IoT scenarios with massive geographically distributed devices.
An alternative approach is to effectively extend the wireless transmission coverage by deploying multiple edge servers, thereby cooperatively assisting data exchanges between the devices and the edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
This can shorten the communication distances between the devices and the edge servers, which enhances the transmission reliability and reduces the latency for the straggler devices.
A growing body of recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of deploying multiple edge servers for FL, including semi-decentralized FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and hierarchical FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
To mitigate inter-cluster interference, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed to allocate orthogonal radio resource blocks for each device for model aggregation in FL.
However, this orthogonal transmission scheme is inefficient due to the limited spectrum resources.
In addition, many studies have considered distributed edge computing systems based on Cloud-RAN architecture with various communication metrics, such as energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, for resource management.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose to leverage cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) to enable cooperative model aggregation across densely deployed multiple edge servers over large geographic areas.
This is achieved by moving baseband processing from remote radio heads (RRHs) (i.e., edge servers) to a baseband unit (BBU) pool (i.e., central server), where digital fronthaul links connect the central server and the edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, the learning performance and communication efficiency can be significantly improved through cooperative model aggregation and centralized signal processing for large-scale wireless vertical FL system.
Besides, since the baseband signal processing and model aggregation are moved to the central server in the BBU pool, edge servers only need to support basic signal transmission functionality, which further reduces their energy consumption and deployment cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, we propose a fast and reliable transmission scheme to support vertical FL with geographically distributed devices over wireless networks.
Different from the existing works on vertical FL over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, we shall implement AirComp-based vertical FL over Cloud-RAN to support heterogeneous devices.
However, the fronthaul links between the edge servers and the central server have limited capacity, which causes additional quantization error.
Furthermore, the quantization error along with AirComp model aggregation error severely degrade the learning performance of vertical FL.
The main purpose of this paper is to reveal the impact of limited fronthaul capacity and AirComp aggregation error on the learning performance and then optimize the Cloud-RAN enabled vertical FL system by jointly considering the learning performance and communication efficiency.

Since the central server only receives the aggregation of local prediction results, i.e., neither local features nor local models are uploaded to the central server, the privacy of local data can be guaranteed.
Nevertheless, the number of local prediction results at each device is proportional to the number of training samples, which leads to high-dimensional data transmission.
In addition, all devices are required to participate the training process in vertical FL since each device owns a sub-model <math id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{w}_{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒘</mi><mi id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2">𝒘</ci><ci id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1c">\bm{w}_{k}</annotation></semantics></math>.

In this case, the edge servers first receive the AirComp results of the local prediction results transmitted by the devices, and then forward the aggregated results to the central server.
By exploiting the signal superposition property of a wireless multiple access channel, the central server directly processes the aggregated version of analog modulated local information simultaneously transmitted by the devices, which significantly reduces transmission latency.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed framework performs centralized signal processing via AirComp by exploiting the cooperation among edge servers, thereby achieving reliable and low-latency model aggregation.
Note that we assume all the RRHs are active during FL training, since vertical FL require all the devices to participate in FL training.
A key challenge of the Cloud-RAN system is that the quantization errors caused by the limited fronthaul capacity and the aggregation errors caused by AirComp will severely degrade the learning performance of vertical FL.
In this paper, our goal is to understand the impact of limited fronthaul capacity and AirComp aggregation error on the learning performance for vertical FL, followed by designing efficient Cloud-RAN system optimization framework to improve the vertical FL performance.
To this end, we analyze the convergence of Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="In II-A Vertical Federated Learning ‣ II System Model ‣ Vertical Federated Learning over Cloud-RAN: Convergence Analysis and System Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> under the AirComp based Cloud-RAN, and characterize the convergence with respect to the transmission parameters (e.g., transmit/receive beamforming vectors and quantization covariance matrices) in the next section.</p>

As discussed later in this section, the communication noises significantly degrade the convergence performance of the vertical FL algorithm in terms of the optimality gap over the AirComp-based Cloud-RAN.
It is noteworthy that a similar type of aggregation noise was also considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.
However, they addressed the aggregation noise from the algorithmic perspective, while this paper aims to reduce the noise impact through the design of the communication system.
In addition, the effect of aggregation noise on vertical FL algorithms is different from that on horizontal FL algorithms.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section presents the system optimization for vertical FL over the AirComp-based Cloud-RAN.
We first formulate the resource allocation problem by minimizing the optimality gap under the system constraints including the limited fronthaul capacity and the transmit power constraints.
Then, we decompose the resulting optimization problem into two sub-problems, i.e., uplink and downlink optimization problems which are solved by the successive convex approximation (SCA) and alternate convex search (ACS) approaches.</p>

It is observed that the proposed algorithms under two considered downlink power constraints are both able to linearly converge.
This implies that the proposed algorithm can effectively compensate for the distortion of channels and noises, thereby speeding up the convergence and reducing optimality gap.
Furthermore, the case with higher downlink power constraint achieves better performance gains (smaller optimality gap), since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in this case is higher.</p>

It is observed that the proposed joint optimization for wireless and fronthaul resource allocation achieves higher test accuracy and less training loss over Baselines 1-3, and approaches the performance upper bound when the fronthaul capacity is greater than or equal to 180 Mbps.

We can therefore conclude that the performance gain of joint optimization is mainly obtained from the quantization optimization at edge servers.
On the other hand, as the fronthaul capacity increases, it is observed that Baseline 2 outperforms Baseline 3.
This is due to the impact of quantization error on the performance of vertical FL becomes negligible, and thus the scheme with optimized beamforming can achieve better performance.</p>

Specifically, by deploying more edge servers in the network, each device can be served by the nearest edge server with strong channel conditions, which significantly mitigates communication straggler issues.
A larger number of RRHs results in better channel condition due to dense deployment of RRHs.
However, the capacity allocated on each server will be small, resulting in a large quantization error on the learning performance, vice versa.
This leads to a trade-off between the channel conditions and quantization error in multi-antenna Cloud-RAN, which allows an optimization of the number of RRHs for maximizing the learning performance.
As the total capacity increases, we should allocate more edge servers to exploit better channels for devices to improve performance.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel framework based on AirComp and Cloud-RAN to support communication-efficient vertical FL over wireless networks.
To reveal the impact of limited fronthaul capacity and AirComp aggregation error on the learning performance, we characterized the convergence behavior in terms of resource allocation.
Based on the derived optimization gap for the wireless vertical FL algorithm, we further established a system optimization framework to minimize optimization gap for the wireless vertical FL algorithm under various system constraints.
To solve this problem, we proposed to decompose the original system optimization problem into two sub-problems, i.e., uplink and downlink optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved by successive convex approximation and alternate convex search approaches.
Extensive numerical results have shown that the proposed system optimization schemes can achieve high learning performance and the effectiveness of the proposed Cloud-RAN network architecture for vertical FL was also verified.</p>
