<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that can coordinate heterogeneous edge devices to perform model training without sharing private data. While prior works have focused on analyzing FL convergence with respect to hyperparameters like batch size and aggregation frequency, the joint effects of adjusting these parameters on model performance, training time, and resource consumption have been overlooked, especially when facing dynamic data streams and network characteristics. This paper introduces novel analytical models and optimization algorithms that leverage the interplay between batch size and aggregation frequency to navigate the trade-offs among convergence, cost, and completion time for dynamic FL training. We establish a new convergence bound for training error considering heterogeneous datasets across devices and derive closed-form solutions for co-optimized batch size and aggregation frequency that are consistent across all devices. Additionally, we design an efficient algorithm for assigning different batch configurations across devices, improving model accuracy and addressing the heterogeneity of both data and system characteristics. Further, we propose an adaptive control algorithm that dynamically estimates network states, efficiently samples appropriate data batches, and effectively adjusts batch sizes and aggregation frequency on the fly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our offline optimal solutions and online adaptive algorithm.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> has gained much attention as it enables distributed model training by multiple collaborative devices without exposing their raw data. In the meanwhile, with the increasing amount of data generated from different geographical locations and the proliferation of edge computing technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, deploying FL at edge devices has become a promising computation paradigm to facilitate data-driven applications (e.g., smart surveillance and personalized healthcare) while preserving data privacy. Unlike traditional distributed machine learning (DML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, FL allows each training device (a.k.a. worker) to perform multiple local updates before uploading their model parameters to the central server in each aggregation round, and it does not require partitioning a central pool of data across distributed workers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its advantages, FL still faces two major challenges: 1) skewed distributions and unbalanced sizes of training data at different devices (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">statistical challenge</span>), and 2) heterogeneous and limited edge resources (<span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">system challenge</span>). The former is also referred to as non-independent-and-identical (non-i.i.d.) data, which has been analyzed for representative FL algorithms, especially FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Studies to address the system challenge have mainly focused on improving the learning efficiency by mitigating the impact of slow “straggler” devices on the wall-clock time of training and communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
In addition, the cost due to either the energy consumed over a long training period <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> or operational charge paid to incentivize participating clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> can be prohibitive for FL at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Thus, taking both time and cost into consideration when configuring training tasks on heterogeneous devices is of vital importance for FL algorithms.
To address these challenges simultaneously, we call for a full-fledged FL algorithm that can capture the three-way trade-off between convergence, training time, and cost expenditure.
Recent works have analyzed the model convergence when varying different controls, e.g., balancing the number of local updates and aggregation rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, or adjusting workers’ mini-batch sizes under a time budget <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, but these metrics are generally considered separately.
In contrast, we propose to jointly optimize the aggregation frequency and mini-batch sizes, as they are the hyperparameters that determine the amount of data processed in each aggregation round and thus most affect these performance metrics.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Further, we have the following intuitions about these performance metrics. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>-Left, increasing either the mini-batch size (interchangeably used with batch size in this paper) or the number of local updates can lead to more training samples processed and thus improve the local model accuracy. However, doing so can also increase the consumed cost and training time.
Moreover, a larger number of local updates (lower aggregation frequency) may result in a larger gap between the local and global models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, hindering convergence, though this effect may depend on the batch size at each device.
Therefore, we ask: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">what is the best way to improve the FL model training when we can control both of these variables?</span> To the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first attempt to co-optimize mini-batch size and global aggregation frequency under dynamic edge networks, considering performance metrics of model accuracy, training time, and resource cost.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This work also reveals that strategically choosing <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">different mini-batch sizes among clients</span> is crucial to improve model accuracy, time, and cost expenditure. A motivating example might be performing an FL task for object detection on heterogeneous edge devices using their locally captured pictures. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>-Right, the generally accepted “no-straggler” principle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which assigns the batch sizes of different FL devices for ensuring a uniform time per aggregation round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, may not be optimal for this scenario.
Specifically, the laptop with high training speed but relatively few data samples will have a large mini-batch while other data-rich devices such as the smartphone can only have a small mini-batch due to the relatively slow training speed. This could severely impede the convergence rate, as a small mini-batch size could introduce a high variance to the stochastic gradients (see Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Training Error Bound Analysis ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>).
On the other hand, if we neglect the clients’ heterogeneous computing capacities by simply setting a uniform batch size as what FL practitioners usually do <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the straggler effects can be severe. Batch sizes, however, cannot help to limit battery usage and communication latency during model synchronization.
Therefore, jointly choosing the aggregation frequency in the meanwhile is also important for balancing the energy cost, training time, and model accuracy. To achieve this, we make the following <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">technical contributions</span>:</p>

We extend the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> FL framework by allowing different clients to use different mini-batch sizes.
We capture FL clients’ heterogeneity in the sizes and distributions of their datasets, based on which we then derive a novel convergence upper bound for the global model training, with respect to the aggregation frequency and batch sizes. Prior theoretical works usually assume a <span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">full-batch</span> training setting to achieve bounded convergence rates, but practical FL deployments generally adopt the mini-batch approach. Our error bound can help bridge this inconsistency by quantifying the impacts of batch sizes considering the clients’ heterogeneous data characteristics.</p>

We propose an optimization model to capture the complex trade-offs among accuracy, completion (computation plus communication) time, and cost.
Driven by our derived convergence bound, we provide closed-form solutions that co-optimize the batch size and aggregation frequency uniformly across clients. These results capture the interplay between these two control variables and can be easily adopted by FL developers.
We also propose an efficient algorithm to optimize <span id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">heterogeneous</span> batch sizes for different clients, which can further increase the model accuracy.</p>

We design an adaptive control algorithm to dynamically choose the number of local updates and heterogeneous batch sizes among different clients, accommodating the online estimates of model convergence and system statistics across distributed training devices. Our algorithm can augment practical FL training strategies for both the cases of using static local datasets and dynamic data streams, with or without relying on limited data storage in a fluctuating edge network. Extensive experiments under different testbed settings demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms in terms of the accuracy, cost, and training time.</p>

This work is orthogonal to the former (i.e., it can be combined with gradient compression), and falls in the latter regime, since we also aim to choose the best hyperparameters (i.e., batch-size and aggregation frequency). To optimize the learning speed, most studies choose hyperparameters to mitigate the effect of ”straggler” devices,
such as device sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and staleness control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Alternatively, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> also consider optimizing batch sizes to improve FL efficiency by equalizing the epoch time for each device to mitigate the straggler effect. However, their works either lack theoretical analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> or neglect data heterogeneity and resource constraints across clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, which are important characteristics in edge systems. Several studies propose new strategies to handle streaming data for model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. However, they do not focus on balancing the tradeoff among cost, accuracy, and training time.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Controlling FL under resource constraints</span> has risen as the main challenge for edge-enabled FL training.
An increasing number of studies have been proposed to improve FL accuracy under resource budgets, accounting for either completion time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> or operational cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Luo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> propose a cost-effective FL design to choose the number of participants and local updates for total training cost minimization, respectively. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> derive a tractable convergence bound with an arbitrary number of local updates and design an algorithm for dynamically adjusting the aggregation frequency. Our work additionally analyzes the joint effect of mini-batch size on convergence, time, and cost metrics. A few recent works also consider choosing the mini-batch size. E.g, Ma et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> propose a synchronous FL algorithm to adjust the batch size, and Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> jointly optimize the batch size, gradient compression ratio, and spectrum allocation for wireless FL. Our work provides a new convergence bound with respect to <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">heterogeneous</span> clients’ batch sizes and provides <span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">both closed-form optimal solutions and online adaptive controls</span> for jointly selecting the aggregation frequency and batch sizes.</p>

clients divide their local data into mini-batches, perform multiple local updates, and upload their local models to the PS, which then broadcasts the updated global model to the clients by aggregating the local models.
Prior works either assume using the whole dataset for each round (<span id="S3.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">full-batch training</span>) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> or simplify the effects of batch size on the convergence and training time in their analysis (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>).

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to data centers, mobile edge devices usually have limited computing resources such as CPUs and GPUs. Their limited battery lives also restrict the energy available for FL. Moreover, edge devices in FL training often establish the connection with the PS through the Wide Area Network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, which could also incur high bandwidth costs in each communication round.
It is therefore necessary to consider both computation and communication costs.

Further, for the emerging applications of FL training under real-time data, e.g., video analytics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, we identify that limited on-device storage and online data streams (<em id="S6.p1.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data dynamics</em>) need to be incorporated, especially for those performed on edge devices. For instance, the storage of smartphones can range from 128GB to 1TB, but the bit rates of data streams collected for running today’s FL-supported video analytics tasks, can be as large as 3 gigabytes per minutes (1080p, 30fps, w/o compression). If the online training lasts longer, the edge storage may be used up<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> before the training ends. Moreover, it is not appropriate to use a static aggregation frequency and batch sizes solved from the offline optimization problem (see Section <a href="#S5" title="5 An Offline Algorithm and Theories ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>), given that the parameters related to the data and network dynamics are time-varying.</p>

Such strategies will, however, inevitably lead to a biased global model. Hence, we adopt reservoir sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> in our online algorithm to ensure that every data can have the same possibility of being stored in the buffer and thus selected into the batch during the whole training process.</p>

Thus we first examine the impact of different data sampling strategies in different online settings. DYNAMITE(Res), DYNAMITE(Ran), and DYNAMITE(FIFO) are strategies of using DYNAMITE combined with sampling methods of Reservoir Sampling, Random Sampling, and FIFO, respectively. Fig.<a href="#S7.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 7.2.3 Adaptive control for co-optimized aggregation frequency and heterogeneous batch sizes (static datasets) ‣ 7.2 Experimental results and interpretation ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> shows that DYNAMITE(Res) which uses <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Reservoir Sampling</span> has significant advantages over other sampling strategies, especially in the <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Continuous stream</span> settings, i.e., Smooth-Continuous, Burst-Continuous, Random-Continuous. It can be explained as follows. Both <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Random Sampling</span> and <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FIFO sampling</span> methods prefer to select data arrived later and discard data arrived earlier, which can easily lead to a biased model training and thus a biased global FL model. Fig. <a href="#S7.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 7.2.3 Adaptive control for co-optimized aggregation frequency and heterogeneous batch sizes (static datasets) ‣ 7.2 Experimental results and interpretation ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(b)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S7.F7.sf4" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 7.2.3 Adaptive control for co-optimized aggregation frequency and heterogeneous batch sizes (static datasets) ‣ 7.2 Experimental results and interpretation ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(d)</span></a> together show that biased sampling can not only lead to poor model performance but also catastrophic forgetting when training on a continuous data stream. On the other hand, if the data stream is i.i.d. (Fig <a href="#S7.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 7.2.3 Adaptive control for co-optimized aggregation frequency and heterogeneous batch sizes (static datasets) ‣ 7.2 Experimental results and interpretation ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a>), the performance difference among various sampling methods can be negligible, since the classes and the number of data samples that clients receive is always nearly the same, and thus how to select data is not of vital importance in this case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We also notice that unlike other arrival patterns in continuous stream setting, DYNAMITE(Ran) and DYNAMITE(Res) can have similar performance in burst arrival setting (Fig. <a href="#S7.F7.sf3" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 7.2.3 Adaptive control for co-optimized aggregation frequency and heterogeneous batch sizes (static datasets) ‣ 7.2 Experimental results and interpretation ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(c)</span></a>). We here present a reasonable interpretation to explain this result. First, <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Random Sampling</span> and <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Reservoir Sampling</span> are two similar methods in general. The major difference is that reservoir sampling guarantees that every data sample can have the same probability to be stored in the buffer by uniformly sampling both an up-coming and a previously stored data point. <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Random Sampling</span>, on the other hand, only discards data stored in the buffer uniformly at random, and it replaces a discarded data point with the latest-coming data. It then can inevitably result in biases, since the distribution of the selected data batch does not represent the full data stream. Consequently, model performance after every buffer update step is impeded, as presented in Fig. <a href="#S7.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 7.2.3 Adaptive control for co-optimized aggregation frequency and heterogeneous batch sizes (static datasets) ‣ 7.2 Experimental results and interpretation ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(b)</span></a> and <a href="#S7.F7.sf4" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 7.2.3 Adaptive control for co-optimized aggregation frequency and heterogeneous batch sizes (static datasets) ‣ 7.2 Experimental results and interpretation ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(d)</span></a>. However, clients receive data samples in a short period of time in <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Burst arrival</span> setting. So the clients have less frequent buffer updates compared to <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Smooth arrival</span> or <span id="S7.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Random arrival</span>, which eventually close the gap of these two similar sampling methods (Fig. <a href="#S7.F7.sf3" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 7.2.3 Adaptive control for co-optimized aggregation frequency and heterogeneous batch sizes (static datasets) ‣ 7.2 Experimental results and interpretation ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(c)</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work proposes a novel framework to quantify and optimize the interplay of the number of local update steps and heterogeneous batch sizes across clients for federated learning performed at distributed edge devices. Technically, we derive a novel convergence bound with respect to those control variables, and analyze the performance metrics of cost and training time as well.
We then provide closed-form solutions for our joint optimization in special cases and propose an efficient exact algorithm for the general case. Our strategies consider both heterogeneous system characteristics and non-i.i.d. data, which can improve the common strategies that FL practitioners adopt. Moreover, we adapt our offline strategy to dynamically adjust the decisions on the fly, with superiority of several performances demonstrated in extensive experiments.</p>

These experimental results are consistent with our theoretical expectations and intuitive understanding. The insight is that clients can store more diverse training samples with a larger buffer, leading to a more stable and better FL training process. Additionally, compared to smooth arrival and random arrival, DYNAMITE is more sensitive to the buffer size under burst arrival scenarios, where most data samples are received in a short period of time, which poses greater challenges to clients with limited buffers. We also observe that DYNAMITE often requires a larger buffer to reach the same test accuracy in burst arrival settings (Burst arrival: 25k, Smooth and Random arrival: 10k). Further, the reservoir sampling method adopted by DYNAMITE algorithm consistently yields superior model performance across all buffer size settings. In contrast, the other sampling methods (Random sampling and FIFO sampling) have demonstrated varying degrees of catastrophic forgetting, resulting in model degradation issues due to their biased selection principles.</p>

The new experiments are performed under three different data arrival patterns (explained in Section 7.1.3) to fully simulate the data dynamics in online training. In the case of smooth arrival and random arrival patterns of streaming datasets, the number of local updates demonstrates a general decrease while the average batch size displays a consistent increase during the training process. Compared to the smooth arrival pattern, both of these two variables exhibit more pronounced fluctuations under the random arrival pattern due to the higher degree of uncertainty in random arrival settings. On the other hand, we have observed that, under burst arrival settings, the number of local updates exhibits an abrupt increase in the 1000-th round, precisely aligning with the time when the participating clients receive an enormous amount of data and therefore have a significant increase in the model training loss. These results match our theoretical analysis in Theorem <a href="#Thmthm1" title="Theorem 1 (Error bound with heterogeneous batch sizes 𝑠_𝑖). ‣ 4 Training Error Bound Analysis ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Remark <a href="#Thmrem1" title="Remark 1. ‣ 5.1 Case 1: Co-optimizing uniform s and τ ‣ 5 An Offline Algorithm and Theories ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, as well as the experimental results in static datasets shown in Figure <a href="#S7.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 7.1.3 Streaming Data configurations and arrival patterns ‣ 7.1 Experiment setup ‣ 7 Experimental Validation ‣ DYNAMITE: Dynamic Interplay of Mini-Batch Size and Aggregation Frequency for Federated Learning with Static and Streaming Dataset" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>.</p>
