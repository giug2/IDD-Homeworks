<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Deep learning</em>-based linkage of records across different databases is becoming increasingly useful in data integration and mining applications to discover new
insights from multiple sources of data.
However,
due to privacy and confidentiality concerns,
organisations often are not willing or allowed to share their sensitive data with any external parties,
thus making it challenging to build/train deep
learning models for record linkage across different organizations’ databases.
To overcome this limitation,
we propose the first deep learning-based multi-party
privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) protocol that can be used to link sensitive databases held by multiple different organisations.
In our approach,
each database owner first trains a local deep learning model,
which is then uploaded to a secure environment and securely aggregated to create a global model.
The global model is then used by a linkage unit to distinguish unlabelled record pairs as matches and
non-matches.
We utilise differential privacy to achieve provable privacy protection against re-identification attacks.
We evaluate the linkage quality and scalability
of our approach using several large real-world databases, showing that it can achieve high linkage quality while providing sufficient privacy protection against existing
attacks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Organisations in many business domains increasingly produce large databases with
millions of records, which might contain detailed and sensitive information about
people, such as customers, patients, taxpayers, or travellers. Often such databases
need to be shared and integrated to facilitate advanced analytics and processing.
However, due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, organisations are not allowed
or not willing to share their databases in plain text
for data linkage purposes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this light, <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">privacy-preserving record linkage</em> (PPRL) aims to develop
techniques that facilitate the linking of databases without the need of any
sensitive data to be shared among the involved organisations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
This process is often challenging because no unique entity identifiers,
such as social security numbers, are available in the databases to be linked.
Therefore, quasi-identifying attributes such as names and addresses,
are used to identify records that are similar and likely belong to the same entity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Such quasi-identifiers are however often not allowed to be
shared between organisations due to privacy and confidentiality concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A popular approach to link sensitive data in a privacy-preserving way is to encode quasi-identifying values, such as using Bloom filters, that allows
<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">fuzzy matching by calculating approximate similarities on the encoded values
in order to identify matches and non-matches</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Traditional PPRL applications commonly use a naïve threshold-based classifier
to classify encoded record pairs as matches if their corresponding approximate
similarity scores are above an user defined similarity threshold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Recent record linkage literature has shown that supervised classifiers,
such as deep learning techniques, can yield significantly high accuracy of
linkage, especially in big data applications, where the data is prone to
errors and variations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">However,
deep learning brings in several challenges for PPRL.</span>
First, supervised techniques, such as deep learning, require large amounts of
training data to train a linkage model, which is challenging due to the lack
of ground truth links. Further, generating training data with manual labelling
is costly and time consuming, leading to limited available training data.
Second, training a global linkage model across multiple databases
(held by different parties) requires exchanging the training data of individual
parties among each other or with a trusted linkage unit, which raises additional
security and privacy concerns.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the use of a distributed learning setting, such as federated learning,
in the PPRL context might not overcome the problem of exchanging sensitive data
entirely due to the privacy risk involved in the linkage process. This is because the
database owners need to reveal their unlabelled records to calculate
record pair similarities with other database owners’ unlabelled records.
Thus, privacy techniques need to be applied to individual records instead of
the local models as performed in federated learning. To the best of our knowledge,
deep learning has not been studied for PPRL so far, while its advantages have
been effectively utilized in non-PPRL applications.

(3) we theoretically prove the privacy guarantees provided by our approach,
and (4) empirically evaluate the linkage quality, efficiency, and privacy guarantees using nine data sets from different domains,
which shows that our approach can defend against a recently proposed PPRL attack method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>,

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">A long line of research has been conducted in privacy preserving record linkage
(PPRL) over the past three decades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
As surveyed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the existing PPRL techniques
can be categorised into four generations.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The first generation of PPRL techniques focused on linking records that have the
exact same quasi-identifiers (QIDs) across data sets, supporting only
exact matching. The second generation considered fuzzy matching of QIDs to
account for errors and variations in the QIDs across different data sets.
The third generation of techniques considered scalability of the PPRL process
to linking large databases as an important aspect in addition to the support
for fuzzy matching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</span></p>

more advanced methods tailored for the different Big Data challenges; velocity,
variety, veracity, and volume. A key challenge of Big Data is to improve
the linkage performance in the presence of data errors by using machine
learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</span></p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Over the last decade several deep learning based techniques
have been proposed to link entities in databases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Kooli et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> studied the use of deep Neural Networks (DNN) for linking
records where record pairs are classified into matches or non-matches based on
word embeddings using a DNN model.
DeepER is another deep learning-based linkage approach, that achieves high
linkage quality by using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short term
memory (LSTM) hidden units <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The aim is to convert each record
to a distributed representation (i.e., a feature vector), which can effectively
capture similarities between records. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> uses deep learning for active
and transfer learning to reduce the cost of manual labelling required for improving
the accuracy of linking records. This approach allows to learn a
transferable model from a high-resource setting to a low-resource one, and to
further adapt to the target data set, active learning is incorporated that
carefully selects a few informative examples to fine-tune the transferred model.</span></p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">However, these existing deep learning-based linkage techniques are not applicable
to PPRL. To the best of our knowledge, no work has so far considered addressing
the privacy constraints in deep learning-based linkage. Supervised learning
classifiers, such as deep learning techniques, that are trained on sensitive
data sets (as is the case with most linkage applications), can be vulnerable to
inference attacks, especially membership or attribute inference attacks when
utilised in PPRL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</span></p>

requires the output of a data analysis mechanism to be approximately
the same if any single record is replaced with a new one.

compute the result of the analysis must contain some form of randomness

and <em id="S4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">classification</em>. Similar to a federated learning setting,
we allow different DOs to train a classification model collaboratively
in the training phase.
This classification model is then sent to a linkage unit (LU) to classify the unlabelled record pairs in the differentially
private BF databases sent to
it by the DOs into matches and non-matches. We next describe each phase in more details.

Different neural network architectures have
been proposed to consider different types of embedding structures in
entity resolution literature,
the most popular of which uses a recurrent structure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
We use unidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNN) with long
short term memory (LSTM) hidden units <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>,
thus called as LSTM-RNNs. In our approach, all DOs agree on the
parameter settings to be used on the local models. We provide the details
of the hyper-parameter selection of individual local models in
Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Experiments ‣ Privacy-preserving Deep Learning based Record Linkage" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.

training phase: 1) adding differential privacy noise to the encoded
Bloom filters (BFs) and training the local models on the noise
added BFs to make the trained local models robust against
inference attacks when shared, or 2) adding differential privacy noise
to the trained model weights and exchanging only the noise added model
weights.</span></p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In the context of PPRL,
the linkage of unlabelled records requires exchanging or sharing the (encoded)
records between the DOs or with a third party (linkage unit),
and thus the (encoded) records need to be privatised in any case.
Hence, in our approach the method (1) is more appropriate,
because for linking or classifying record pairs using the trained
model, the similarities between records from different DOs need to
be computed and used by the LU.</span></p>

record pairs need to be conducted on the same feature space, i.e.
training the model on non-perturbed BFs and classifying the
perturbed BFs of unlabelled record pairs, would not learn correctly
and perform accurate linkage.
Thus, we apply differential privacy
noise to the BFs and train the deep learning model,
which is then used by the LU to classify the (differentially private)
BFs of the unlabelled record pairs.</span></p>

DBLP-ACM and DBLP-Scholar consist of links between academic
publications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. We used the attributes authors names,
publication name, venue, and year as the linkage attributes. For these two
data sets, we use two variations Clean and Dirty for experiments,
where Clean data sets contain records without any data quality issues,
while Dirty data sets embody various data quality problems,
such as missing values, misspellings, and variations of values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

three PPRL techniques. (1) We used a BF based PPRL technique (named as <span id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">BF</span>),
which uses a similarity threshold to classify record pairs encoded into BFs as matches and non-matches.
(2) For the second baseline approach (named as <span id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DP-BF</span>),
we adapted the first baseline approach by adding differentially private noise
into BFs before the linkage. (3) We applied the same deep learning technique
in the classification step of the first baseline approach <span id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">BF</span> to make the third
baseline, named as <span id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DL-BF</span>. In this approach, we did not include any
differentially private noise into BF encodings.</p>

As expected,
our approach consumes more runtime compared to other approaches because of the addition of
differentially private noise in BFs and the independent training of the local models by each DO.
DP-BF and DL-BF need a similar runtime due to the independent noise addition and local model training by each DO, respectively,
as classification of unlabelled record pairs by the LU requires a small amount of additional runtime for
feature generation for the record pairs generated by the blocking technique.
Thus,
the use of an efficient blocking technique can reduce the additional overhead of runtime required by the LU to a minimum.</p>

approaches on different data sets. As can be seen, DL-BF achieves
the best precision and recall values among all approaches.
Our approach, DP-DL-BF achieves a similar linkage quality as DL-BF,
but, showing a slightly lower recall.
This is because of the noise addition in BFs,
which leads to true match record pairs being classified as non-matches in the classification phase. However,
both BF and DP-BF resulted in lower linkage quality (20% – 40% in terms
of F- and F*-measures) compared to the deep learning based approaches,
indicating that deep learning models can classify encoded record pairs
with a higher accuracy than the naïve threshold based classification technique.</p>

privacy noise in BFs can render a threshold based classifier less effective as
precision and recall drop by at most 33% and 43%, respectively.
This indicates that the use of differential privacy in practical linkage projects
with threshold based classifiers requires careful fine-tuning of BF encoding and
threshold parameters to achieve an acceptable level of linkage quality.</p>

(as in BF and DL-BF), the attack identified frequent attribute values correctly
for different attribute combinations.
For the DBLP-ACM-C data set the attack correctly identified the 4 most frequent
author names correctly. For NCVR,
the attack correctly identified the 10 most frequent first names
correctly while for the European Census data set the attack
re-identified the top 20 first names correctly.
Further, as our privacy results show, the attack failed to correctly
identify the attribute values encoded in BFs when bits are flipped

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The re-identification results suggest that the approaches DP-BF and DP-DL-BF have low re-identification risk compared to BF and DL-BF approaches because
of differential privacy guarantees provided by DP-BF and DP-DL-BF approaches.
By flipping bits in BFs,
the attack was not able to recognise the q-grams map to a certain bit position,
thus avoiding the 1-to-1 or 1-to-many re-identifications.
This is because many of the
BFs contain different bit patterns leading each BF not being assigned
to a plain text value.
Therefore, DL-DP-BF provides adequate privacy against frequency based privacy attacks,
while achieving a high linkage quality as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ 6.1.2 Performance evaluation metrics ‣ 6.1 Experimental setup ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Privacy-preserving Deep Learning based Record Linkage" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Further, we noted that as we increase the number of attributes the attack did not
re-identify plain text values as not enough frequency information is available to
identify q-grams that are encoded in the BFs. Hence,
conducting such cryptanalysis attacks upon BFs that are encoded with q-grams from
different attributes was unlikely to be successful.</p>

As can be seen from this
figure, the classification phase consumes more runtime compared to the training
phase due to the additional runtime required by the LSH blocking technique.
Thus, we would like to highlight that the efficiency of the classification
technique can be improved by using a more efficient blocking technique.</p>

We have seen the runtime required for the training phase increases linearly with an increasing number of DOs while runtime for classification by the LU increases exponentially.
This is because in the training phase each DO performs training of their local models independently while the LU performs an exponential number of BF pair comparisons.

numbers of DOs involved in the linkage process. As can be seen from the table,
the linkage quality decreases (2% – 15% in precision and 15% – 30% in recall)
when more databases are to be linked. This is due to the randomisation in DP noise
perturbation in BFs as different bits can be flipped in matching BFs in different
databases.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning has been used in record linkage due to its superior performance
in linking records. However, existing deep learning techniques cannot be used
in privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) due to data availability issues.
For the first time, we proposed a deep learning-based privacy-preserving
record linkage (PPRL) protocol that can be used to link sensitive databases
held by different organisations with high linkage accuracy. The organisations
collaboratively train a deep learning model on deferentially private (DP)
Bloom filters (BFs) which is then used by a linkage unit to classify unlabelled
BF pairs as matches and non-matches. Our experimental evaluation shows that the
proposed approach can achieve high linkage quality while providing strong
privacy protection against privacy attacks. As future work, we aim to explore
how local DP can be used with an untrustworthy aggregator in the training
phase of our approach. We also plan to investigate how transfer
learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> can be used to address the problem of limited
training data in PPRL.</p>
