<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) rests on the notion of training a global model in a decentralized manner. Under this setting, mobile devices perform computations on their local data before uploading the required updates to improve the global model. However, when the participating clients implement an uncoordinated computation strategy, the difficulty is to handle the communication efficiency (i.e., the number of communications per iteration) while exchanging the model parameters during aggregation. Therefore, a key challenge in FL is how users participate to build a high-quality global model with communication efficiency. We tackle this issue by formulating a utility maximization problem, and propose a novel crowdsourcing framework to leverage FL that considers the communication efficiency during parameters exchange. First, we show an incentive-based interaction between the crowdsourcing platform and the participating client’s independent strategies for training a global learning model, where each side maximizes its own benefit. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze such scenario and find the game’s equilibria. Second, we formalize an admission control scheme for participating clients to ensure a level of local accuracy. Simulated results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed solution with up to 22<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo mathcolor="#000000" id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> gain in the offered reward.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have admittedly witnessed a tremendous growth in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques and its applications in mobile devices. On one hand, according to International Data Corporation, the shipments of smartphones reached 3 billions in 2018 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which implies a large crowd of mobile users generating personalized data via interaction with mobile applications, or with the use of in-built sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones and GPS) exploited efficiently by mobile crowdsensing paradigm (e.g., for indoor localization, traffic monitoring, navigation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>). On the other hand, mobile devices are getting empowered extensively with specialized hardware architectures and computing engines such as the CPU, GPU and DSP (e.g., energy efficient Qualcomm Hexagon Vector eXtensions on Snapdragon 835 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>) for solving diverse machine learning problems. Gartner predicts that 80 percent of smartphones will have on-device AI capabilities by 2022. With dedicated chipsets, it will empower smartphone makers to achieve market gain by offering more secured facial recognition system, the ability to understand user behaviors and offer predictive future <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This means <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">on-device intelligence</span> will be ubiquitous!</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the backdrop to these exciting possibilities with on-device intelligence, a White House report on principle of data minimization had been published in 2012 to advocate the privacy of consumer data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The direct application of this is the ML technique that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, called <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">Federated Learning</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This technique unleashes a new collaborative ecosystem in ML to build a shared learning model while keeping the training data locally on user devices, which complies with the data minimization principle and protects user data privacy. Unlike the conventional approaches of collecting all the training data in one place to train a learning model, the mobile users (participating clients) perform computation for the updates on their local training data with the current global model parameters, which are then aggregated and broadcasted back by the centralized coordinating server. This is an iterative process that undergoes until an accuracy level of the learning model is reached. By this way, FL decouples the training process to learn a global model by eliminating the mobility of local training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In another report, research organizations estimate that over 90% of the data will be stored and processed locally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> (e.g., at the network edge), which provides an immense exposure to extract the benefits of FL. Also, because of the huge market potential of the untapped private data, FL is a promising tool to exploit more personalized service oriented applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Local computations at the devices and their communication with the centralized coordinating server are interleaved in a complex manner to build a global learning model. Therefore, a communication-efficient FL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> requires solving several challenges. Furthermore, because of limited data per device to train a high-quality learning model, the difficulty is to incentivize a large number of mobile users to ensure cooperation. This important aspect in FL has been overlooked so far, where the question is <span id="S1.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">how can we motivate a number of participating clients, collectively providing a large number of data samples to enable FL without sharing their private data?</span> Note that, both participating clients and the server can benefit from training a global model. However, to fully reap the benefits of high-quality updates, the multi-access edge computing (MEC) server has to incentivize clients for participation. In particular, under heterogeneous scenarios, such as an adaptive and cognitive-communication network, client’s participation in FL can spur collaboration and provide benefits for operators to accelerate and deliver network-wide services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Similarly, clients in general are not concerned with the reliability and scalability issues of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Therefore, to incentivize users to participate in the collaborative training, we require a market place. For this purpose, we present a value-based compensation mechanism to the participating clients, such as a bounty (e.g., data discount package), as per their level of participation in the crowdsourcing framework. This is reflected in terms of local accuracy level, i.e., <span id="S1.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">quality of solution to the local subproblem</span>, in which the framework will protect the model from imperfect updates by restricting the clients trying to compromise the model (for instance, with skewed data because of its i.i.d nature or data poisoning) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Moreover, we cast the global loss minimization problem as a primal-dual optimization problem, instead of adopting traditional gradient descent learning algorithm in the federated learning setting (e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>). This enables in (a) proper assessment of the quality of the local solution to improve personalization and fairness amongst the participating clients while training a global model, (b) effective decoupling of the local solvers, thereby balancing communication and computation in the distributed setting.</p>

Second, we address the challenge of maintaining communication efficiency while exchanging the model parameters with a number of participating clients during aggregation. Specifically, communication efficiency in this scenario accounts for communications per iteration with an arbitrary algorithm to maintain an acceptable accuracy level for the global model.</p>

We design a crowdsourcing framework, in which FL participating clients iteratively solve the local learning subproblems for an accuracy level subject to an offered incentive. We then establish a communication-efficient cost model for the participating clients. We then formulate an incentive mechanism to induce the necessary interaction between the MEC server and the participating clients for the FL in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Incentive Mechanism for Client’s Participation in the Decentralized Learning Framework ‣ A Crowdsourcing Framework for On-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

With the offered incentive, the participating clients independently choose their strategies to solve the local subproblem for a certain accuracy level in order to minimize their participation costs. Correspondingly, the MEC server builds a high quality centralized model characterized by its utility function, with the data distributed over the participating clients by offering the reward.
We exploit this tightly coupled motives of the participating clients and the MEC server as a two-stage Stackelberg game. The equivalent optimization problem is characterized as a mixed-boolean programming which requires an exponential complexity effort for finding the solution. We analyze the game’s equilibria and propose a linear complexity algorithm to obtain the optimal solution.</p>

In this detailed work, the authors focus on deducing the optimal global aggregation frequency in a distributed learning setting to minimize the loss function of the global problem. Their problem considers resource constrained edge computing system. However, the setting differs with our proposed model where we have introduced the notion of participation, and proposed a game theoretic interaction between the workers (participating clients) and the master (MEC server) to attain a cost effective FL framework. Earlier to this work, McMahan, H. Brendan, et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a practical variant of FL where the global aggregation was synchronous with a fixed frequency. The authors confirmed the effectiveness of this approach using various datasets. Furthermore, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> extended the theoretical training convergence analysis results of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to general classes of distributed learning approaches with communication and computation cost. For the deep learning architecture where the objectives are non-convex, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed an algorithm namely FedProx, a special case of FedAvg where a surrogate of the global objective function was used to efficiently ensure the empirical performance bound in FL setting. In this work, the authors demonstrated the improvement in performance as in their theoretical assumptions, both in terms of robustness and convergence through a set of experiments.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent works adapt and extend the core concepts in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to develop a communication-efficient FL algorithm, where each participating clients in the federated learning setting independently computes their
local updates on the current model and communicates with a central server to aggregate the parameters for the computation
of a global model. The framework uses Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to reduce communication costs. In
these regard, to characterize the communication and computation trade-off during model updates, distributed machine
learning based on gradient descent is widely used. In the mentioned work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a variant of distributed stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) was used to attain parallelism and improved computation. Similarly, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the authors discussed
about a family of new randomized methods combining SGD, with primal and dual variants such as Stochastic Variance
Reduced Gradient (SVRG), Federated Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (FSVRG) and Stochastic Dual Coordinate
Ascent (SDCA). Further, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> the authors explained about the redundancy in gradient exchanges in distributed SGD,
and proposed a Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) algorithm to enhance communication efficiency in FL setting. The
performance of parallel SGD and mini-batch parallel SGD had been discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> for fast convergence and
effective communication rounds. However, authors in their recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> argue for the sufficient improvement in
generalization performance with the variant of local SGD rather than the large mini-batch sizes, even in a non-convex setting.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed the Distributed Approximate Newton (DANE) algorithm for precisely solving a general
subproblem available locally before averaging their solutions. In the recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the authors designed a
robust method which applies the proposed periodic-averaging SGD (PASGD) technique to prevent communication delay
in the distributed SGD setting. The idea in this work was to adapt the communication period such that it minimizes the
optimization error at each wall-clock time. To this end, interestingly, in some of the latest works such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors have well-studied and demonstrated the privacy risk scenario under collaborated learning mechanism such as FL.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to the above research that has overlooked the participatory method to build a high-quality central ML model and its criticality, and primarily focused on the convergence of learning time with variants of learning algorithms, our work addresses the challenge in designing a communication and computational cost effective FL framework by exploring a crowdsourcing structure. In this regard, few recent studies have discussed about the participation to build a global ML model with FL as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Basically, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> the authors proposed a novel distributed approach based on FL to learn the network-wide queue dynamics in vehicular networks for achieving ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) via a joint power and resource allocation problem. The vehicles participate in FL to provide information related to sample events (i.e., queue lengths) to parameterize the distribution of extremes. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the authors provided new design principles to characterize edge-learning and highlighted important research opportunities and applications with the new philosophy for wireless communication called <span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">learning-driven communication</span>. The authors also presented some of the significant case studies and demonstrated the effectiveness of design principles in this regards. Further, recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> studied the block-chained FL architecture proposing the data reward and mining reward mechanism for FL. However, these works largely provide a latency analysis for the related applications. Our paper focuses on the Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism design to <span id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">reveal the iteration strategy</span> of the participating clients by solving the local subproblems for building a high-quality centralized learning model. Interestingly, incentive mechanism has been studied for years in mobile crowdsourcing/crowdsensing systems, especially with auction mechanisms (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>), contract and tournament models (e.g, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>) and Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanisms such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. However, the design goals were specific towards fair and truthful data trading of distributed sensing tasks. In this regard, the novelty of our model is that we untangle and analyze the complex interaction scenario between the participating clients and the aggregating edge server in the crowdsourcing framework to obtain a cost-effective global learning model without sharing local datasets. Moreover, the proposed incentive mechanism models such <span id="S2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">interactions</span> to enable <span id="S2.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">communication-efficient</span> FL, which is able to achieve a target accuracy, in consideration with the performance metrics. Further, we adopt the dual formulation of the learning problem to better decompose the global problem into distributed subproblems for federated computation across the participating clients.</p>

The crowdsourcer (platform) can interact with mobile clients via an application interface, and aims at leveraging FL to build a global ML model. As an example, consider a case where the crowdsourcer (referred to as MEC server hereafter, to avoid any confusion) wants to build a ML model. Instead of just relying on available local data to train the global model at the MEC server, the global model is constructed utilizing the local training data available across several distributed mobile clients. Here, the global model parameter is first shared by the MEC server to train the local models in each participating client. The local model’s parameters minimizing local loss functions are then sent back as feedback, and are aggregated to update the global model parameter. The process continues iteratively, until convergence.</p>

Note that MEC adapts admission control strategy (discussed in Section VII) to improve the number of participation for maximizing its utility. In fact, MEC has to increase the reward rate to maintain a minimum number of participation (at least two) to realize the distributed optimization setting in FL. In addition to this, the framework may suffer from slower convergence due to fewer participation.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have designed and analyzed a novel crowdsourcing framework to enable FL. An incentive mechanism has been established to enable the participation of several devices in FL. In particular, we have adopted a two-stage Stackelberg game model to jointly study the utility maximization of the participating clients and MEC server interacting via an application platform for building a high-quality learning model. We have incorporated the challenge of maintaining communication efficiency for exchanging the model parameters among participating clients during aggregation. Further, we have derived the best response solution and proved the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium. We have examined characteristics of participating clients for different parametric configurations. Additionally, we have conducted numerical simulations and presented several case studies to evaluate the framework efficacy. Through a probabilistic model, we have designed and presented numerical results on an admission control strategy for the number of client’s participation to attain the corresponding local consensus accuracy. For future work, we will focus on mobile crowdsourcing framework to enable the self-organizing FL that considers task offloading strategies for the resource constraint devices. We will consider the scenario where the central coordinating MEC server is replaced by one of the participating clients and devices can offload their training task to the edge computing infrastructure. Another direction is to study the impact of discriminatory pricing scheme for participation. Such works can narrate towards numerous incentive mechanism design, such as offered tokens in blockchain network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. We also plan to further investigate on participating client’s behavior, in terms of incentive and communication efficiency, to incorporate cooperative data trading scenario for the proposed framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.</p>
