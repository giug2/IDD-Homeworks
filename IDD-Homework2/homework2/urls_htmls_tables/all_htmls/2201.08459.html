<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Standard Federated Learning (FL) techniques are limited to clients with identical network architectures. This restricts potential use-cases like cross-platform training or inter-organizational collaboration when both data privacy and architectural proprietary are required. We propose a new FL framework that accommodates heterogeneous client architecture by adopting a graph hypernetwork for parameter sharing. A property of the graph hyper network is that it can adapt to various computational graphs, thereby allowing meaningful parameter sharing across models. Unlike existing solutions, our framework does not limit the clients to share the same architecture type, makes no use of external data and does not require clients to disclose their model architecture. Compared with distillation-based and non-graph hypernetwork baselines, our method performs notably better on standard benchmarks. We additionally show encouraging generalization performance to unseen architectures.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Konečný et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a strong model that benefits from their individual data, without having to share that data. In particular, aggregating the parameters of locally trained models alleviates the need to share raw data, thereby preserving privacy to some extent and reducing the volume of data transferred. FL allows safe and efficient learning from edge nodes like smartphones and self-driving cars. Another important use case is to improve performance among medical facilities while maintaining patient privacy, for example in disease identification.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most current FL approaches have a key limitation: all clients must share the same network architecture. As a result, they cannot be applied to many important cases that require learning with heterogeneous architectures. For example, depending on the computing power or OS version, different platforms may run different networks. For some organizations, changing models might hinder legacy expertise or pose regulatory challenges. Additionally, some organizations may wish to benefit from each other’s access to data without sharing their proprietary architectures. In all these cases, one is interested in <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning with heterogeneous architectures</span> (HAFL).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The following example illustrates why current FL approaches do not support clients with different architectures. Consider Federated Averaging (FedAvg), perhaps the most widely used FL technique, where model parameters of different clients are averaged on a shared server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Unless all clients share the same structure of parameters and layers, it is not well defined how to average their weights. The problem of aggregating weights across different architecture is not specific to FedAvg, but exists with other FL approaches.
This limitation raises the fundamental research question: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Can federated learning handle heterogeneous architectures? And can it be achieved with clients keeping their architectures undisclosed?</span></p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>An overview of our approach. We tackle a federated learning setup with clients that have different architectures by using a shared Graph Hypernetwork (GHN) that can adapt to any network architecture. At each communication round, a local copy of the GHN is trained by each client using their own data and network architecture (illustrated as graphs within each client; nodes represent layers and edges represent computational flow), before returning to the server for aggregation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The first work to consider FL with non-identical architectures is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Diao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Focusing on platforms with different computation capabilities, their setup assumes all clients share the same architecture type (e.g. ResNet18) and differ only in the number of channels per layer such that smaller capacity model parameters are subsets of the larger ones. This allows averaging of corresponding parameter subsets.
Another approach for HAFL is knowledge distillation. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> suggested distilling knowledge from ensembles of client models on a server using unlabeled or synthetic datasets. Although this solution could be beneficial in certain setups, it has two major limitations: (1) Client architectures must be disclosed and (2) External data must be provided. We could instead design a distillation-based approach to HAFL that does not require clients to share their architectures. First, train a global model between clients using standard FL. Then, distill knowledge from that shared model to train each client’s model on local data. Even though this solution addresses the two limitations discussed above, training a large global model might be difficult for clients with limited computing power. Moreover, only using locally available data for distillation may overfit and hinder the benefits of FL. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this approach bypasses, but does not address, the fundamental question: How can we learn to use knowledge about architectures when transferring information about model parameters between architectures?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a general approach to HAFL based on a hypernetwork (HN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ha et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> that acts as the knowledge aggregator. The hypernetwork takes as input a description of a client architecture and emits weights to populate that architecture. Unlike FedAvg, which aggregates weights in a predefined way, the hypernetwork implicitly learns an aggregation operator from data and can therefore be significantly more powerful.
For providing an architecture descriptor to the HN, we propose to represent client architectures as graphs, where nodes can represent both parametric layers (such as convolutional layers) and non-parametric layers (such as a summation operation) and directional edges represent network connectivity such as skip connections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To allow the hypernetwork to process any graph, regardless of its size or topology, we propose to use a <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">graph hypernetwork</span> (GHN)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. We therefore name our approach <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HAFL-GHN</span>. The GHN operates on a graph representation of the architecture and predicts layer parameters at each node that represents a parametric layer. During training, at each communication round, clients train local copies of the GHN weights using their own architectures and data (Fig. 1). Then, these weights are sent by the clients to the server where they are aggregated. Since different architectures have different layer compositions, representing layers as nodes allows meaningful knowledge aggregation across architectures. This forms an improved hypernetwork model that uses knowledge gleaned from different network types and datasets, to populate them with improved parameters. Critically, client architectures are not communicated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">HAFL-GHN relies on the ability of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) to generalize across different client architectures. We discuss this matter in light of recent results in theory of GNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yehudai et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and demonstrate experimentally that our approach generalizes to unseen architectures in certain cases – allowing clients to modify their architectures after federation has occurred, without the need for client-wide FL retraining.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Our experimental study on three image datasets shows that HAFL-GHN outperforms a distillation-based baseline, and a non-GNN based HN architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shamsian et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, by a large margin. This margin increases as the local dataset size decreases. We further show that HAFL-GHN provides a large benefit in generalization to unseen architectures, improving the accuracy of converged models and drastically shortening the time needed for convergence. Such generalization could allow new clients, with new architectures, to benefit from models trained on different data and different architectures, lowering the bar for deploying new, personalized, architectures.</p>

To solve this problem, <span id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized FL</span> (pFL) methods were proposed that adapt global models to specific clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kulkarni et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. FL with heterogeneous client architectures is, however, still underexplored. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Diao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> considered a setup where clients share the same computational graph and differ only in the number of channels per layer. By enforcing an inclusion structure, models of different capacity can aggregate corresponding parameter subsets. Most related to the current work is the recent work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shamsian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> that also used hypernetworks. Their method considers a simple case of clients with varying architectures, where three pre-defined simple architectures are “hard" encoded into the structure of the hypernetwork. <span id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In contrast, our framework allows clients to use a variety of layers and computational graphs, and facilitates better weight sharing as the same layers are used in different architectures. In the experimental section <a href="#S5" title="5 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Architectures using Graph HyperNetworks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> we show that our approach outperforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shamsian et al.

When the network weights are outputs of another network, proper initialization of the hypernetwork parameters must be carried out so as to output the proper main network initialization.

In contrast to the training stage, where the generated weights are used as-is, at the inference stage, they can be used as an initialization and then locally refined by using the client’s local dataset. The amount of improvement depends on the amount of local data. Furthermore, since this data has already been used for training the shared GHN model, minor improvements should be expected before overfitting might occur. We found that a single refinement epoch of just the linear prediction head worked well in practice.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate HAFL-GHN performance in two tasks. For natural image classification, we use two standard benchmarks in FL: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Another task that emphasizes the importance of enabling HAFL between medical facilities involves disease classification in chest x-ray scans. CNNs are widely adopted for image classification tasks, and architectures mostly differ in depth, layer types and graph connectivity (e.g. residual connection). We thus ran each experiment with four different network architectures, named Arch 0-3. Arch 0 is a standard ResNet18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015a</a>)</cite>, Arch 1 has 10 layers and no skip connections, Arch 2 has 12 layers and skip connections are used only in the <span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">first</span> 8 layers, and Arch 3 has 12 (different) layers with skip connection between the <span id="S5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">last</span> 8 layers.

In all experiments, we split the data (either uniformly or following a Dirichlet distributions, as indicated in the setup) between 4, 8, and 16 clients while maintaining an even distribution of the different architectures among clients (for instance, in the 8 clients case, we use 2 clients for each architecture).</p>

This can be attributed to weight sharing only occurring at the shared MLP responsible for the encoding the architecture, so the separate predictions heads do not benefit from federation. A reduced version of our method without the graph structure is also examined. This no-graph variant, which can be seen as a set network without information about the connectivity between the model layers, already performs very well.

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed in the introduction, a main motivation for HAFL is to allow cross-organizational collaborations. This is especially important when multiple entities have access to valuable data that cannot be shared, but use different neural architectures for processing it. Such is the case for medical clinics and hospitals. To showcase the application of our method to such a real-world problem, we tested it using medical data of X-ray images. The Chest X-ray <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with fourteen disease image labels (images can have multiple labels), extracted from medical reports using natural language processing. Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.3 Results on Chest X-ray ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Architectures using Graph HyperNetworks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> reports the average AUC score across 14 binary classification tasks for our method as well as the baselines. Our method achieves consistently superior performance.</p>

We want HAFL-GHN to enjoy a similar generalization, namely, that the GHN could generalize to clients whose architecture has not been observed during training.
Since neural architectures often share local structures, as with the various variants ResNets, when a new architecture is composed of local structures that have previously been seen, it may be feasible to generalize to a new composition of these known components (compositional generalization).

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A clear benefit of such generalization is that given a new architecture, our GHN can immediately populate it to give a better initialization. To test this we ran a “leave one out” experiment using CIFAR-10 dataset, where we let 3 clients with 3 different architectures train in an HAFL fashion. We then introduce a 4th architecture and refine it using only local data. We compare against training that architecture from scratch on that same data. The results shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.4 Generalization to unseen architectures ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Architectures using Graph HyperNetworks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and Table <a href="#A8.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ Appendix H Generalization – additional results ‣ Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Architectures using Graph HyperNetworks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> in the supplementary are very encouraging. When refining on local data, the unseen architecture performance ramps up very quickly and reaches similar performance to that achieved by the architectures that participated in the HAFL-GHN process. In contrast, the training-from scratch alternative takes a much longer to converge and reaches a consistently lower final performance.
<span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">We further stress tested the generalization capabilities, by introducing a much smaller CNN with only 4 layers. A practical scenario of this sort is training a model on an edge device together with stronger models on the server.

As these layers are repeated within the computational graphs of the different models, more sharing can be done, leading to a more efficient use of the federation.
Importantly, while same layers could be directly averaged, it is important that their location within the graph is encoded. This is done via message passing in our GNN. To verify its importance, we implemented a variant of our method that does not use a GNN and instead directly averages MLPs corresponding to the same layer types.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a new setup for federated learning called HAFL, and a first solution to this problem based on a graph hypernetwork. Our experiments yielded positive results: by modeling neural networks as graphs with layers as nodes, we have shown that GNNs can utilize recurring structures and facilitate efficient federation during learning and even generalization to new architectures.There are, however, a few limitations to our solution. First, it is limited to architectures built from predefined building blocks. In theory, this set could be arbitrarily large, but architectures that use disjoint sets of nodes may lose efficiency when sharing knowledge. Future work might benefit from combining the inclusion structure proposed on  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Diao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> to group layers that only differ in the number of channels. Second, as indicated by the upper-bound performance, our solution still is not yet comparable with a same-architecture FL performance. Finally, a more robust aggregation technique would alleviate the undesirable degradation of performance when local data is limited. Our hope is that this research will lead to further study of this important setup.</p>

<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Since our main architectures all use residual connections and same activation type, the graph connectivity suffices to express the architecture. However, in general, different non-parametric layers might be desired. For that, we implemented three versions of ResNet in which several different residual layers were replaced by concatenation, resulting in a hybrid addition-concatenation.
To that end, we included two new non-parametric types of nodes in our layer type set: “add” and “concat”. Participating in message passing, these nodes produce latent embedding, depending on where they reside in the graph. No additional parameters are required for them. We trained these 3 architectures together with the vanilla ResNet with four and eight clients with the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. On CIFAR10, the average results by architecture type are: 88.96, 89, 89, 89.2 for 4 clients and 88.6, 88.1, 88.3, 86.8 for 8 clients. On CIFAR100, the results are: 56, 56.2, 56.5, 48.200 for 4 clients and 50.6, 50.4, 47.7, 46.0 for 8 clients. The results are on par with those shown in Table 1. In particular, the performance obtained by the vanilla ResNet architecture on CIFAR10/100 with 4 and 8 clients respectively is: 88.96, 88.6, 56 and 50.6, whereas its performance under the HAFL-distillation baseline is 90, 85.7, 51.1, 44.2. In this example, HAFL-GHN shows success in training with two commonly used non-parametric layers.</span></p>

<p id="A7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">When the training data is unevenly distributed, performance can either be measured in a similar distributed test set or a balanced test set. In the former case, a client would like high performance on local, biased samples. Suppose a hospital specializes in a specific disease and hopes to improve model performance related to that disease through FL. We refer to that a “unbalanced” metric. Alternatively, a client might be interested in balancing its model bias, in which case the performance on the full (“balanced”) test set is of interest. We compare our HAFL-GHN against a local training. We also include the usual upper bound performance of standard FL with all clients using the same architecture.

Specifically, it can be seen that local training achieves high performance only on test sets of similar distribution, but severely sacrifices performance on sets of balanced distributions. The same architecture FL also shows a trade-off. Despite being the most performant on the balanced test set, it sacrifices accuracy on local distributions. HAFL-GHN’s capability to improve on local training in both tasks can be attributed to the inherent personalization of the network. That is, beyond its ability to adapt to new architectures, HAFL-GHN can also learn a personalized weight prediction according to the client distributions. This result aligns well with the observation of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shamsian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
