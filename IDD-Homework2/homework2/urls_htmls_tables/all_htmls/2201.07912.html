<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a useful tool in distributed machine learning that utilizes users’ local datasets in a privacy-preserving manner. When deploying FL in a constrained wireless environment; however, training models in a time-efficient manner can be a challenging task due to intermittent connectivity of devices, heterogeneous connection quality, and non-i.i.d. data. In this paper, we provide a novel convergence analysis of non-convex loss functions using FL on both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. datasets with arbitrary device selection probabilities for each round. Then, using the derived convergence bound, we use stochastic optimization to develop a new client selection and power allocation algorithm that minimizes a function of the convergence bound and the average communication time under a transmit power constraint. We find an analytical solution to the minimization problem. One key feature of the algorithm is that knowledge of the channel statistics is not required and only the instantaneous channel state information needs to be known. Using the FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we show through simulations that the communication time can be significantly decreased using our algorithm, compared to uniformly random participation.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a valuable machine learning (ML) tool that enables distributed training of neural network models without centralized data by utilizing computation at several distributed learners who use their own local datasets.
Model training is accomplished through a collaborative procedure in which the participating learners are sent the current model and then they each separately perform updates via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using their own locally collected datasets.
After a set number of local iterations, the participants send their updated model weights to an aggregator who updates the global model, typically through simple averaging of each participant’s update, as in <em id="S1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
The process then repeats by sending out the updated global model to all learners participating in the next round and continues until a satisfactory model is obtained.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the major advantages of the FL training process is that user privacy is preserved since the users’ data never leaves their device.
This allows the end user to take part in training and ultimately obtain better ML models without fear of revealing their private data.
The orchestration of FL over large-scale wireless networks, though, has proved to be a challenging task since the amount of communication required to converge to an acceptable model creates a large bottleneck in the process. This is particularly evident in dynamic mobile edge computing (MEC) environments where poor channel quality and intermittent connectivity can completely derail training.
For example, if a device loses connection to the server and does not participate in training for an extended period of time, the global model will begin to shift away from their locally optimal model which will negatively affect convergence until they rejoin.
If many devices are absent for extended periods of time, the global model will converge very slowly, or possibly not at all depending on the degree of heterogeneity of the data.
Additionally, if a device is available but has a very bad connection, resources will be wasted if they participate in every round.
Thus, device selection becomes a very important aspect in the management of FL in practice.
</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the original FL algorithm, <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, clients are selected uniformly at random in each round.
Although this strategy has been shown to converge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, in practice, devices are not always available for selection due to factors such as energy and time constraints.
Additionally, since this selection policy is agnostic to channel conditions and other factors, it will lead to the consumption of more network resources than necessary.
Thus, a more intelligent approach to device selection is needed to optimize network resource consumption.
However, before designing such an approach, the effect of arbitrary device selection on FL convergence must be understood to ensure convergence to a good model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we derive a novel convergence bound for non-convex loss functions with arbitrary device selection probabilities for each FL round.
Our new upper bound shows that as long as all devices have a non-zero probability of participating in each round, then FL will converge in expectation to a stationary point of the loss function.
We then use the knowledge of how the selection probabilities affect this newly found convergence bound to formulate a stochastic optimization problem that determines the optimal selection probabilities and transmit powers.
The objective function of the problem minimizes a weighted sum of the convergence bound and the time spent for communicating model parameters with a constraint on the peak and time average transmit power.
Communicating the model parameters over many rounds is the major bottleneck of FL.
Therefore, minimizing the communication time is very beneficial in speeding up convergence and minimizing the burden on the network.
The form of the convergence bound and our novel problem formulation allow us to utilize the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework to compute an analytical and distributed solution to the minimization problem with analytical expressions.
A key advantage of our new device selection algorithm is that it is able to make decisions according to current channel conditions without knowledge of the underlying channel statistics.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since its introduction in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, FL has garnered a lot of attention in both industry and academia with a major focus on providing privacy guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, characterizing convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and enhancing communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> through strategies such as model compression via sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
One of the biggest challenges with implementing FL at scale is the heterogeneity that is present in both the system and the data.
An alternative way to address communication efficiency and combat system heterogeneity is through device scheduling, or client selection. Doing this naively, however, can lead to suboptimal models due to the skew introduced by the heterogeneous, or non-i.i.d., data at the devices which is why we design our selection process based on its effect on convergence.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the first works specifically targeting the problem is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> where the FL training process is modeled in a MEC network with a wide variety of devices.
The scheduling procedure presented was designed to speed up convergence by having as many devices as possible to participate in each round within a desired time window.
The presented strategy, however, does not consider its effect on convergence and results in much poorer performance for non-i.i.d. datasets as indicated in their results. Some other empirical studies with similar approaches include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, but also do not consider or derive convergence bounds for their selection strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some later work began to include analysis of the convergence of FL with device selection.
Among these is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, but only the convergence of simple linear regression loss is considered. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the authors analyze the convergence of strongly convex loss functions, but unfortunately their bound introduces a non-vanishing term and thus their strategy is not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the loss function. Both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> consider convergence, but only for strongly convex loss functions. Convergence results for non-convex loss functions with partial device participation have also been presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, but they only consider the case where devices are chosen uniformly at random with or without replacement and do not allow for arbitrary selection probabilities.
Finally, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> considers arbitrary probabilities for each device, but these probabilities are held constant throughout training and are not reflected in the parameter aggregation weights. Additionally, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, all devices must participate in the first round for convergence.
We improve upon these results by considering non-convex loss functions and derive a bound with no non-vanishing term under the condition that all devices have an arbitrary non-zero probability of participating in each round.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> develop frameworks that jointly optimize convergence and communication over wireless networks.
Similarly to our approach, they derive a convergence bound and then minimize it by finding the optimal parameter values.
For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the FL loss is minimized while meeting the delay and energy consumption requirements via power allocation, user selection, and resource block allocation.
Both papers, however, make the unrealistic assumption that the channel remains constant throughout the training process which we do not assume here.</p>

<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, stochastic optimization is used to determine an optimal scheduling and resource block policy that simultaneously minimizes the FL loss function and CSI uncertainties.
The loss function considered, though, is simple linear regression and does not readily apply to neural network models.
Stochastic optimization is also considered for FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, but not to design an optimal device selection policy that guarantees convergence of non-convex loss functions like we do here.</p>

Additionally, analyzing <em id="S3.p2.3.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</em> with arbitrary probabilities allows us to observe the effect that a scheduling policy that controls these probabilities has on convergence in order to design a better policy.
The modified algorithm can be found in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In III Problem Formulation ‣ Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Stochastic Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

Note that this algorithm is logically equivalent to one where only the participating clients receive the model updates and compute the gradient updates.
Notice that each device’s aggregation weight is inversely proportional to their probability of being selected.
This ensures that the gradient updates remain unbiased.
Intuitively, it ensures that devices with low participation can still have sufficient influence on the global model when they do participate.</p>

More specifically, we minimize a weighted sum of the last term in (<a href="#S4.Ex4" title="Corollary 1. ‣ IV Convergence Analysis ‣ Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Stochastic Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) and the average time spent communicating over the channel while satisfying transmission power constraints. Since communicating the model parameters over many rounds is the major bottleneck of FL, minimizing the communication time is very beneficial in speeding up convergence time and minimizing the burden on the network.
Our formulation allows for the application of the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework which leads to an analytical solution that does not require knowledge of the exact dynamics or statistics of the channel; only the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is needed.
The solution can also be computed in a distributed fashion in which each device can determine its own selection probability, and since selection is done independently, each device can notify the aggregator when it should be selected.</p>

This allows us to apply standard theorems from the Lyapunov stochastic optimization framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to reformulate (<a href="#S5.E7" title="In V Communication-Efficient Scheduling Policy ‣ Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Stochastic Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>) into a form that we solve analytically.
While the framework specializes in stabilizing queues in stochastic networks and we have no such queues here, the framework allows us to convert our transmission power constraint into a set of <em id="S5.p4.3.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">virtual</em> queues and apply the Lyapunov convergence theorem to our problem.
The practical implications of the virtual queues will be explored at the end of this section and its effect will be further illustrated in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Experiments ‣ Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Stochastic Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.

For simplicity, we assume that the computation time is much less than communication time and do not include that in our time measurements.
The FEMNIST dataset is a federated partitioning of the extended MNIST (EMNIST) dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> that consists of 62 classes of handwritten letters and digits from 3597 different writers.
In the experiments, each device is given data from only one writer in order to simulate a more realistic heterogeneous data environment rather than partitioning by class as is sometimes done, e.g., in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S6.SS1.p2.5" class="ltx_p">In this i.i.d. data case, the advantages of our scheme are readily apparent as our selection policy consistently reaches testing accuracy values in less time compared to the uniform equivalent.
The achieved training speed up is more noticeable in the heterogeneous channel case since the algorithm picks the devices with bad channels less often.

<p id="S6.SS1.p3.3" class="ltx_p">We also note that the reason that the selection schemes that choose fewer devices per round, e.g., the <math id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda=100" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">λ</mi><mo id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">100</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜆</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">100</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">\lambda=100</annotation></semantics></math> and corresponding uniform cases, appear to converge to a higher accuracy faster is because they are able to complete more iterations in the given time frame.
So, while having fewer devices participate in a round generally results in a poorer quality update due to increased variance, it allows for the local models to be aggregated more quickly and thus can end up resulting in faster convergence in time.
In other words, quantity over quality wins out.
To illustrate the worse per round performance of the fewer device per round regimes, we plot the same results from Figure <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ VI-A CIFAR-10 Results ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Stochastic Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> in Figure <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VI-A CIFAR-10 Results ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Stochastic Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, but versus communication rounds rather than communication time.
We reiterate that larger <math id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1">𝜆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1c">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math> means fewer devices chosen per round on average.
It is clear that as <math id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1">𝜆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1c">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math> is increased, the testing accuracy converges more slowly per round and oscillates more intensely.
This reveals an interesting unsolved trade-off between the quality versus the speed of global updates in federated learning.
While the scenario and datasets considered here favor faster, lower quality updates, this might not always be the case.
For example, the optimal update policy will depend on things like the communication/channel model used and the computation time required to compute updates.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.7" class="ltx_p">Interestingly, in the homogeneous channel case (Figures <a href="#S6.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ VI-B FEMNIST Results ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Stochastic Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(a)</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F4.sf2" title="In Figure 4 ‣ VI-B FEMNIST Results ‣ VI Experiments ‣ Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Stochastic Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(b)</span></a>), the two selection strategies perform very similarly with a marginal increase in speed for our algorithm.
This is most likely due to the greater number of devices being chosen and the similarity in channel gain causing the algorithm to choose in such a way that is close to uniform selection.
For the heterogeneous channel gain case, on the other hand, the more varying channel gains causes the algorithm to choose the devices with better channels more frequently.
Since our algorithm guarantees that our algorithm converges even when training on non-i.i.d. data, the model still converges and benefits from the time saved using our device selection policy.
Another interesting note is that, in the heterogeneous case, the percentage of speed up is better for the <math id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda=10" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">λ</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜆</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\lambda=10</annotation></semantics></math> case than the <math id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda=100" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">λ</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">100</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">𝜆</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">100</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p2.2.m2.1c">\lambda=100</annotation></semantics></math> case.

Thus, our algorithm sacrifices not satisfying the constraint initially in finite time in order to make gains in performance, but always satisfies the constraint asymptotically.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied the affect of arbitrary selection probabilities for devices in federated learning and noted the challenge of scheduling devices in a heterogeneous wireless environment.
After deriving a novel convergence bound for non-convex loss functions, we formulated a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of the derived convergence bound and the total time spent on transmitting the parameter updates under a transmit power constraint.
By using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework, we developed an algorithm that analytically solves the formulated problem to find the optimal selection probabilities and transmit powers.
Our experimental results showed that even without knowledge of the channel statistics, a significant amount of time can be saved during the FL training procedure using our algorithm.
We used a realistic non-i.i.d. dataset known as FEMNIST to demonstrate how the algorithm might perform in practice and the results were very promising for heterogeneous wireless environments.
We also showed via the CIFAR-10 dataset that the gains can be even greater when the data is i.i.d..
Future work may consider multiple access communication schemes and seek to minimize the slowest of the chosen devices since aggregation will ultimately be waiting for the last update.
There is potential for many interesting directions by considering different objective functions to focus on different aspects of the FL process.
