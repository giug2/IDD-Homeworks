<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">By exploiting the computing power and local data of distributed clients, federated learning (FL) features ubiquitous properties such as reduction of communication overhead and preserving data privacy. In each communication round of FL, the clients update local models based on their own data and upload their local updates via wireless channels.
However, latency caused by hundreds to thousands of communication rounds remains a bottleneck in FL. To minimize the training latency, this work provides a multi-armed bandit-based framework for online client scheduling (CS) in FL without knowing wireless channel state information and statistical characteristics of clients.
Firstly, we propose a CS algorithm based on the upper confidence bound policy (CS-UCB) for ideal scenarios where local datasets of clients are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and balanced. An upper bound of the expected performance regret of the proposed CS-UCB algorithm is provided, which indicates that the regret grows logarithmically over communication rounds. Then, to address non-ideal scenarios with non-i.i.d. and unbalanced properties of local datasets and varying availability of clients, we further propose a CS algorithm based on the UCB policy and virtual queue technique (CS-UCB-Q). An upper bound is also derived, which shows that the expected performance regret of the proposed CS-UCB-Q algorithm can have a sub-linear growth over communication rounds under certain conditions. Besides, the convergence performance of FL training is also analyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The unprecedented amount of data and the increasing number of mobile devices, e.g., smart phones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, in wireless communication networks, together with the recent breakthroughs in machine learning (ML), are revolutionizing our way of life. While traditional ML frameworks rely on the availability of a large amount of data in a centralized computing entity, this is not always feasible in IoT applications due to: (a) the reluctance of sharing private data from the end users, (b) the growing security concerns, and (c) the large communication overhead required to transmit raw data to centralized ML processors. In response, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> was recently proposed to leverage massively distributed computing power, e.g., on IoT devices or smart phones, to collaboratively train a shared ML model without direct access to raw data. These devices, which are referred to as clients, train an ML model on their local datasets, respectively, and then upload their local model parameters (e.g., model weights or gradients) to a remote server for model aggregation. Thus, the massive amount of distributed and privacy-sensitive data on the clients can be well exploited without leak of privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, latency incurred by wireless transmission and local computation on clients remains a bottleneck in FL, since hundreds to thousands of communication rounds are required to reach a desired model accuracy, especially when the number of participating clients in the training process of FL is large <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Specifically, the large propagation latency caused by dynamic wireless environment and the large computation delay due to limited computing power of clients will degrade model performance, if with a limited training time budget. The approaches to reducing the training latency in FL proposed in existing works can be roughly divided into three main categories: update compression, over-the-air computation, and communication reduction.
Belonging to the first category, gradient quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and gradient sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> can be used to improve the communication efficiency. Besides, two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs: structured updates and sketched updates of model parameters were proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Recognizing the superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels, computation-over-the-air approaches which harness interference instead of suppressing interference are shown to be able to accelerate global model aggregation, such as broadband analog aggregation adopted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The last category has also been investigated in some works. For example, the adaptive communication strategies with dynamic local updates and with dynamic model aggregation were proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the aforementioned methods, client scheduling (CS) is also an important direction to reduce training latency in FL, especially in the scenarios with massive number of clients but limited wireless channels. Different scheduling criterions lead to different performance. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> only a portion of clients with fast response were chosen for aggregation and the stragglers with slow response were temporarily dropped in a certain communication round, in order to avoid a long wait for the stragglers. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> maximized the number of selected clients in each communication round. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed a scheduling policy by jointly accounting for the staleness of the received parameters and the instantaneous channel qualities. Another scheduling criterion is the update significance such as model variance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and gradient variance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Besides, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> considered a joint problem of wireless resource allocation and CS. Note that these works performed CS based on the assumption that some prior information is available, such as wireless channel state information (CSI) and computing resource usage of clients. However, it is not easy to have access to such information when the number of clients is greatly large. Secondly, most of these works, except for <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, only investigated the transmission time consumption of uploading local updates and distributing global model parameters, but did not take into account the computation time consumption of local training on clients. In addition, due to the potential “deep fade” of wireless channels or the exhausted computing power, some clients may lose their connectivity and be unavailable temporarily. Thus, the availability of clients during FL training is also a practical challenge, but was not considered in these existing works. Motivated by these facts, a new CS policy in FL training is proposed in this paper to deal with these practical challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, given the number of communication rounds required to achieve a certain level of test accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, we aim to minimize the total wall-clock time consumption including transmission time and local computation time. We consider a system where an access point (AP) equipped with a central processor serves a large amount of clients. However, only a limited number of wireless channels are available, i.e., the number of wireless channels is much smaller than that of clients. Thus, scheduling the appropriate clients to access to the wireless channels for parameter updating during different communication rounds is of necessity. We study the CS problem in FL in two scenarios: ideal and non-ideal scenarios. In the ideal scenario, the clients are always available and the dataset of each client is balanced and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In the non-ideal scenario, the clients are not always available during the FL training process and the datasets of different clients are unbalanced and non-i.i.d. Due to the lack of prior knowledge of training time of the clients, we need to learn the related statistical information while performing CS, so as to help make better decisions in the future. Thanks to the development of reinforcement learning technique, we reformulate the CS problem as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) program, which is a powerful tool for scheduling and resource allocation problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply the MAB tool to the CS problem in FL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.5" class="ltx_p">Besides the availability constraint, the non-i.i.d. and unbalanced properties of local datasets of the clients should be addressed. More specifically, the local dataset of any particular client cannot represent the distribution of the whole, and the sizes of the local datasets of different clients are different, because different clients have various activity characteristics. An effective solution to the considered issue is Federated Averaging approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> in which a subset of the clients are enrolled in the FL process in each round to cooperatively train a shared model.
However, the importance of the local datasets of different clients is different. Generally speaking, the local dataset which has a larger size and whose distribution is more similar to the global distribution plays a more important role, and the corresponding clients should participate in more communication rounds.
Thus, fairness constraint is introduced to “tell” each client that how many communication rounds they should participate in. The fairness constraint not only can avoid the occurrence of abandoning the slow but important clients due to the pursuit of low delay, but also can make the important clients be involved in more rounds by setting a large fairness factor.

We do not know either the dynamics of computing power of the clients or wireless CSI between the AP and clients, so that we cannot make the optimal decisions. In order to address this issue, we must learn some important information, i.e., the statistical information about time consumption of each client, from the feedback from the previous decisions. Besides, the fairness constraint and the availability constraint increase the difficulty in solving problem (<a href="#S2.E11" title="In II-D Problem Formulation ‣ II System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Multi-Armed Bandit Based Client Scheduling for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>).

The key idea behind this algorithm is that we observe the feedbacks for each arm, rather than for each super arm (or each action) as a whole. The same arm can be observed in different actions and we collect and exploit information about the reward of one certain arm from the operations of different actions, in order to make better decisions in the future.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.8" class="ltx_p">whose optimal solution is easy to find due to its linearity. However, the linear program is based on the assumption that the normalized expectation of each arm’s reward is known in advance, which is usually impractical. Thus, to achieve the maximal reward, the player (i.e., the AP) needs to estimate the mean rewards of the arms and exploit such knowledge to find out a super arm that seems to yield the highest reward, but also keep exploring further the other arms to identify with better precision which super arm is actually the best. Such a learning process is a typical exploration-exploitation tradeoff and inevitably leads to the reward loss, i.e., the regret <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.

It is worth noting that the coherence time of wireless channels is relatively short, thus the distribution process may experience multiple coherence time slots in a communication round. In other words, the wireless channel varies during the distribution process.

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Before showing the convergence performance, in addition to the existing baseline algorithms, we introduce another baseline algorithm, named local accuracy based scheduling, where the clients with lower local test accuracy have higher priority to be chosen in each round. The test accuracy with respect to the number of communication rounds of different algorithms is shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-B Performance in Ideal Scenario ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Multi-Armed Bandit Based Client Scheduling for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. We find that the convergence rate, in terms of the communication rounds, of the proposed CS-UCB algorithm in the ideal scenario is close to those of the baselines. This is because the local datasets of the clients are i.i.d. and the average number of the participating clients in each round is almost the same. Based on the results of Figs. <a href="#S5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ V-B Performance in Ideal Scenario ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Multi-Armed Bandit Based Client Scheduling for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a) and <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-B Performance in Ideal Scenario ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Multi-Armed Bandit Based Client Scheduling for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we can conclude that the proposed CS-UCB algorithm consumes less wall-clock time to finish the required communication rounds of a certain level of test accuracy.</p>

It is observed that the performance of the proposed CS-UCB algorithm is always better than those of the random scheduling algorithm and the round robin algorithm. Besides, we observe that the cumulative performance gap increases as the number of available channels increases because more clients can get involved in the FL process and then the probability of choosing the high-latency clients is increased.</p>

The test accuracy with respect to the number of communication rounds of the proposed CS-UCB-Q algorithm, as well as the baseline algorithms, is presented in Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-C Performance in Non-Ideal Scenario ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Multi-Armed Bandit Based Client Scheduling for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. It is shown that the achieved test accuracy of the proposed CS-UCB-Q algorithm is better than that of the three baseline algorithms. This is because the proposed CS-UCB-Q algorithm makes the clients with the important datasets participate in more rounds.

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Aiming to minimize the time consumption of FL training, this work considered the CS problem in both the ideal scenario and non-ideal scenarios. For the ideal scenario, we proposed the CS-UCB algorithm and also derived an upper bound of its performance regret. The upper bound suggests that the performance regret of the proposed CS-UCB algorithm grows in a logarithmic way over communication rounds. However, the local datasets of clients are non-i.i.d. and unbalanced and the availability of clients is dynamic in the non-ideal scenario. Thus, we introduced the fairness constraint to ensure each client could participate in a certain proportion of the communication rounds during the training process. We further proposed the CS-UCB-Q algorithm based on UCB policy and virtual queue technique and provided an upper bound which shows that the performance regret of the proposed CS-UCB-Q algorithm has a sub-linear growth over communication rounds when <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta\leq\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">β</mi><mo id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">≤</mo><mfrac id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">1</mn><msqrt id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">T</mi></msqrt></mfrac></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1"><leq id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></leq><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝛽</ci><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><divide id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"></divide><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">1</cn><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><root id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3a.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"></root><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">𝑇</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">\beta\leq\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S6.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> is large enough.
