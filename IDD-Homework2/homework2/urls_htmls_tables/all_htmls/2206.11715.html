<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays a significant role in the operation of electricity trading markets. Considering the growing concern of data privacy, federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted to train STLF models for utility companies (UCs) in recent research. Inspiringly, in wholesale markets, as it is not realistic for power plants (PPs) to access UCs’ data directly, FL is definitely a feasible solution of obtaining an accurate STLF model for PPs. However, due to FL’s distributed nature and intense competition among UCs, defects increasingly occur and lead to poor performance of the STLF model, indicating that simply adopting FL is not enough. In this paper, we propose a DRL-assisted FL approach, DEfect-AwaRe federated soft actor-critic (DearFSAC), to robustly train an accurate STLF model for PPs to forecast precise short-term utility electricity demand. Firstly. we design a STLF model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) using just historical load data and time data. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of defects occurrence, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is adopted to assist FL by alleviating model degradation caused by defects. In addition, for faster convergence of FL training, an auto-encoder is designed for both dimension reduction and quality evaluation of uploaded models. In the simulations, we validate our approach on real data of Helsinki’s UCs in 2019. The results show that DearFSAC outperforms all the other approaches no matter if defects occur or not.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In recent years, many countries and regions have gradually opened up their electricity trading markets, in which utility companies (UC) purchase electricity from power plants (PP) in a wholesale market, and then sell it to consumers in a retail market. As the number of UCs increases, Texas gradually occupies the largest share of the electricity trading market in the US. By November <math id="S1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2021" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">2021</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1">2021</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1c">2021</annotation></semantics></math>, more than <math id="S1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="110" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">110</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1">110</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1c">110</annotation></semantics></math> UCs have been operating in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">1</span></a>]</cite>. As power supply and demand have a significant influence on energy transactions, market shares, and profits in competitive electricity markets, a precise load forecast, especially short-term load forecasting (STLF), is essential for electricity price estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">2</span></a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the smart grid, with the widespread deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in various buildings, such as residential buildings, commercial buildings, industrial buildings, etc., approaches of STLF on electricity have been actively studied. The work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">3</span></a>]</cite> adopts long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal features in electricity consumption data of residential buildings, which has become a popular way in STLF. Based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">3</span></a>]</cite>, research on STLF using deep learning (DL) springs up. As UCs can collect abundant consumer profiles, such as historical load data, household characteristics, and behavior patterns through AMIs, STLF of residential buildings and communities is well developed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">4</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">5</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">6</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">7</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">8</span></a>]</cite>. In addition, there also exist some DL-based STLF approaches on industrial load data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">9</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">10</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">11</span></a>]</cite>, commercial load data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">12</span></a>]</cite>, hospital load data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">13</span></a>]</cite>, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To maintain the stability of electricity trading markets, STLF on UCs’ demand is also necessary for PPs. However, as there is a great competition of pricing in wholesale markets in Texas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">14</span></a>]</cite>, it is not realistic for PPs to gain UCs’ data. Besides, PPs have no AMIs or any other devices to access consumers’ profiles. Therefore, an approach of obtaining an accurate STLF model for PPs without intruding UCs’ data privacy is strongly needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the growing concern of protecting data privacy, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">15</span></a>]</cite>, which aims at providing general solutions while ensuring data privacy and security, is adopted in most research on STLF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">16</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">17</span></a>]</cite>, indicating the feasibility of adopting FL between one PP and UCs to help the PP obtain an accurate STLF model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the competition in wholesale markets is intense, implying that malicious UCs inevitably exist. Due to FL’s distributed nature, bad conditions increasingly occur in FL-based STLF model training on PPs. In this paper, we call all bad conditions <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">defects</span>. As stated in research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite>, malicious hackers or UCs can conduct various attacks, such as data poisoning attacks, to training data or trained models. Besides, uneven quality of communication can also introduce errors during uploading local models or downloading the global model. Thus, a robust design is eagerly required to be proposed, rather than simply adopting FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the challenge, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">19</span></a>]</cite> is adopted. In DRL, an agent is trained to interact with the environment, which has the strong capability of solving real-time decision tasks with significant uncertainty. As DRL becomes increasingly prevalent in solving problems which can be modeled as Markov decision process (MDP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite>, many studies of adopting DRL in smart grid emerge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">21</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">22</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">23</span></a>]</cite>. On the other hand, the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">24</span></a>]</cite> combines FL and DRL by selecting a certain number of clients from all clients through a DRL model to deal with image classification tasks. Motivated by the above works, we adopt a DRL algorithm to output the optimal weights for uploaded models so that the PP can aggregate model parameters to the global model which can be guaranteed an improvement in each round despite defects occurring.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As we know, there are just few works about adopting FL in probabilistic solar load forecasting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">25</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">26</span></a>]</cite>. Considering the mature development and wide deployment of deterministic load forecasting (DLF) in demand, we still construct STLF model based on DLF in this paper.</p>

As the PP just has historical data and time data, the STLF model should be capable of capturing hidden temporal features. Furthermore, during the FL process, considering different quality of uploaded models and various defects, the DRL model based on SAC is adopted to assign optimal weights to uploaded models to conduct efficient aggregation. Besides, just inputting model parameters into the DRL model will lead to curse of dimensionality and quite slow convergence. Therefore, QEEN is designed to reduce uploaded model parameters’ dimension and evaluate these models’ quality to provide more effective information for faster convergence of the DRL model.</p>

CL-LSTM is a general model trained on the whole dataset and lacks personalization. However, FL-based approaches use model aggregation to share parameters for preventing overfitting. Since the FL training process is not a convex problem, the distributed training manner may achieve a better performance when better sub-optimal solutions are found. (2) When defects reduce the model quality, errors are accumulated in the global model during the FL process. Due to DearFSAC’s capability of assigning nearly optimal weights to uploaded models, only DearFSAC can effectively conduct model aggregation for each FL communication round.</p>

Under Scenario II, III, and IV, FL-LSTM-SAC performs similarly well, showing the effectiveness of the DRL algorithm. Even so, DearFSAC performs better than FL-LSTM-SAC, proving the superiority of our proposed approach. On the contrary, the performance of the other two approaches is not so good. When DIAs occur, as shown in Scenario II, the forecasting results of CL-LSTM and FL-LSTM deviate from the actual demand, but the general trend is similar to the one of actual demand, indicating that DIAs can only affect the individual values of forecasting and have little impact on the tendency. Nevertheless, as shown in Scenario III, communication noises are seemingly capable of affecting the forecasting tendency of CL-LSTM, while the one of FL-LSTM is more stable. More severely, the mixed defects significantly harm the STLF performance of CL-LSTM and FL-LSTM, where FL-LSTM still seems to have a general trend similar to the actual demand. The reason is that through model aggregation, the global model can alleviate the impact of communication noises, whereas the errors are also accumulated in each FL communication round if defective models obtain respectable weights during model aggregation.</p>

As shown in Table V, the runtime of FL-based approaches is much lower than that of CL-LSTM, because the FL-based framework executes parallel local training in each UC to update models in a distributed manner. Besides, though DRL-adopted approaches cost more time than FL-LSTM, the runtime of FL-LSTM-SAC and DearFSAC is still acceptable. Furthermore, compared with FL-LSTM-SAC, DearFSAC’s runtime is even shorter. The reason is that directly inputting high-dimensional model parameters into the DRL model costs plenty of time, while QEEN spends a little time significantly reducing the model dimension for faster DRL computation.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, DearFSAC, a DRL-assisted FL approach, is proposed to robustly integrate STLF models for individual PPs. By adopting FL, one PP can obtain an accurate STLF model just using UCs’ local models, which protects data privacy. Considering defects, the SAC algorithm is adopted to conduct robust model aggregation. In addition, for better convergence of our approach, QEEN, an auto-encoder, is designed for both dimension reduction and quality evaluation of uploaded models. In simulations, our approach shows the superiority and robustness of the proposed approach in utility demand forecasting.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, we will focus on the following three aspects: 1) Stronger robustness considering more types of defects; 2) improvement under more distributed scenarios; 3) extension of more types of energy resources.</p>
