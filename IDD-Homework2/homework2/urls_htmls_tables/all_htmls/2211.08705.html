<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The Metaverse has received much attention recently. Metaverse applications via mobile augmented reality (MAR) require rapid and accurate object detection to mix digital data with the real world. Federated learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. Due to privacy concerns and the limited computation resources on mobile devices, we incorporate FL into MAR systems of the Metaverse to train a model cooperatively.
Besides, to balance the trade-off between energy, execution latency and model accuracy, thereby accommodating different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted combination of total energy consumption, completion time and model accuracy.
Through decomposing the <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">non-convex</span> optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, CPU frequency and video frame resolution for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.
Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm has better performance (in terms of energy consumption, completion time and model accuracy) under different weight parameters compared to existing benchmarks.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, we can develop intelligent machine learning models that reliably recognize and classify complicated things in the real world due to advances in deep learning. This breakthrough has motivated the advancement of Augmented Reality (AR) technology, which improves the human perception of the world by merging the actual world with the virtual space.
Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications operate on mobile platforms and allow users to access services through their devices’ interfaces. MAR and augmented reality (AR) further empower the Metaverse, which is considered the next evolution of the Internet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
By implementing machine learning technologies on devices, more intelligent MAR applications are developed in different Metaverse scenarios, such as entertainment, communications and medicine.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Imagine a Metaverse scenario where putting on a pair of glasses, and you can see descriptions of buildings, which is convenient for finding the destination during traveling.
Thus, in MAR for the Metaverse, rapid and accurate object recognition is critical in bringing digital data together with environmental aspects.
This scenario can be addressed by different approaches.
For example, mobile devices can upload their images to a proximate edge server with strong computing power to run deep learning algorithms to save computational latency and energy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we assume each AR user of the Metaverse can generate data for object detection tasks. For example, users can mark labels for images generated by AR devices and those images are used for training afterward.
To create an object detection model with high accuracy, we usually need to feed it with a large size of training data. Due to limitations of user privacy, data security and competition among industries, usually, the data is limited.
Besides, the concern around data privacy is rising. Related laws and regulations are appearing, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU), so it may be challenging to collect sensitive data together to learn a model.
Mobile devices offloading their training tasks to a cloud/edge server may raise privacy concerns.
<span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> Training a model solely on one device could be a solution, but the amount of data collected by one device may not be enough for training a good model.</span>
We then consider incorporating federated learning (FL) into the design of MAR systems for the Metaverse.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">FL can collaboratively train a machine learning model while preserving data on its local device distributedly. It is a special distributed learning framework proposed by Google in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In the FL algorithm of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, each device trains a model locally for a certain number of local iterations and periodically uploads its parameters to a server to build a shared global model. By incorporating FL, on the one hand, we can utilize the computation resources of each device. On the other hand, we do not need to upload video frames to a central server for training, which protects user privacy. We call such a system as FL-MAR system.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The hardware performance is improving continuously according to Moore’s Law <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and thus the computational resources of mobile devices will most likely become abundant in the future.
Therefore, it is worth investigating how to run machine learning experiments on mobile devices.
One MAR device usually has limited data, which may not be enough to train a good model solely. That is why we are considering integrating FL into MAR applications.
Each MAR device can benefit from joining FL.
FL only needs each device to upload its parameters to a server, and the server will send back the average parameter to each device.
Thus, each device can improve its model without sharing its data, which protects user privacy.
Hence, it is worthwhile to study the application of FL to MAR for building intelligence into the Metaverse.
<span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Moreover, there are other promising applications of FL in the Metaverse: 1) <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Personalized content recommendation</span>: With FL, the users have the ability to partake in services offered in the Metaverse, such as receiving visual content recommendations, while ensuring the
safeguarding of their privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. 2) <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Object detection</span>: FL could help enable users to identify and interact with visual objects in the Metaverse with the technology of mobile augmented reality (MAR). This is also the scenario we consider in this paper. 3) <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Training avatars</span>: FL could be utilized to train avatars powered by artificial intelligence to provide users with personalized experiences while protecting user privacy. Additionally, AR or virtual reality (VR) in the Metaverse is accompanied by the privacy leakage of sensitive information, such as gender, age, ethnicity, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Therefore, FL can help prevent the risk of privacy leaks to a certain extent. For more details on using FL for the Metaverse, interested readers can refer to recent survey/tutorial papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Applying FL to MAR applications for the Metaverse still has high requirements of device memory, computational capability6 and communication bandwidth.
There are several challenges to the deployment of FL to MAR applications: (1) Limited bandwidth results in long <span id="S1.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">latency</span> between clients and the server and, consequently, affects the convergence time of the global model. (2) A large amount of <span id="S1.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">energy</span> is needed because a satisfactory model requires quite a few local computation and communication rounds. (3) MAR devices may be in a low-battery condition while training. How to utilize its computational resources (e.g., computational frequency) and adjust video frame resolutions during training to save energy and time?
Besides, finding optimal resource (e.g., transmission power, bandwidth, CPU frequency, etc.) allocation strategies can save both communication and computation resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
An optimal resource allocation strategy will allow us to reduce the execution latency and energy consumption and accelerate the convergence of the global model.
Therefore, it is essential to consider adjusting bandwidth, transmission power and CPU clock frequency for each participating device to optimize energy consumption and completion time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, different scenarios have different energy and latency demands.
For example, connected autonomous vehicles in an intelligent transportation system require low-latency control decisions, while personal computers may tolerate higher latency to utilize the idle time to train their model.
Besides, the object recognition accuracy is related to the video frame resolution of MAR devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Higher resolution means higher computational latency and energy consumption.
Thus, it raises the following question: how to assign the transmit power, bandwidth, CPU frequency and video frame resolution to each user device to find the optimal trade-off between energy consumption, the total completion time and model accuracy of the FL-MAR system while accommodating different scenarios?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above question, we consider a basic FL-MAR model for the Metaverse with frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and formulate a joint optimization of energy, time and accuracy problem over the wireless network.
The objective function includes a weighted combination of total energy consumption, completion time and model accuracy.
The participating devices in FL are under power constraints and bandwidth constraints while pursuing as little energy, time consumption and much accuracy as possible.</p>

We extend the algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> to an MAR scenario for the Metaverse. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, we do not consider any optimization variable or objective function related to MAR. The optimization problem in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is to minimize the total energy and time consumption.
In this work, we add one more optimization variable—video frame resolution in the context of MAR for the Metaverse. The objective is to optimize energy, time, and model accuracy simultaneously.
To evaluate the impact of video frame resolution, object detection experiments are implemented on COCO dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> using the modified YOLOv5m <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> model.</p>

The resources related to energy consumption involve limited bandwidth, transmit power, local device’s CPU frequency and so forth.
Considering all devices joining each communication round via FDMA, a joint learning and communication problem was formulated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Then, the authors investigated how to allocate time, bandwidth, CPU frequency and learning accuracy to each device under a latency constraint. Similarly, instead of considering FDMA, Dinh <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> came up with an FL algorithm via time-division multiple access (TDMA) called FEDL and studied the trade-off between the convergence time and energy consumption of FEDL.
<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Some papers also studied user (i.e., device/edge) association to reduce energy or latency for FL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a resource allocation and edge association scheme in a cloud-edge-client federated learning framework and showed it to converge to a stable system point.

<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> introduced a solution to reduce learning latency in wireless federated learning by implementing model pruning and device selection. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> examined how imbalanced data distribution affected the convergence rate and the learning accuracy and presented algorithms that combined user association and wireless resource allocation.</span>

The previously mentioned approaches, which use remote clouds to ingest images or video streams, are still time-consuming and energy-intensive.
Besides, offloading tasks to cloud servers may incur privacy leakage.
In contrast, performing tasks locally ensures a faster experience and provides more secure privacy protection.
By incorporating the framework of FL, we allow performing model training locally on devices and periodically uploading their parameters to a base station to create a shared global model.
Without assuming that devices and servers have sufficient bandwidth, we investigate a more practical setting where the bandwidth between devices and servers is limited.
To reduce energy consumption and latency, we propose an energy-efficient MAR system for the Metaverse, where the weighted combination of energy consumption and total completion time is optimized.
In addition to service latency and energy consumption, learning accuracy is equally vital to Metaverse MAR systems. Thus, balancing service latency, energy consumption and learning accuracy is essential.
Although the above studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> consider latency and energy consumption, they did not take machine learning accuracy into account. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> investigated the trade-off between the latency and analytics accuracy in edge-based MAR systems and developed an algorithm to improve the system performance, but it failed to consider the energy consumption of MAR devices.
Although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> considered optimizing the video frame resolution, CPU frequency and the bandwidth of each user, its scenario was indoor without incorporating FL and it defined the transmission rate by using CPU frequency which was in a different context from ours. Moreover, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> optimized the resource allocation for each user in an MAR system, but they did not incorporate FL.
In our work, we maximize the accuracy for each local device while achieving low latency and energy consumption at the same time under a wireless communication scenario.
<span id="S2.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">We would like to mention that the sum of the accuracy of the local device as a part of the optimization objective function has also been considered in recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> on augmented reality, but <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> are not about federated learning and have simpler optimization problems compared with ours. </span></p>

Obviously, with the increase of maximum CPU frequency, the energy consumption of the benchmark algorithm is rising, which can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VII-B1 Different (𝑤₁, 𝑤₂) with fixed 𝜌 ‣ VII-B How does Our Optimization Algorithm Perform with respect to System Parameters? ‣ VII Experiments ‣ Resource Allocation of Federated Learning for the Metaverse with Mobile Augmented Reality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(a).

Compared with non-IID, the impact of the unbalanced dataset is smaller. The effect of unbalanced MNIST on the model is even smaller because MNIST is a simple task. Furthermore, the image resolution has a greater impact on the accuracy of CIFAR-10 compared with MNIST since CIFAR-10 is more complex.

For the unbalanced setting, we randomly allocate the number of samples to each client. We do not simulate the non-IID setting for this dataset because each image has several object categories. It is difficult to select images with one single label to simulate a pure non-IID environment. The batch size is set as 32.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our paper considers an optimization problem for the FL system with MAR for the Metaverse. The optimization variables include the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, CPU frequency setting and MAR video frame resolution of each participating device. By introducing three weight parameters, we optimize a weighted combination of the total energy consumption, completion time and model accuracy. By adjusting the weight parameters, our resource allocation scheme can be amenable to different requirements of the FL-MAR system for the Metaverse. We present an algorithm to solve the optimization problem via a rigorous analysis. The convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are also provided. In the experiments, we observe that our resource allocation algorithm outperforms the existing schemes.</p>
