<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative approach for enabling distributed machine learning while preserving user privacy, yet it faces challenges like communication inefficiencies and reliance on centralized infrastructures, leading to increased latency and costs. This paper presents a novel FL methodology that overcomes these limitations by eliminating the dependency on edge servers, employing a server-assisted Proximity Evaluation for dynamic cluster formation based on data similarity, performance indices, and geographical proximity. Our integrated approach enhances operational efficiency and scalability through a Hybrid Decentralized Aggregation Protocol, which merges local model training with peer-to-peer weight exchange and a centralized final aggregation managed by a dynamically elected driver node, significantly curtailing global communication overhead. Additionally, the methodology includes Decentralized Driver Selection, Check-pointing to reduce network traffic, and a Health Status Verification Mechanism for system robustness. Validated using the breast cancer dataset, our architecture not only demonstrates a nearly tenfold reduction in communication overhead but also shows remarkable improvements in reducing training latency and energy consumption while maintaining high learning performance, offering a scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for the future of federated learning ecosystems.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Collaborative model training in FL is achieved by breaking down the training process into local training and model aggregation stages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Each data owner conducts local training on its specific data partition and shares only intermediate results, such as gradients, for model aggregation. This communication can take place either at a centralized server or directly among data owners. The version of federated learning that employs a central server for coordinating model aggregation is referred to as centralized FL. Centralized FL aims to connect thousands of diverse, distributed devices into a cloud-based centralized server, where devices’ local models are directly transmitted to the cloud server. This traditional approach is plagued by issues such as limited wireless resources and long transmission distances, leading to unpredictable and unreliable communication that can severely impair training efficiency and model accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Addressing this critical bottleneck of communication inefficiency, the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework has emerged as a promising solution. By decentralizing the process, HFL employs a two-tier aggregation process where local parameter values are initially aggregated at edge servers, such as base stations, before undergoing global aggregation at the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This goal of significantly reducing communication overhead with the cloud lead to a client-edge-cloud hierarchical Federated Learning (FL) system, aiming to combine the reduced data access of cloud servers with the rapid updates of edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To enhance resource allocation and incentive design at the edge servers, decentralized edge intelligence has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> that employs a deep learning based auction mechanism. However, a significant limitation of existing HFL approaches is the dependency on a specialized, and often costly, edge server infrastructure that necessitates preliminary setup, rendering it impractical for dynamic edge environments. This underscores the need for innovative HFL strategies that are both cost-effective and flexible, capable of adapting to the ever-changing dynamics of edge computing environments without sacrificing efficiency or scalability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces a self-regulated clustered federated learning architecture, known as SCALE that transcends the conventional reliance on edge servers for clustering, by employing a Hybrid Decentralized Aggregation Protocol (HDAP) based on dynamic driver node selection. Our approach offers a direct, server-assisted mechanism for optimizing cluster formation that leverages Proximity Evaluation, integrating data similarity, performance indices, and geographical proximity to dynamically cluster edge devices. The process starts by prioritizing initial data preparation, where key components like feature variance and performance indices are computed at the client node, then securely transmitted to the global server for cluster formation. This ensures that clusters are intelligently formed, reflecting a balance between data relevance, device capability, and geographical proximity to enhance overall communication and computational efficiency. This strategy not only mitigates privacy and efficiency concerns but also significantly reduces the dependency on costly edge infrastructure, offering a scalable and flexible solution adaptable to the fluid nature of edge computing environments.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the inception of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, a significant objective has been to reduce the communication costs associated with Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, as pointed out by Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, there are limited existing techniques that alter the approach to user selection. Hartmann <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposes stratification based on contextual information about users, while Nishio and Yonetani <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> group users based on hardware characteristics. Author zheng in his paper talks about the uplink and downlink during communication between global server and client nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. We might see communications as not a big problem, provided if we have a enough bandwidth, but over communications will impact battery life.
Communication overload on global server and cost implications are commonly addressed open problems in federated learning architecture. on the other side, author Aroju talks about the energy aware systems in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a recent survey conducted by Zihao, efforts to enhance communication efficiency were explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Additionally, numerous studies have been undertaken in the past to achieve swift communication establishment and low latency between global server and client nodes, aiming for expedited data processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Research advancements in addressing communication bottlenecks in federated learning include the exploration of communication-efficient algorithms that minimize information exchange between the central server and nodes, such as federated optimization algorithms emphasizing local updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Quantization techniques compress model updates before transmission, reducing exchanged information size without significant performance loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Asynchronous federated learning allows independent node updates, reducing dependency on synchronized communication and enhancing scalability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Adaptive strategies for federated learning can be found in some of few research articles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. These advancements collectively contribute to more efficient and scalable federated learning systems by mitigating the communication challenges inherent in decentralized and distributed settings.</p>

The Operational Efficiency Score assesses edge devices’ performance in a federated learning setting by examining CPU utilization, energy consumption, network efficiency, and energy efficiency. This comprehensive metric evaluates how effectively a device manages its computational resources (CPU utilization), its power usage (energy consumption and energy efficiency), and its capacity to maintain stable communication (network efficiency). Leveraging this information, the global server can effectively cluster devices, aligning them based on their operational efficiency and resource optimization capabilities through a composite measure:</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To maintain the system’s operational continuity, we introduce a decentralized driver selection mechanism that takes place after decentralized weight exchange and averaging. This is also triggered upon the failure of a current driver node, alongside a health status verification mechanism to monitor the vitality of the communication channels. Several critical criteria ensure the elected driver optimizes the aggregation phase’s efficiency and effectiveness: Computational Capacity, Network Connectivity and Bandwidth, Battery Life or Energy Resources, Reliability and Availability, Data Representativeness, and Security and Trustworthiness.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Computational Capacity is essential for processing and aggregating data swiftly, while Network Connectivity and Bandwidth ensure fast and reliable communication with other devices. Battery Life or Energy Resources guarantee the device can sustain the increased workload without interruption. Reliability and Availability reflect a device’s historical uptime, indicating its dependability throughout the learning process. Data Representativeness is crucial for generating a global model that accurately reflects the collective dataset, and Security and Trustworthiness ensure the integrity of the data and the aggregation process, safeguarding against potential breaches or compromises. Together, these criteria form a comprehensive framework for selecting a driver capable of efficiently managing the complexities and demands of federated learning in an edge computing environment.</p>

These data-sets were shared across all client nodes in both identical and non-identical ways. We evaluated our approach in two distinct federated learning scenarios. Initially, we employed the breast cancer data-set within the traditional federated learning framework, and subsequently, we compared the results with the SCALE approach.</p>

Initially, both methodologies display comparable accuracies. However, as training progresses, SCALE demonstrates a subtle yet consistent enhancement in model performance metrics, including F1 scores, precision, recall, and ROC AUC values. This incremental improvement underscores the efficacy of SCALE’s distributed learning mechanism, which not only accommodates but leverages the diversity of data across nodes to refine model accuracy effectively.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A critical examination of the communication overhead, unveils SCALE’s strategic reduction of global server updates. The stark reduction from 2850 updates in the federated learning paradigm to a mere 235 under SCALE underscores a significant optimization in data transmission. This efficiency is pivotal in mitigating network congestion and minimizing latency, thereby enhancing the overall scalability of the federated learning system. Such an approach is not merely a technical improvement but a strategic reorientation towards more sustainable and efficient federated learning operations.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By significantly reducing the computational demands on the global server and optimizing the efficiency of data transmission, SCALE offers a cost-effective solution for federated learning deployments. This cost efficiency is particularly salient in cloud-based implementations, where computational resources come at a premium. The SCALE approach, therefore, not only enhances the technical performance of federated learning systems but also presents a financially sustainable model for large-scale deployments.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, this paper presents an innovative Federated Learning (FL) methodology that overcomes traditional challenges such as privacy concerns, high latency, and increased costs in distributed machine learning by eliminating edge server dependency and implementing a server-assisted Proximity Evaluation for dynamic cluster formation. This is based on data similarity, performance indices, and geographical proximity. Our approach includes a Hybrid Decentralized Aggregation Protocol that merges local model training with peer-to-peer weight exchange and centralized final aggregation, significantly reducing communication overhead. Additionally, Decentralized Driver Selection, Check-pointing mechanisms, and a Health Status Verification Mechanism enhance network efficiency, system robustness, and data privacy. Tested on a breast cancer dataset, our methodology drastically cuts communication overhead, improves training latency and energy efficiency, and maintains high learning performance, offering a scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving framework for advancing federated learning.</p>
