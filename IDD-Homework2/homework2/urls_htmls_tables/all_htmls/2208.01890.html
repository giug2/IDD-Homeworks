<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated edge learning (FEEL) technology for vehicular networks is considered as a promising technology to reduce the computation workload while keeping the privacy of users. In the FEEL system, vehicles upload data to the edge servers, which train the vehicles’ data to update local models and then return the result to vehicles to avoid sharing the original data. However, the cache queue in the edge is limited and the channel between edge server and each vehicle is time-varying. Thus, it is challenging to select a suitable number of vehicles to ensure that the uploaded data can keep a stable cache queue in edge server while maximizing the learning accuracy. Moreover, selecting vehicles with different resource statuses to update data will affect the total amount of data involved in training, which further affects the model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a vehicle selection scheme, which maximizes the learning accuracy while ensuring the stability of the cache queue, where the statuses of all the vehicles in the coverage of edge server are taken into account. The performance of this scheme is evaluated through simulation experiments, which indicates that our proposed scheme can perform better than the known benchmark scheme.</p>

However, vehicle data are often private and different vehicles are reluctant to share their own data with other vehicles, thus the central cloud is hard to achieve an accurate model due to the shortage of training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. To solve this problem, federated learning is introduced to protect vehicle privacy by sharing models rather than sharing the raw data of vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Specifically, each vehicle gets a local model by training the data locally and then uploads the local model to the central cloud. The central cloud aggregates the uploaded local models to get the global model and then sends the global model to vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In this way, the vehicle can get an accurate model while protecting its data. However, local training in federated learning can impose a large computational burden on vehicles with limited computational power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider a three-tier infrastructure including cloud, edge servers and vehicles. In edge servers, federated edge learning (FEEL) is employed. It can relieve vehicles’ burden and protect vehicle data between the vehicle and the central cloud. Specifically, the edge server collects and trains the vehicles’ data to get a local model, and then returns the result to vehicles to avoid sharing the original data. Afterwards, the central cloud collects and aggregates all local models from the edge servers to obtain the global model, then distributes the global model to the edge servers and the vehicles for their use, thus protecting the privacy of the vehicles while avoiding the computation workload on the vehicle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.

Note that in the FEEL system, the mobile edge computing (MEC) servers would not harm the users’ privacy through deploying a shuffler between the vehicles and each edge server, which can disrupt the data uploaded by the vehicles.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the FEEL system, the data uploaded by vehicles for training are temporarily stored in the cache queue of each edge server. The cache queue of each edge server is limited. For each edge server, if too many vehicles upload data to it, the cache queue becomes overflowed and unstable. If too few vehicles upload data to it, there will be insufficient data in the cache queue for training and thus deteriorating the accuracy of models. To get accurate models while keeping the queue stable, vehicles’ data should try to fill up the cache queue of the edge server. On the other hand, the training starts right after the local data arrives at the cache queue. Once the training is finished, the training results are sent back to the selected vehicles and the used training data will be deleted from the cache queue only when the channel condition is good enough. In this case, it indicates that data randomly leaves the cache queue accordingly. It is challenging to select a suitable number of vehicles to upload the data to the cache queue where the used data and the result leave randomly.
In addition, vehicles in the network have different resource statuses including remaining data amount, communication quality, remaining energy and survivability (i.e., time duration within the coverage of an edge server). Thus, considering the resource statuses to select vehicles is critical. To the best of our knowledge, there is no related work to improve the accuracy of the model by considering different vehicles’ resource statuses and queue stability for vehicle selection in federated learning, which motivated us to carry out this work.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we review the existing research work on the edge-assisted federated learning system. We first review the work related to the edge-assisted federated learning system where users train models locally, then review the work on the FEEL system where the edge servers assist users in model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, Ren et al. proposed an edge-assisted federated learning system where each user is equipped with a Central Processing Unit (CPU) or Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to speed up the training process, which overcomes serious privacy issues and long communication latency due to the heavy traffic towards the centralized node. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, Mohammad et al. regarded wireless access nodes as parameter servers (PS) in the edge-assisted federated learning systems, where users update their local model based on their local data and the global model which is received from the PS. After the local updates, users transfer their updated model to the PS over a wireless fading multiple access channel (MAC), which enables reliable transmission from users to PS. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, Zhu et al. designed a low-latency multi-access scheme for the edge-assisted federated learning systems to address communication latency issues and accelerate the learning process. It is proposed that the updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over broadband channels should be aggregated over the air by exploiting the waveform superposition property of a multi-access channel. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, Liu et al. studied over-the-air model aggregation in the edge-assisted federated learning system, where channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) is unavailable. It leverages the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to align the cascaded channel coefficients for CSIT-free model aggregation. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, Taïk et al. considered data characteristics in wireless scheduling algorithms in the edge-assisted federated learning system, which allocates bandwidth based on user data to minimize the training time and total transmission energy while maximizing user diversity. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, Mo et al. exploit the combination of communication and computation in the edge-assisted federated learning, in which both the communication resource allocation for global machine learning (ML) parameters aggregation and the computation resource allocation for locally updating ML parameters are jointly optimized, thus minimizing the total energy consumption of the user in a limited training time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, Zhu et al. proposed an efficient broadband analog transmission scheme in the federated learning system to overcome a communication bottleneck due to the resource sharing of edge devices. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, Ren et al. studied gradient averaging over participating devices in each round of communication in the federated learning system. They also proposed a scheduling policy to exploit both diversity in multiuser channels and the different weights of model updates from different edge devices, thus achieving the optimal trade-off between channel quality and model weights. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, Zeng et al. proposed power devices using wireless power transfer (WPT) in order to enable some energy-constrained devices to execute some power-hungry learning tasks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, Wang et al. studied an edge-based communication optimization framework in the federated learning system to reduce the number of the end devices which is directly connected to the parameter server thereby avoiding high latency and unnecessary communication. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, Lin et al. studied a social federated edge learning (SFEL) framework over wireless networks, where the potential social attributes among edge devices and their users can be exploited. They built a social graph model to recruit the trustworthy social friends as learning partners by considering the mutual trust and learning task similarity, thus enhancing the learning performance as well as the stability of the edge-assisted federated learning system. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, Albaseer et al. studied a federated learning model where the edge server is equipped with multiple antennas. They focused on searching for the optimal user resources, including the fine-grained selection of relevant training samples, bandwidth, transmission power, beamforming weights and processing speed to minimize the total energy consumption given a deadline constraint on the communication rounds. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, He et al. developed an importance-aware joint data selection and resource allocation algorithm in the edge-assisted federated learning system, which enables the user to select important data to improve learning efficiency. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, Su et al. proposed a dynamic data and channel adaptive sensor scheduling power control algorithm based on a residual feedback mechanism. The derived decentralized optimal solution can be used to compute both the channel state information and data importance to seize good transmission opportunities and important gradients. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, Sun et al. proposed an energy-aware dynamic device scheduling algorithm to optimize the training performance by considering an over-the-air edge-assisted federated learning system with analog gradient aggregation. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, Liu et al. focused on reducing the learning latency due to the limited local computing power and communication bandwidth. They introduced model pruning for wireless federated learning systems to reduce the neural network scale and maximize the convergence rate under the given learning latency budget via jointly optimizing the pruning ratio, device selection, and wireless resource allocation. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, Zhou et al. studied how to optimize the transmission power and bandwidth allocation based on user quality of experience (QoE). They proposed a low energy consumption bandwidth allocation algorithm, which allocates appropriate power to the device based on the computing power and channel state of the device, thereby reducing energy consumption. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, Cao et al. employed the transmission power control to reduce aggregation errors in the edge-assisted federated learning system. Different from conventional power control designs, they considered a new power control design aiming at directly maximizing the convergence speed, thus minimizing the mean square error. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, Fan et al. studied the over-the-air model aggregation in an edge-assisted federated learning system. They developed a message-passing-based algorithm to fulfill this estimation task with low complexity and near-optimal performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, Xiao et al. studied to select the appropriate vehicles to participate in learning tasks and optimize resource allocation under learning time and energy consumption constraints. By taking the vehicle position and velocity into consideration, they formulated a min-max optimization problem to jointly optimize the onboard computation capability, transmission power and local model accuracy to achieve the minimum cost in the worst case of FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, Nishio et al. studied a mobile edge computing (MEC) framework for machine learning (ML) technologies. They proposed a new FL protocol to mitigate the problem that the overall training process becomes inefficient for the client due to the limited computational resources or poor wireless channel conditions. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, Bao et al. proposed an edge computing-based joint client selection and networking scheme for vehicular IoT. The scheme assigns some vehicles as edge vehicles by employing a distributed approach, and uses the edge vehicles as FL clients to conduct the local model training, thus the optimal behaviors can be learned based on the interaction with environments. However, the above works only enable users to train local models, which will increase the communication overhead and computational burden of users.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, Luo et al. studied a three-tier FEEL system containing user, edge and cloud layers, where the edge server helps the user to do model training. They proposed an efficient resource scheduling algorithm to solve the problem of joint allocation of computing and communication resources for users, to minimize the consumed resources. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, Mhaisen et al. leveraged the edge computing paradigm to design a hierarchical FEEL system to solve the problem of poor global models due to the over-fitting of local models to local data. The system executes federated gradient descent on the user-edge layer and federated averaging on the edge-cloud layer. In this hierarchical architecture, they formalized and optimized this user-edge assignment problem such that edge-level data distributions turn to be similar, which enhances the federated averaging performance. However, although the users of the above-related works carry out model training through the help of servers to alleviate the communication overhead and the computational burden of users, none of them considered the selection of users in vehicular networks, which motivated us to start this work.</p>

Note that in the FEEL system, the edge servers would not harm the vehicles’ privacy through deploying a shuffler between the vehicles and each edge server, which can disrupt the data uploaded by the vehicles. The duration time that vehicles drive in the coverage of each edge server is divided into equal time slots. In each time slot, each vehicle in the coverage of the edge server calculates the resource statuses including remaining data amount, communication quality, remaining energy and survivability, then transmits its resource statuses to the edge server. Afterwards, the edge server will select some vehicles to upload data for training. Specifically, the edge server first estimates the number of selected vehicles based on the backlog of the current cache queue to satisfy the queue without overflowing and then determines which vehicles are selected according to the vehicles’ resource statuses to ensure that more data are involved in the training. After that, the selected vehicles first upload data to the shuffler, then the shuffler disrupts all the received data in a uniformly random permutation, afterwards the shuffler forwards the disrupted data to the edge server. The training starts right after data are collected, i.e., the data arrive at the cache queue of the edge server. The edge server updates the local models of the selected vehicles when the training is finished. Then, if the communication channel conditions between some selected vehicles and the edge server are good enough, the edge server sends back the training results to the corresponding selected vehicles and deletes the used training data from the cache queue. Otherwise, the used training data will be backlogged in the cache queue until the communication channel conditions between the edge server and some selected vehicles become good enough. Then the next time slot is started and the above process is repeated in order to update local model. When the vehicles in the coverage area of the edge server have no data to upload, the edge server uses these periods of time to upload the updated local model to the central cloud. When all edge servers upload their local models, the central cloud can aggregate the local models to achieve a global model and then feed back the new update global model to each edge server.

Specifically, the edge server first estimates the number of selected vehicles based on the backlog of the current buffer queue to satisfy the queue without overflowing and then estimates which vehicles are selected based on the priority of each vehicle, which is calculated according to the vehicle’s resource statuses, to ensure that a larger amount of data are involved in training.

However, the training for the random selection scheme stops at time slot 1137, but for our proposed scheme, the training would not stop until the time slot 1400. This is because that our proposed scheme considers the vehicles’ resource statuses to select more vehicles to upload data, which causes more data are involved in the training. In addition, the training accuracy with our proposed scheme is higher than that with the static selection scheme. Moreover, the convergence of the three schemes is essentially the same, because all the three schemes converge when the training contains a sufficient amount of data. The results above show that, our proposed scheme is better than the random selection scheme and the static selection scheme.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we considered a federated edge learning system for vehicular networks and proposed a new vehicle selection scheme for each edge server, which not only ensures the stability of the edge server’s cache queue but also improves the learning model accuracy where more vehicular statuses, including remaining data amount, communication quality, remaining energy and survivability are taken into account. Simulation results demonstrated that our proposed scheme can significantly improve learning accuracy while ensuring the queue stability as compared to other baseline schemes.</p>
