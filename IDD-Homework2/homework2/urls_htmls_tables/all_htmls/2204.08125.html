<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">As a distributed learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) faces the communication bottleneck issue due to many rounds of model synchronization and aggregation. Heterogeneous data further deteriorates the situation by causing slow convergence. Although the impact of data heterogeneity on supervised FL has been widely studied, the related investigation for Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) is still in its infancy. In this paper, we first define the type and level of data heterogeneity for policy gradient based FRL systems. By inspecting the connection between the global and local objective functions, we prove that local training can benefit the global objective, if the local update is properly penalized by the total variation (TV) distance between the local and global policies. A necessary condition for the global policy to be learn-able from the local policy is also derived, which is directly related to the heterogeneity level. Based on the theoretical result, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence based penalty is proposed, which, different from the conventional method that penalizes the model divergence in the parameter space, directly constrains the model outputs in the distribution space. Convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is also provided. By jointly penalizing the divergence of the local policy from the global policy with a <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> penalty and constraining each iteration of the local training with a <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local</span> penalty, the proposed method achieves a better trade-off between training speed (step size) and convergence. Experiment results on two popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) experiment platforms demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm over existing methods in accelerating and stabilizing the training process with heterogeneous data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) was proposed as a distributed
Machine Learning (ML) scheme where data from distributed devices are utilized for training without violating the user privacy. The idea has been successfully implemented (e.g. the Google Keyboard) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>
and attracted much research attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
One of the key challenges for FL is the communication bottleneck due to the frequent communication of big ML models. There are mainly two methods to mitigate the issue, i.e., reducing the communication workload per round and decreasing the number of communication rounds. To this end, model compression has been proposed to reduce the communication workload per round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and another line of research tried to improve the convergence speed to minimize the number of communication rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Unfortunately, data heterogeneity between difference devices significantly slows the convergence down <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As an important ML paradigm, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) trains the policy of an agent in an iterative way by interacting with the environment. In each time step, the agent makes a decision to manipulate the environment and receives a reward for its action, where the objective of the training is to maximize the long term reward<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Due to the distributed data and computing power in large-scale applications such as autonomous driving, the training of RL algorithms under the FL framework is inevitable. Unfortunately, many challenges faced by supervised FL, e.g., the data heterogeneity and communication bottleneck, are still valid and even worse for FRL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. For example, centralized policy gradient methods already suffer from high variance which is detrimental to the convergence speed and training performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and data heterogeneity imposes another layer of difficulty for the convergence of FRL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Data heterogeneity in FL refers to the situation where the data collected by different devices are not independent and identically distributed (IID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Despite its empirical success, FedAvg does not perform well on highly skewed non-IID data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. As a result, many innovative methods have been proposed to tackle the data heterogeneity issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Data-level approaches aim to modify the data distribution to address the root of the problem. For example, a data-sharing strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>
was proposed to create a small but globally shared dataset to mitigate the impact of heterogeneous data. On the other hand, algorithm-level approaches try to solve the problem by improving the local training algorithms. Along this line of research, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> added a weighted proximal term to the local objective function to constrain the divergence of the local model from the global model. Finally, system-level approaches focus on client clustering/selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and speed up convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The heterogeneity issue of FRL is different from that of the supervised FL and the related study is very limited
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. There are mainly two types of RL methods, namely, the action-value method and the policy gradient (PG) method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The first performs action selection according to the value function, while the second utilizes ML models to approximate the policy and update the policy by gradient based algorithms. Data heterogeneity affects different RL methods in different ways, and thus requires different solutions. For the action-value method, Lifelong Reinforcement Learning (LFRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> explored the combination of Q-learning and FL in real-world applications, where the knowledge learned in one particular environment is transferred to another. Federated RL (FedRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> considered the scenario where some agents can only observe part of the environment and have no access to the reward. To handle this issue, agents maintain their individual Q-networks in addition to the global Q-network, and exchange their predicted Q value for cooperation. For policy gradient methods,
Federated Transfer Reinforcement Learning (FTRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed an online transfer process to numerically align the scale of the observations and actions in different environments so that the policy learnt in one environment is portable to another. Given that devices of the same type may have different dynamics, a FRL architecture, which adopts Proximal Policy Gradient (PPO) and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> to FRL in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. This FRL scheme alternates between sharing gradient and transferring mature models to other agents. For offline learning, data heterogeneity exists in different
local datasets. To address this problem, Federated Dynamic Treatment Regime (FDTR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed the first federated policy optimization algorithm for offline RL. There are also works that aim to improve the communication efficiency with heterogeneous data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. For instance, Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (FMARL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed
to gradually decay the gradients during local training to avoid model divergence and improve communication efficiency. QAvg and PAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> theoretically proved that federated Q-Learning and federated policy gradient can converge in tabular case when agents’ environments are heterogeneous.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we will investigate the data heterogeneity issue in FRL systems whose agents employ PG methods with an advantage estimator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. For that purpose, we first classify the types of data heterogeneity in FRL and define the heterogeneity level. By analyzing the connection between the global and local objective functions, we prove that although it is possible to improve the global objective by updating the local policy according to the local environment, the local update must be properly constrained. Based on the theory, we propose an algorithm that utilizes a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence based term to penalize the local training for diverging too far away from the global policy and name it the FedKL algorithm. The proposed KL penalty will be referred to as the global penalty because it guarantees that the local training of one agent will not diverge too far away from the global policy. Note that this global penalty is different from the per-iteration penalty utilized in centralized RL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. We will investigate the benefits of adding the global penalty and how its interplay with the local per-iteration penalty helps mitigate the data heterogeneity issue in FRL. Experiment results show that FedKL is able to stabilize training and speed up convergence when compared with existing algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx and FMARL.</p>

So, the heterogeneity level serves as a penalty, i.e., the local policy’s contribution to the global objective is penalized by the heterogeneity level. In other words,
even if the local training is beneficial for the local objective, it may not help the global objective unless the improvement is larger than the heterogeneity level. We have more to say about this in the experiment result section.</span></p>

Moreover, despite it’s theoretical importance, the TV distance does not have a closed-form expression by far. Second, the advantage function has to be estimated by sampling. Third, one agent cannot access information of other agents, making it impossible to determine the coefficients in (<a href="#S3.E22" title="In III-C Connection between the Global and Local Objectives in FRL ‣ III Data Heterogeneity and its Impact on FRL ‣ FedKL: Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Reinforcement Learning by Penalizing KL Divergence" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">22</span></a>).

In particular, agents of the FedAvg system will perform local training utilizing the algorithm proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, with the local penalty term. Agents of the FedProx system will deploy the same algorithm as FedAvg and add the proximal term <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Agents of the FMARL system will deploy the same algorithm as FedAvg and utilize the gradient decay scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, agents of the proposed FedKL system will implement the same algorithm as FedAvg, but with the global KL divergence penalty.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of authors’ knowledge, there are few works focusing on the
data heterogeneity issue in FRL, making it difficult to find
benchmarks for comparison purpose. Therefore, we made several light-weight modifications to popular RL simulators to accommodate the FRL setting. There are two
widely used simulation environments for evaluating the performance
of RL controllers, namely the MuJoCo simulator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Some modifications are required to run FRL experiments in the above network. Fortunately, there are a few modifications proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) are not connected by a centralized controller but isolated agents. Each RL-controlled vehicle is able to observe the position and speed of itself, and that for the two vehicles ahead and behind it. As a result, each state is represented by a 6-dimensional vector. Since each agent is controlled by its local policy, every action is a scalar specifying the acceleration for the current time-step. Further assume that the average speed of all vehicles is accessible to all AVs.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">By default, AVs and human-driven vehicles are positioned alternatively,
as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ V-A2 Traffic Control by Isolated RL Agents ‣ V-A Experiment Platforms ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedKL: Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Reinforcement Learning by Penalizing KL Divergence" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3a</span></a>. If we utilize ‘h’ and ‘r’ to represent the human-driven vehicle and AVs, respectively, the default placement can be written as [h,r,h,r,h,r,h,r,h,r,h,r,h,r]. To simulate the heterogeneity due to different initial state distributions, we fix the starting position of all AVs such that everyone starts from the same position in each run.
Given the AVs have access to the information about the two vehicles before and after, we may create different environment dynamics by adjusting the placement pattern. For example, the car placement [h,r,h,h,r,r,h,r,h,h,h,r,r,r], as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ V-A2 Traffic Control by Isolated RL Agents ‣ V-A Experiment Platforms ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedKL: Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Reinforcement Learning by Penalizing KL Divergence" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3b</span></a>, will lead to different environment dynamics.</p>

It can be observed that with the same learning step size, FedKL can converge to a stable performance, but both FedAvg and FedProx may diverge or fluctuate. We can certainly reduce the step size for FedAvg and FedProx, but this will lead to slow learning speed. See next section for more related discussions.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the following, we show the results of Experiment 2 where both types of heterogeneity are present. The best performance of each algorithm is shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-C Advantage of the KL-based Global Penalty ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedKL: Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Reinforcement Learning by Penalizing KL Divergence" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, where the averaged total reward over three runs is reported.

As a result, all of them converge at a similar speed as FedKL, but they diverge after reaching the maximum reward. The above results provide empirical evidence that directly constraining the model output by KL divergence is more effective in handling the data heterogeneity than penalizing model divergence in the parameter space. Furthermore, applying a proper global KL penalty can prevent divergence from happening without loss of learning speed.</p>

For example, to achieve a total reward of 350 in Experiment 2, it needs around 110 rounds of communication for both FedAvg and FedProx, but only 50 rounds for FedKL, representing a saving of more than <math id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="50\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">50</mn><mo id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">50</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">50\%</annotation></semantics></math> of the communication workload.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another issue for large-scale FRL applications like autonomous driving is the model aggregation over many agents moving in a large area. A possible solution is the hierarchical FL scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, where aggregations happen in two layers. First, local aggregations among agents within a small region are performed on a local server. Then, the aggregation results from multiple local servers are sent to a global server for global aggregation. The local and global aggregations can happen with different frequencies, which may significantly reduce the communication workload. Unfortunately, the convergence analysis for the hierarchical scheme with data heterogeneity is not available, and it will be interesting to investigate the performance of FedKL under such a hierarchical framework.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the data heterogeneity issue in FRL systems. For that purpose, we first classified the types of data heterogeneity in FRL and defined the heterogeneity level. It was proved that although optimizing the local policy may improve the global policy, the deviation of the local policy from the global one must be properly constrained. A necessary condition for the local policy improvement to be beneficial for the global objective was also derived with respect to the proposed heterogeneity level. Based on the theoretical result, a KL-divergence based global penalty term was proposed, which was shown to be able to enable a larger local step size without causing model divergence. The convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is also provided. Experiment results demonstrated the advantage of the proposed scheme in speeding up and stabilizing the training. One conclusion we can draw from this work is that heterogeneity not only reduces the contribution of one agent’s local training to the global policy, but also increases the risk of divergence. It is thus important to balance between learning speed and convergence with a proper learning step size. Due to the lack of global information in the agents, a feasible solution is to maximize the learning speed and avoid divergence by jointly tuning the local and global penalty. In the future, a big challenge for implementing large-scale FRL is the model aggregation among many moving agents and it is critical to develop distributed aggregation schemes with heterogeneous data.</p>
