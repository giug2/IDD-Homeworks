<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">In the era of deep learning, federated learning (FL) presents a promising approach that allows multi-institutional data owners, or clients, to collaboratively train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. However, most existing FL approaches rely on a centralized server for global model aggregation, leading to a single point of failure. This makes the system vulnerable to malicious attacks when dealing with dishonest clients.
In this work, we address this problem by proposing a secure and reliable FL system based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology.
Our system incorporates a peer-to-peer voting mechanism and a reward-and-slash mechanism, which are powered by on-chain smart contracts, to detect and deter malicious behaviors. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that our framework is robust against malicious client-side behaviors.

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, machine learning (ML), or more specifically, deep learning, has transformed a broad spectrum of industries, ranging from finance to healthcare. In current ML paradigms, training data are first collected and curated, and then ML models are optimized by minimizing certain loss criteria on the training data. A common underlying assumption in the learning environment is that the training data can be instantly accessed or easily distributed across computing nodes without communication constraints, <em id="S1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.<span id="S1.p1.2.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em> data are <em id="S1.p1.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">centralized</em>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned concern, federated learning (FL) has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
In a typical FL system, a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is responsible for aggregating and synchronizing model weights, while a set of clients manipulate multi-site data.
This facilitates data governance, as clients only exchange model weights or gradients with a central server instead of uploading local data to the central server, and has led to FL becoming a standardized solution to utilize multi-site data while preserving privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Though FL perfectly implements <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data decentralization</em>, a trustworthy central server is required in the system. In such a system design, the central server in fact has privileges over clients, as the central server determines the global aggregation and synchronization. If the central server is compromised or manipulated by a malicious party, the clients are vulnerable if the central server intentionally distributes problematic model updates. This can potentially increase the cost of system management and maintenance. Towards avoiding this single point of failure, many efforts have been made to decentralize the central server, and one particularly promising solution is to use a blockchain as decentralized storage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Originally proposed for cryptocurrencies, a blockchain is a distributed ledger that can record the state transition information among multiple parties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, without relying on a centralized server. Blockchain technology has gained widespread attention for its potential to revolutionize a variety of industries, such as finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and supply chain management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. By leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain, FL can benefit from increased security, privacy, and efficiency, as well as reduced reliance on centralized servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Concretely, in FL with blockchain, each client participating in the learning process uploads their local model updates to the blockchain, where they are stored in <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">blocks</em>, the metadata of a blockchain system. These blocks are then used to aggregate the local model updates into a global model, which can be downloaded by the clients. The use of blockchain <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">smart contracts</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which are computer programs triggered by blockchain events, ensures that the global aggregation process is performed automatically and transparently, without the need for human intervention or centralized control.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Though integrating blockchain with existing FL systems can partially solve the threat to the central server, FL systems are still vulnerable to client-side malicious attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In this work, we define malicious behaviors as actions that intentionally decrease the learning performance (<em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.<span id="S1.p6.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em> accuracy and convergence) of the global model.

<em id="S1.p7.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">The Resistance</em>, on the other hand, has two mismatched competing parties, where the party with a larger size is denoted as the resistance force and the other party is denoted as the spies. In <em id="S1.p7.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">The Resistance</em>, there is a voting mechanism where, in each round, each player conducts independent reasoning and votes for a player, and the player with the highest votes will be deemed as a “spy” and kicked out of the game. The goal of the resistance force is to vote out all the spies while the spies aim to impersonate the resistance force and survive until the end. Based on these two concepts, this work proposes a novel majority-voting mechanism for global aggregation where each participating client independently validates the quality of aggregated local updates and votes for acceptance of the global update. The aggregation mechanism is stake-based where participating clients stake assets<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>In practice, the staked assets can be linked with cryptocurrency or real currency to increase the financial cost of malicious attacks.</span></span></span> or <em id="S1.p7.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">tokens</em> (a quantitative measurement of the asset, which can be used to indicate the trustworthiness of the client in our system) for their own actions. There are two types of actions, proposing (uploading local updates) and voting. If the majority vote is to accept the global aggregation, a proposer will be refunded with its staked tokens and a voter who votes for acceptance will not only be refunded but also be rewarded with the staked tokens from the voters who vote for rejection, and vice versa. The overall procedure of the stake-based aggregation mechanism is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Defending Against Malicious Behaviors in Federated Learning with Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of FL comes from the necessity of on-device training, where the training data have to remain on the device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
The clients of FL are distributed at different physical locations that are connected to the internet, which exposes a few security risks compared with distributed learning. First, as the local dataset belongs to the client, FL has to take the users’ privacy into consideration. This can be addressed by integrating privacy-preserving techniques into FL, such as differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Second, FL can be manipulated via internet access, <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em> the central server can be compromised by a third party. Third, a new client could participate in the federated training at any time if it meets the required criteria. This means that clients with malicious intentions can also join the federated systems while meeting the initial criteria. This work focuses on the third risk as the second risk is mitigated by replacing the central server with a blockchain. Traditional FL methods can only detect and defend the malicious clients via assigning small weights to malicious clients during global aggregation based on the divergence of learned parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> or using unsupervised learning methods (<em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em> anomaly detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and clustering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>) to get rid of malicious clients. However, none of these methods tackles the second challenge and these methods do not consider the third challenge. The proposed framework utilizes the blockchain to ensure the security of global aggregation and defends the client-side malicious behaviors with a novel majority-voting mechanism.</p>

The sender initiates the transaction by creating a digital signature that includes the transaction details and the sender’s private key, which is used to verify the sender’s identity and authorize the transfer. The transaction is then broadcasted over a P2P network to <em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">miners</em>, who are participants in the network responsible for verifying and adding new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. Miners validate and confirm the transaction using consensus protocols, to ensure that the transaction is legitimate and not a duplicate or fraudulent transaction. Once confirmed, the transaction is added to a block, which is then cryptographically linked to the previous block using hash functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, forming a chain of blocks (<em id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em>, blockchain). The block is then propagated to all the participants in the network, creating a decentralized, immutable record of the transaction. Finally, the recipient can access the digital asset by using their private key to authenticate their identity and claim ownership of the asset. The use of cryptography and consensus protocols ensures the security, transparency, and decentralization of the transaction process, making blockchain technology a promising solution for a variety of applications beyond cryptocurrency, e.g., insurance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, supply chain management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, energy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another key feature of blockchain technology is the use of smart contracts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which are quasi-Turing-complete programs that can be executed within a virtual machine. When a transaction is initiated, a smart contract is typically used to encode the terms and conditions of the transaction, such as the amount, currency, and time of transfer. The smart contract is then stored on the blockchain network and executed automatically when the predefined conditions are met. The execution of the smart contract verifies the transaction, ensuring that it meets the agreed-upon terms and conditions, and then automatically transfers the digital asset or currency to the recipient. Smart contracts can be leveraged to build a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps), such as decentralized finance (DeFi) services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional FL faces challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, such as privacy and security concerns, unreliable communication, and difficulty in reaching a consensus among the parties. Blockchain, on the other hand, provides a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform for data storage and sharing. This makes the use of blockchain for FL a promising direction to potentially address privacy and security concerns by allowing parties to keep their data private while still contributing to the training process. Additionally, blockchain can provide a secure communication channel for FL participants and ensure the integrity of the FL process.</p>

Despite the potential benefits of combining FL with blockchain, several challenges remain. For instance, FL systems are still vulnerable to client-side malicious attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and lack incentive-compatible mechanisms to motivate FL participants to behave honestly during the training process.
Multiple reputation-based incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> have recently been proposed to encourage participants and enhance model accuracy in blockchain-based FL. However, it remains unclear how to effectively utilize the blockchain infrastructure and leverage its inherent incentive mechanism (i.e., cryptocurrencies) to incentivize trustworthy FL behaviors and penalize malicious clients.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">The definition of malicious behavior in this work is an action that intentionally decreases the global model performance. There are two types of actions for each client that interact with the federated system, <em id="S3.SS2.p1.4.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.<span id="S3.SS2.p1.4.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em> a client can propose (<em id="S3.SS2.p1.4.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.<span id="S3.SS2.p1.4.2.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em> be a <em id="S3.SS2.p1.4.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">proposer</em>) and vote (<em id="S3.SS2.p1.4.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.<span id="S3.SS2.p1.4.4.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em> be a <em id="S3.SS2.p1.4.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">voter</em>). Proposing is to upload local model or gradient updates to the parameter server, while voting is a peer-review process to validate the “virtually” aggregated model updates. The technical details of the two actions are described in Sec. <a href="#S4" title="4 Method ‣ Defending Against Malicious Behaviors in Federated Learning with Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. There are thus two corresponding malicious behaviors. The first malicious behavior is to propose harmful local model updates and the second one is to vote dishonestly.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As there are two independent actions, there are two parallel reward-and-slash designs for proposing and voting. For both actions, the randomly selected proposers and voters are required to stake a fixed sum of tokens before they act. If some of these actors fail to stake (they do not have enough tokens left), they lose their access to the blockchain and are removed from the FL system permanently. Proposers will be rewarded with tokens accumulated in an independent pool (if there are any tokens left in the pool) if the global aggregation is approved and lose their stakes if the global aggregation is rejected. The reward-and-slash design for the proposers is illustrated in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 4.4 Asset Redistribution ‣ 4 Method ‣ Defending Against Malicious Behaviors in Federated Learning with Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. For the voters, the majority party will not only take back their stakes but also be rewarded with the staked tokens lost by the minority party. The reward-and-slash design for the voters is illustrated in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 4.4 Asset Redistribution ‣ 4 Method ‣ Defending Against Malicious Behaviors in Federated Learning with Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

Further, the proposed method requires more computational power than traditional methods due to mining (blockchain computing) and voting. Finally, large models have gained in popularity in practical applications, <em id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.<span id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.1.2.1" class="ltx_text"></span> missing</em> ViT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> and GPT-3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we explore an under-explored research direction, namely using FL and blockchain to defend against malicious behaviors. The defense mechanism is twofold. We use on-chain smart contracts to replace the traditional central server and propose a stake-based majority voting mechanism to detect client-side malicious behaviors. We not only provide a solution to the problem of interest, an emerging direction on trustworthy ML, but also show the robustness of the proposed method and provide the first empirical understanding of the problem.</p>
