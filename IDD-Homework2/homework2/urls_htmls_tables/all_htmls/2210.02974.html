<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Due to the growing interest for increasing productivity and cost reduction in industrial environment, new techniques for monitoring rotating machinery are emerging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the approaches that has been proposed to analyze the collected data (e.g., vibration signals) providing a diagnosis of the asset’s operating condition. It is known that models trained with labeled data (supervised) achieve excellent results, but two main problems make their application in production processes difficult: (i) impossibility or long time to obtain a sample of all operational conditions (since faults seldom happen) and (ii) high cost of experts to label all acquired data. Another limitating factor for the applicability of AI approaches in this context is the lack of interpretability of the models (black-boxes), which reduces the confidence of the diagnosis and trust/adoption from users. To overcome these problems, a new generic and interpretable approach for classifying faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented synthetic data to real rotating machinery is here proposed, namelly FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI). To provide scalability using transfer learning, synthetic vibration signals are created mimicking the characteristic behavior of failures in operation. The application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) with 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) allows the interpretation of results, supporting the user in decision making and increasing diagnostic confidence. The proposed approach not only obtained promising diagnostic performance, but was also able to learn characteristics used by experts to identify conditions in a source domain and apply them in another target domain. The experimental results obtained on three datasets containing different mechanical faults suggest the method offers a promising approach on exploiting transfer learning, synthetic data and explainable artificial intelligence for fault diagnosis. Lastly, to guarantee reproducibility and foster research in the field, the developed dataset is made publicly available.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, with the great need to increase the amount of final product manufactured, the industry has been looking for ways to monitor its assets in order to avoid unexpected breaks that can directly impact production <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Due to the growing demand, searches for alternatives in the monitoring of rotating machinery have been commonplace, leading to a large amount of information and research being generated: from the definition of informative signals to the development of smart data processing techniques, from new sensors to new best practice in data acquisition and monitoring.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The increase in information generates a need for experts to achieve quick analysis and effective diagnosis. Thus, artificial intelligence models have been proposed to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of assets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> present a review of the main Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques applied in the monitoring of induction motors, aiming to detect faults such as: broken bars, bearings failures, stator failures and eccentricity. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> also present a review on artificial intelligence for fault detection in rotating machinery, in which more than 100 cited references refer mostly to fault classification (fault diagnosis). More recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> presented a comprehensive review with more than 400 citations, focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for fault diagnosis, providing a historical overview, in addition to current developments and future prospects. Further details on the state-of-the-art in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">By analysing the aforementioned studies, it can be noted that, for the task of monitoring rotating machinery, AI models have high accuracy rates when trained in supervised condition, ie. in the presence of labeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> representing both normal and faulty conditions. Unfortunately, the supervised scenario is difficult to be applied in real world industrial settings, for two main reasons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">i) <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Faults rarely happen in real world</em>: by design, equipment are made to be ideally operating all the time in a normal condition, therefore not providing sample labels for faulty conditions. When a fault manifests itself, the MCP (Maintenance Planning and Control) team schedules as soon as possible the corrective maintenance for repair or replacement, which results in a low number of acquired signals of fault conditions. In most conventional AI models, unbalanced datasets are associated with many issues, like for example low capability of prediction the least represented class, as the model tends to learn more about the condition that is most presented to it;</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">ii) <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">High cost to obtain and label data</em>: with the development of AI approaches in the industry, more complex and sophisticated models are being used, like DL approaches; this is due to the fact that DL techniques can, among other things, automatically extract features from raw signals and can achieve high performance. This reduces the expert’s intervention in feature engineering, a fundamental process for using conventional machine learning models. However, for successful training, such models require great amount of data, which is time consuming to obtain or not always feasible. To label the acquired data, experts are typically required: although the vast majority of faults have their characteristic behaviors known, the analysis requires specific knowledge that is not always available within the team.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">transfer learning</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> approaches can overcome such weaknesses by applying the knowledge learned from one task (or multiple tasks) to new, related, ones. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> present some approaches developed with a focus on transfer learning, showing that transfer-learning theories can alleviated the lacking labeled samples and enhancing the applications of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) in industry, in such works several approaches are considered, namely: feature-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, generative adversarial network (GAN) based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, instance-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and parameter-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Despite the promising studies, the vast majority of approaches are based on obtaining at least the Source Domain (samples on which the models will be trained) with real and labeled signals, which does not fully solve the aforementioned problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In order to reduce the need for labeled real data, a few recent studies propose the use of synthetically generated data from numerical and physical models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Among the studies, stands out the methodology presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>; in the study, a simulation-driven machine learning for bearing classification is proposed where training signals were generated from high resolution simulations in Siemens LMS Imagine. Lab Amesim simulation software using the one-dimensional 3-DOF model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. As with the other works, despite the satisfactory results obtained, the approaches are limited in terms of adjustment of boundary conditions, element properties, definition of solvers, model complexity, and application to only one type of failure (in this case, bearing fault), which can limit large-scale industrial applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly to the problem of obtaining a complete and labeled training set, the adoption of AI models in the industry comes up against its interpretability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Called Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), the area has been showing great interest by researchers, and is identified as one of the solutions to bridge the gap between AI researches and engineering applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Many models are considered as black boxes, that is, the user responsible for receiving the diagnosis does not know how the model reached the final conclusion. By not knowing exactly how or which features of the signal the model was based on for decision making, the reliability of the diagnosis is compromised, implying even the non-use of the model. To solve this problem, studies have been developed to explain why the model obtained the final classification. Among the techniques that provide visual explanation, the state-of-the-art technique in post-hoc methods is Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). As faults in IFD using vibration are generally identified through a visual analysis of the signal in the frequency domain, it is interesting to provide a heatmap overlaid on the input signal, identifying the most relevant frequencies for the classification. Despite the wide application in other areas, at present, Grad-CAM algorithm is seldom used in AI models for fault diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the problems presented, a new interpretable approach for classifying faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented synthetic data to real rotating machinery is proposed, namelly FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI). The approach starts from the concept where, transfer learning models focus on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, instead of working on fine-tuning, or retraining the model, the approach focuses on synthetic creation of the source domain: in this way the trained model learns features, which allow the transfer knowledge through the shared features of the source and target domain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">In FaultD-XAI, we propose to train the AI model with synthetic signals. The signals are generated from the knowledge about different faults in rotating machinery combined with the original signal of the machine under analysis, avoiding the use of complex mechanical models. The original signal is used only as a reference to create the synthetic signals, not requiring samples of all possible failures, which solves the problem of lack of labeled data in training set and enables engineering applications. To increase the variability of the training dataset, and consequently the robustness of the AI model, signals are generated using data augmentation techniques. To avoid the need to perform featuring engineering, reduce the computational cost, and enable the model’s interpretability through the use of Grad-CAM, 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) is used. Vibration signals in frequency domain are used, bringing the analysis as close as possible to that performed by experts. Due to the importance of rotors, bearings and gears for rotating machinery and especially their respective faults, three datasets are used for validation of the methodology, each one being related to a respective component and its possible faults.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">The use of synthetic data makes it possible to apply the AI model in different rotating machinery even without having real signals in all operating conditions. Such ability can be seen as a transfer learning approach, since the proposal can be used in any type of machine, just by modifying the reference signal. In addition, the model is trained with a dataset belonging to the source domain, which, in turn, presents a difference from the signals present in the target domain. The data augmentation of the data allows the model to be implemented quickly, since few collections are enough to generate the training data. Finally, the interpretability of the FaultD-XAI allows the user to have reliability and confirm the diagnosis, enabling its implementation, and even, for the person responsible for the development of the model, to verify the coherence of the learning during the training phase, allowing adjustments if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p13" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p13.1" class="ltx_p">The main contributions of the proposed approach are: i) a new transfer learning classification approach based on a synthetic dataset, without the need to have signals of real fault conditions; ii) possibility of interpreting the way in which the final result was obtained by the model, supporting decision making (a new contribution to the study of XAI in fault diagnosis); iii) a generic and simple way to generate synthetic fault data for training, based on the knowledge available in vibration analysis, without the need for complex models; iv) possibility of generating varied training datasets of different sizes (data augmentation - targeting deep learning applications); v) new dataset, publicly available at the link: <span id="S1.p13.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zx8pfhdtnb/1</span>, to study failures such as: unbalance, misalignment and looseness; vi) possibility of application in different types of faults; vii) faster deployment of the model in production; viii) industrial application on real world datasets.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. The high efficiency of CNNs and the ability to extract features from the raw signal without the need for feature extraction or engineering make them basic tools in many 2D applications such as images and videos. The fact of being able to extract features automatically from the raw signal, avoids a lot of analysis and signal processing that need to be done when working with other techniques, such as those shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, several research works involving vibration signals and deep 2D CNNs were carried out, where researchers adopted signal processing strategies to convert the original 1D signal to 2D, and thus be able to use the architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.

After pre-processing the data, the model is created and trained, enabling the diagnosis of the machine’s condition (fault diagnosis). Finally, the model is explained, identifying the most relevant frequencies used for classification, supporting the user’s decision making.</p>

In applications where data is available, it takes a lot of time and cost with experts to label and analyze all signals. A strategy to overcome this problem is to create the training dataset synthetically, since the vast majority of faults in rotating machines have known characteristic patterns.</p>

It is worth mentioning that the way the FaultD-XAI is proposed, other faults can be modeled and added, without changing its functioning (e.g., cavitation, electrical defects, oil whirl and oil whip etc). It is up to the specialist to determine the synthetic faults that will be created referring to the machine under analysis. It is also important to highlight that the methodology applies to stationary operating conditions, considering that the faults are created as a function of certain frequencies, which are mostly associated with the rotation frequency of the machine.</p>

Since, according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> and the experience of experts in vibration analysis, a variation of less than 3 dB does not represent a significant change in the behavior of the machine in terms of predictive maintenance or failure. The amplitudes are randomly generated to represent different stages of fault, and improve the robustness of the AI model (greater variability in the training group).

Such defects not only cause variation in the GMF and its harmonics, but in general, also present sidebands of the rotating speed of the defective gear. Therefore, the faults were simulated using Eq.(<a href="#S3.E2" title="In 3.2 Signal Generation ‣ 3 Proposed approach: FaultD-XAI ‣ Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI: a Transfer Learning-based Approach for Rotating Machinery exploiting Augmented Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) where, the frequency for each signal is given by GMF and its harmonics (1x, 2x, 3x GMF) and by the sidebands (GMF +/- rotating speed of the defective gear).

Deterioration will cause characteristic frequencies in the signal allowing fault identification. The four frequencies are: i) BPFO (Ball Pass Frequency Outer); ii) BPFI (Ball Pass Frequency Inner); BSF (Ball Spin Frequency); iv) FTF (Fundamental Train Frequency). The calculation basically takes into account: the number of elements, internal and external diameter, contact angle, and its equation can be easily found in vibration analysis software, supplier catalogs and existing literature.</p>

Although the inner race fault (BPFI) was not present in any of the cases studied, it was introduced to increase the complexity of the training and also validating the FaultD-XAI.</p>

In addition to increasing the amount of data for training, it is possible to insert small variations that, do not change the general context of the sample (although they exist). Some popular techniques are: flip, rotation, scale, crop, translation, gaussian noise. This makes the model able to correctly classify the sample, even if it presents noise, translations, different size, lighting etc. Performing augmentation can prevent the model from learning irrelevant patterns and consequently improve overall performance.</p>

In an industrial plant, machines are subject to process variations, human interference, disturbances from nearby machines that can introduce extra information into the signal. Therefore, a robust classification model should be irrelevant to such variations, focusing only on identifying the operating condition of the asset under analysis.</p>

However, there are certain drawbacks and limitations of using such deep CNNs: i) high computational cost and special hardware for training; ii) requires massive size dataset for training to achieve reasonable generalization capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Factors that are not always available when it comes to industrial applications involving vibration signals. In addition, vibration signals are in 1D, which would make it necessary to modify their dimension, further increasing the computational cost and need for pre-processing. On the other hand, 1D CNN makes it possible to use the vibration signal in its original dimension. It has low computational cost compared to 2D CNN and is well-suited for real-time and low-cost applications especially on mobile or hand-held devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.

As shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> even though the rotating machinery is diversified, some common essential rotating parts are: rotors, rolling element bearings, and gears <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the datasets were chosen and developed to address the main faults present in rotating machinery components, namely: defects in bearing and gearbox, misalignment, unbalance and mechanical looseness. The use of different datasets aims to validate the proposed methodology in different scenarios. As they are publicly available datasets and already explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, Case 1: Bearing Dataset and Case 2: Gearbox Dataset will be briefly discussed.

This approach can be seen as an analogy of the study area called Few-Shot Learning, where few samples are used to train the model. Another analysis performed is in relation to the total amount of real samples needed in the training group to ensure the stability and robustness of the model. In addition, the possibility of working with 100% synthetic samples was analyzed, that is, where synthetic data are generated without dependence on the real sample. For comparison between training forms, supervised training was performed, using only real signals, which were divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing.

It is known that, not all companies have enough specialized technicians to carry out an assembly and adjustment within the World Class Maintenance (WCM) standards. Also, there is a lack of specialized equipment to perform laser alignment, dynamic balancing etc. Moreover, due to the need for quick intervention to release the equipment for operation, maintenance cannot be performed with the desired precision. Because of these problems, the vibration signal can present a series of frequencies and/or noises, which make it difficult for the predictive maintenance specialist to analyze the main condition.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike the other conditions, in the first test, all signals for the training group were generated synthetically, without performing the combination with the real signal (zero number of real signal). It can be seen in Fig.<a href="#S5.F7" title="Fig. 7 ‣ 5.3 Number of real samples for training ‣ 5 Results and discussion ‣ Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI: a Transfer Learning-based Approach for Rotating Machinery exploiting Augmented Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, that with zero real signal the lowest performing test was achieved. This result was expected, since the signals were created, basically containing the machine rotation frequency, white noise and random frequencies with amplitude close to the noise. This characteristic does not represent the dynamic behavior of the machine, resulting in the lowest value obtained. Therefore, it can be concluded that using the chosen strategy, it is not possible to train a model using only synthetic data without the combination with the real signal. It is worth mentioning that, despite not being the focus of the work, other strategies, such as more complex modeling, can be tested to overcome this problem.</p>

This occurs because if one of the selected signals presents some noise or excitation not related to the dynamic behavior of the machine, such pattern will be replicated for at least 50% of the training set signals, leading the model to error.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The increase in the number of signals tends to contribute to the improvement in the performance of the model, although it does not mean a linearly increasing behavior. It is noted that, in general, there is a stabilization of accuracy and standard deviation after 15 signals. In view of the computational and acquisition cost, and the results obtained with the increase in the amount of real data, it is suggested to be between 15 and 30 signals, a good working range for FaultD-XAI.</p>

Case 3 obtained the highest accuracy value with 15 signals, being 95.5% and standard deviation of 2.1%.

<p id="S5.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The differences in accuracy and standard deviation obtained between each case are in accordance with what was expected in the study. Case 1 is a bearings remaining useful life test, where data were collected continuously, without the bench being dismantled to insert the defects. As there were no changes in the test bench, variations in the dynamic behavior of the machine are not expected, other than those caused by the wear of the components (since it is isolated).

<div id="S5.SS3.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p9.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, in Case 2 and 3, the benches were dismantled to insert the faults. Therefore, small changes in relation to the real signal used as a reference for generating the synthetic data may occur during assembly and adjustment, generating a reduction in accuracy. This condition represents a situation where the system was trained with a machine signal in a similar condition, but not identical to the current one (which is a transfer learning problem definition).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p10.1" class="ltx_p">The two analyzes are extremely interesting, and show the applicability of the system in the industrial scenario. In Case 1, it addresses the monitoring of a machine, where the system was installed, trained, and over time was able to identify a fault in the asset. In Case 2 and 3, the model was initially installed and trained. Hypothetically, the machine underwent some corrective maintenance, and the same model, without being retrained, continued to monitor the asset, and was able to identify the faults present. The fact that there is no need to retrain the model for small changes in the asset or reestablish the operating condition through corrective maintenance, overcomes a major problem in applications that is retraining. It is worth mentioning that for major interventions or changes in projects that modify the dynamic behavior of the machine, the model will tend to reduce its accuracy if not retraining.</p>

On the other hand, the faulted signals (BPFO) were confused with the normal condition and looseness only. The confusion between normal and BPFO may still be acceptable, due to the run to failure test feature and manual label. Therefore, signals referring to the beginning of the fault may present similar characteristics. The other classifications were model errors. Analyzing the result only by class, the normal signals were classified correctly 97.67% of the time, and faulty signals (BPFO) 98.45%. The confusion matrix for Case 2 is shown in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.3 Number of real samples for training ‣ 5 Results and discussion ‣ Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI: a Transfer Learning-based Approach for Rotating Machinery exploiting Augmented Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

As the gear fault characteristics are different from the errors presented, it can be concluded that there is a model error, despite the low amount. Analyzing by class, normal signals were classified correctly 91.14% of the time, and faulty signals 92.67%. The confusion matrix for Case 3 is shown in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.3 Number of real samples for training ‣ 5 Results and discussion ‣ Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI: a Transfer Learning-based Approach for Rotating Machinery exploiting Augmented Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

The normal signals were confused with all types of faults, despite the low amount. The unbalance signals were confused with normal condition, BPFO and looseness. Misalignment was confused with normal condition, unbalance, looseness and gear fault. Finally, looseness was confused only with unbalance and misalignment. Among the classes, the normal condition was the one with the highest accuracy rate with 99.04%. The misalignment showed the highest error, resulting in 90.56%. The unbalance showed 98.97% and looseness 93.49%. The results show the greatest difficulty in classifying misalignment and looseness, which was expected, since some harmonics (such as: 2x and 3x) can be highlighted in both condition, making the analysis difficult.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a new generic and interpretable approach to classifying faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented synthetic data to real rotating machinery. The six-stage scheme is adopted: i) Data Acquisition; ii) Signal Generation; iii) Data Augmentation; iv) Signal Processing; v) Fault Diagnosis; vi) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). From the acquired vibration signals, the synthetic faults are generated and augmented. Subsequently, they are transformed to the frequency domain, and used to train the AI model. After training, the model is able to classify real fault signals, without them having been used in training. Finally, explainability allows analyzing the predictions obtained.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FaultD-XAI is the first work that combined synthetic data with data augmentation to avoid the need of real data by exploiting XAI and transfer learning for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The main contributions of FaultD-XAI are: i) a new transfer learning classification approach based on a synthetic dataset, without the need to have signals of real fault conditions; ii) possibility of interpreting the way in which the final result was obtained by the model, supporting decision making (a new contribution to the study of XAI in fault diagnosis); iii) a generic and simple way to generate synthetic fault data for training, based on the knowledge available in vibration analysis, without the need for complex models; iv) possibility of generating varied training datasets of different sizes (data augmentation - targeting deep learning applications); v) new dataset, publicly available, to study failures such as: unbalance, misalignment and looseness; vi) possibility of application in different types of faults; vii) faster deployment of the model in production; viii) industrial application on real world datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The results show that it is possible to train a model for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery, without having labeled data for all faults, overcoming this major problem in industrial applications. In addition, FaultD-XAI makes it possible to identify the most relevant features used by the model to perform the prediction, overcoming another major problem, which is to trust the result obtained by black-box models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the best results (accuracy and standard deviation) reached in Case 1, 2 and 3 were: 98.1% (1.2%), 92.5% (5.5%) and 95.5% (2.1%), respectively. Using the traditional supervised training method and real data, the results obtained were: 98.1% (0.53%), 98.9% (0.86%) and 99.8% (0.11%), for Case 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Therefore, comparing both results, it can be concluded that FaultD-XAI presents a promissory proposal for fault diagnosis. Moreover, the model’s explainability analysis shows that it was able to learn the most relevant characteristics of each condition, and that FaultD-XAI is capable of supporting the expert’s final decision-making.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As FaultD-XAI does not require labeled data of all possible machine operating conditions, and only knowledge currently available on fault diagnosis through vibration analysis, the methodology has many possible engineering applications. Future work will explore FaultD-XAI to remaining useful life estimation of rotating machinery components <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>, using synthetic data, transfer learning and XAI.</p>
