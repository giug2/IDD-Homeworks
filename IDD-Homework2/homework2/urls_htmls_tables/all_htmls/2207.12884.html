<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Future wireless networks are expected to support diverse mobile services, including artificial intelligence (AI) services and ubiquitous data transmissions. Federated learning (FL), as a revolutionary learning approach, enables collaborative AI model training across distributed mobile edge devices. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, over-the-air computation allows concurrent model uploading from massive devices over the same radio resources, and thus significantly reduces the communication cost of FL. In this paper, we study the <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">coexistence</em> of over-the-air FL and traditional information transfer (IT) in a mobile edge network, where an access point (AP) coordinates a set of devices for over-the-air FL and serves multiple devices for information transfer in the meantime. We propose a <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">coexisting federated learning and information transfer</em> (<em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">CFLIT</em>) communication framework, where the FL and IT devices share the wireless spectrum in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Under this framework, we aim to maximize the IT data rate and guarantee a given FL convergence performance by optimizing the long-term radio resource allocation. A key challenge that limits the spectrum efficiency of the coexisting system lies in the large overhead incurred by frequent communication between the server and edge devices for FL model aggregation. To address the challenge, we rigorously analyze the impact of the computation-to-communication ratio on the convergence of over-the-air FL in wireless fading channels. The analysis reveals the existence of an optimal computation-to-communication ratio that minimizes the amount of radio resources needed for over-the-air FL to converge to a given error tolerance. Based on the analysis, we propose a low-complexity online algorithm to jointly optimize the radio resource allocation for both the FL devices and IT devices. We further derive an analytical expression of the achievable data rate of IT users. Extensive numerical simulations verify the superior performance of the proposed design for the coexistence of FL and IT devices in wireless cellular systems.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of mobile artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving and intelligent personal assistants, triggers the emergence of a new paradigm called <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">edge intelligence</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which migrates the training and inference processes of AI models from central cloud servers to the edge of wireless networks, i.e., edge servers and mobile devices. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has been widely perceived as a promising edge learning framework that allows mobile devices to collaboratively train a shared AI model without disclosing the raw data. Specifically, mobile devices download the global model from an edge server for local model training and upload the updated local models to the edge server. The server then updates the global model by aggregating a linear combination of local models. To relieve the communication burden of FL model uploading and aggregation, over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> has been introduced into the FL model aggregation process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, over-the-air model aggregation allows massive devices to simultaneously transmit their local models using the same channel and coherently aligns the local models at the server. The required bandwidth and communication latency for over-the-air computation are independent of the number of devices, thus significantly reducing the communication cost for FL model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Extensive studies have been conducted to design over-the-air FL systems in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Most prior work, however, considers over-the-air computation over narrow-band systems and is not applicable to modern broadband wireless networks. To facilitate broadband implementation, the recent work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed a broadband over-the-air model aggregation approach in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Nonetheless, Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> ignored the coexistence of over-the-air FL with traditional information transfer (IT) services. Note that future wireless networks are required to support multiple devices with different data communication demands at the same time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. For instance, FL devices need to frequently communicate model information with an access point (AP), which in the meanwhile serves another set of devices for data streaming. Therefore, it is of great importance to design a coexisting system to support the coexistence of over-the-air FL and IT in wireless networks. This motivates the work in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Designing the above coexisting system is a challenging task. Although over-the-air model aggregation greatly reduces the bandwidth cost compared with traditional FL, uploading high-dimensional model parameters to the edge server iteratively until model convergence still leads to an extremely high bandwidth cost. Such a high bandwidth consumption leaves very little spectrum for IT devices to transmit their data traffic. Therefore, minimizing the bandwidth consumption of over-the-air FL is a critical problem in the design of the coexisting system. Note that the total bandwidth consumption is sensitive to the total number of communication rounds, which is critically determined by the design of the over-the-air FL training process. Consequently, we shall carefully study the FL mechanism design to minimize the bandwidth consumption needed for convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are two main research directions towards minimizing the bandwidth consumption of FL in the literature: one is to reduce the communication bandwidth cost per communication round and the other is to reduce the total number of communication rounds for model update. On one hand, the communication cost in each round can be reduced by model compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Existing approaches for model compression are divided into two categories: quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In the former, local models are quantized into finite-bit digits to reduce the amount of data in model uploading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In the latter, local gradients are transformed to low-dimensional vectors at the transmitters by exploiting the gradient sparsity and recovered at the server by compressed sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, the total number of communication rounds can be reduced by carefully selecting the computation-to-communication ratio. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> have reported that the number of model updates computed locally before uploading the local model parameters to the server for model aggregation critically determines the total number of communication rounds needed for convergence. Specifically, a smaller number of local updates (i.e., a lower computation-to-communication ratio) means more frequent model aggregation, and thus a higher communication cost. Meanwhile, a larger number of local updates (i.e., a higher computation-to-communication ratio) leads to infrequent model aggregation, which inevitably slows down the learning convergence especially when the data distribution across devices is heterogeneous. Inspired by this observation, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> optimized the number of local updates to minimize the required number of FL communication rounds. Moreover, Refs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> extended the result in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> by taking the wireless network characteristics into account.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although the current work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> has demonstrated the effectiveness of model compression on reducing the communication cost for over-the-air model aggregation, the number of model parameters after compression is still very large. For instance, the famous deep learning model AlexNet in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> consists of more than 60 million parameters. Even the state-of-the-art gradient sparsification approach has compressed the transmitted local gradients with compression ratio of <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">10</mn><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">10\%</annotation></semantics></math> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, transmitting the sparsified model to the server still consumes a large amount of radio resources in each round. In light of this, reducing the required number of model communication rounds is critical to save the bandwidth cost. The prior work on the optimization of computation-to-communication ratio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, however, considers conventional orthogonal transmission and is not applicable to over-the-air FL. For over-the-air FL, the wireless channel fading inevitably induces signal misalignment in model aggregation, which brings a considerable error in the aggregated global gradient. Such an error is coupled with the effect of local model updating during the training process and slows down the learning convergence rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the coupled impact of the model aggregation error and the number of local updates on the bandwidth consumption needed for the convergence of over-the-air FL. Nonetheless, this important study is largely overlooked in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study a <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">coexisting federated learning and information transfer</em> (<em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">CFLIT</em>) system in a single-cell mobile edge network consisting of a single AP, a set of FL devices, and a set of IT devices. The AP coordinates the FL devices for over-the-air FL and simultaneously serves the IT devices for uplink IT using the same uplink spectrum. To minimize the bandwidth cost for FL, we first analyze the convergence behavior of over-the-air FL as a function of local model updates and the total number of communication rounds in a wireless fading channel. Based on the analysis, we optimize the key parameters, i.e., the number of local updates and the number of FL communication rounds, to minimize the radio resources needed for over-the-air model aggregation. Then, we formulate a radio resource allocation problem to simultaneously maximize the average IT data rate and guarantee the convergence of over-the-air FL in a given time horizon. The lack of non-causal information of future channel state makes it difficult to jointly optimize the long-term radio resource allocation for both the FL and IT devices with an offline scheme. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a low-complexity online algorithm to make real-time allocation decisions based on the current observation of channel state information (CSI). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the joint communication and learning design in a wireless network to support the coexistence of over-the-air FL and IT.

On one hand, the data stream of each IT device is first segmented into parallel streams, which are then modulated into digital signals on the allocated subcarriers before being transmitted to the AP. On the other hand, to leverage over-the-air computation for model aggregation, the local model symbols of FL devices are modulated into analog signals. We employ analog amplitude modulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> for the modulation, where each symbol is converted to a uniform waveform, e.g., a square wave, with amplitude proportional to the value of the original symbol. Due to the superposition nature of multiple-access channels, the received signal is approximately a square wave with amplitude proportional to the weighted sum of local symbols. Therefore, model aggregation can be efficiently achieved by transmitter-side pre-equalization. The receiver of the AP performs digital demodulation on the subcarriers allocated to IT and analog amplitude demodulation on the other subcarriers. As a result, the AP is able to extract data streams and over-the-air aggregated model symbols from the subcarriers accordingly.</p>

However, we emphasize that FL and IT have different sensitivities against communication errors. The gradient descent step in FL is naturally robust against a small gradient error as slightly perturbing the descent direction does not affect the convergence to the local minimum; see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, Fig. 5]</cite>. To better utilize the radio resources to support the coexistence of FL and IT, we exploit the different error sensitivities of FL and IT and allocate the subcarriers to IT if the IT devices have good channel conditions. The remaining radio resources are then utilized for FL model aggregation.

Although a higher SNR leads to a larger IT data rate, its impact on FL performance is not consistently monotonic. For example, when the SNR decreases from 30 dB to 10 dB, the training performance is not affected because the model aggregation error is small enough to preserve convergence. However, when the SNR falls below 10 dB, the substantial communication errors cause significant perturbations to the gradient directions, resulting in a larger training loss.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel CFLIT framework to support the coexistence of over-the-air FL and uplink information transfer. To maximize the average IT data rate while ensuring the convergence of over-the-air FL, we studied the joint optimization of the OFDM subcarrier allocation, the transceiver design, and the FL hyper-parameters. We analyzed the convergence of over-the-air FL to minimize the bandwidth consumption needed for FL convergence guarantee. Based on the analysis, we optimized the transceiver design, the number of local updates, and the number of FL communication rounds. Moreover, we proposed a low-complexity online algorithm to optimize the CFLIT subcarrier allocation under the time-varying channels and derived a closed-form expression of its achievable IT data rate. Extensive simulations verify our analysis and demonstrate the performance improvement, in both the FL convergence and the average IT data rate, of the proposed design compared with the baselines.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we conclude the paper with some interesting future directions. First, we assumed perfect synchronization of the local model updates transmitted from FL devices for over-the-air model aggregation, which is difficult to achieve in practice. The lack of synchronization will result in not only signal misalignment but also inter-symbol interference. Therefore, new designs on pre-equalization and de-noising are needed to address the synchronization issue in the coexisting system. Second, we showed numerically in Section V-D that combining our design with separate model compression can reduce the communication cost of FL. Joint optimization of the model aggregation frequency and model compression/quantization under a unified framework would further improve the communication efficiency in over-the-air FL. Moreover, device selection and scheduling are also key designing factors that significantly affect the FL convergence. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand their impacts on the performance of the coexisting system.</p>
