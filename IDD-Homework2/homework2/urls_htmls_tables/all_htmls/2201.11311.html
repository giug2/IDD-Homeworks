<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The adoption of machine learning (ML) is expected to enable the flourishing development of many applications, such as autonomous driving, intelligent applications, or load balancing. Although machine learning has significantly improved the performance of many applications, most machine learning models must be built in central servers, which may violate privacy, especially for users with sensitive data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This is because to participate in learning a model, users/devices trade their privacy by sending their sensitive data to the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To overcome this problem, Google proposed Federated Learning (FL) to locally train models on edge devices while keeping their data private <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Federated learning works as a collaborative learning process in which edge devices run training models locally and then send model updates, <math id="S1.p1.1.m1.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="i.e." display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.3a"><mrow id="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1"><mrow id="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">i</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0.167em" id="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1a.cmml">.</mo><mi id="S1.p1.1.m1.2.2" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.2.2.cmml">e</mi></mrow><mo lspace="0em" id="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.2">.</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.3b"><apply id="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1a.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.1">formulae-sequence</csymbol><ci id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑖</ci><ci id="S1.p1.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.2.2">𝑒</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.3c">i.e.</annotation></semantics></math>, the weight and gradient parameters of the training model, to the central server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL has improved privacy protection, it still suffers from several problems. First, all devices involved in the FL process are expected to contribute their resources unconditionally, which is not accepted by all workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Without reward, only a small fraction of the devices are willing to participate in the training process. On the other hand, the devices involved in the training are unreliable and may act maliciously, intentionally, or unintentionally, which may affect the overall model and lead to erroneous model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For intentional behaviors, the device may send an incorrect update that influences the overall model and leads to failure. In addition, communication is a critical bottleneck in FL networks, which can lead to some unintended device behaviors. Due to the high communication turns between devices and the central server, devices may unintentionally update some poor parameters that negatively influence federated learning tasks. Therefore, it is important to develop a new FL architecture to alleviate transmission loads and to improve the reliability of model updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the aforementioned challenges, several researchers proposed combining FL and blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed solution that ensures trust between unreliable entities without depending on a third party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. With its features of anonymity, reliability, security, and no single point of failure, blockchain has the potential to improve FL. The authors of the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a FL and blockchain architecture, in which devices involved in learning send their model updates to the blockchain for validation. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed using the blockchain with FL to establish a secure reputation for devices participating in learning. While this work presented the potential of using blockchain with FL to improve device reputation and trustworthiness, it introduced third-party devices, namely blockchain miners, to mine blocks in a distributed manner. This will lead to model leakage, as the model parameters will be shared with these miners. In addition, blockchain still suffers from several shortcomings, including the scalability problem, which can affect its integration with FL. For example, the scalability problem of the blockchain may further increase the communication delay for the FL.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we present in this paper the SRB-FL framework. SRB-FL provides secure, reliable, trustworthy, and transparent framework suitable for FL. This framework implements: (1) blockchain sharding to enable parallel model training to improve the scalability of blockchain FL; and (2) an incentive mechanism to improve the reliability of FL devices. We consider synchronous FL case where devices participating in the learning belong to the same blockchain shard, that is to enable all devices to follow the same time line.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning was introduced by Google to distribute data learning, enabling FL devices to learn locally without sharing their sensitive data. Keeping data locally yields many benefits, namely immediate access to ephemeral data, privacy preservation and leveraging the computing resources of the sparse participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, FL still suffers from several shortcomings such as device’s reliability and security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To overcome some of these problems, research has introduced blockchain-based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed DeepChain, a secure and reliable FL framework that improves the reliability of FL devices using blockchain smart contracts. This framework implemented an incentive mechanism to incite FL devices to behave honestly. However, a comprehensive study with real-time data is needed to scale up the DeepChain approach. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a trustworthy blockchain and FL solution to ensure reliable shard training on the fog. Although useful, their solution has high a throughput.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a blockchain-based on-device FL architecture, in which local and global updates of FL devices are stored on the blockchain. They also studied the scalability, robustness, and latency of integrating blockchain with FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the authors presented a FL and blockchain model that improves the security. In this model, the FL devices upload only the final updates on the chain, whereas the local updates are sent to a distributed hash table. Although this model reduces block generation latency, it is subject to security and integrity issues. Indeed, the authors proposed to reduce the consensus difficulty of the blockchain in order to reduce the latency, which can consequently lead to false data injection attacks or 51% majority attacks.</p>

This solution used a consortium blockchain approach to improve the device reputation. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a hybrid blockchain architecture for a secure and reliable federated learning. This architecture proposed integrating learned models into the blockchain to improve the reliability of data. Although the combination of Blockchain with FL improved to be very useful, however, to the best our knowledge, none of the existing works have taken into considered the inherent problems of blockchain, such as the scalability problem. Indeed, blockchain suffers from issues related to the block generation which impact the scalability of blockchain.</p>

SRB-FL provides a secure and reliable blockchain framework that allows FL devices to train and send model updates in a secure, reliable, and trustworthy manner. The SRB-FL framework proposes the use of multiple shard chains, each of which is responsible for training a FL model, and the main chain is responsible for tracing all final model updates.

Once these devices have completed their training using their local data, they send their final model updates to the main chain.

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the sharding layer, FL devices act as blockchain miners because they have sufficient computing power. The sharding layer consists of the main chain and the sub-chains. The main chain stores final model updates, while the sub-chains store local model updates. The sub-chains act as a group of clusters, each sub-chain contains a group of FL devices. The details of device selection for each sub-chain are not the focus of this paper. However, we can adopt some of the well-known methods, such as: feature selection, random selection or reputation-based selection.</p>

It is worth mentioning that only the final updates that correspond to the highest accuracy are added into the main chain. To add a block into the chain, a FL device acts as miners where they need to reach a consensus. Once the consensus is reached among the shard, the final model updates are then stored permanently into the chain. In our framework, we propose using on-chain and off-chain storage, that is, metadata corresponding to the updates are stored on the chain, and the raw data are stored off the chain. This is because the blockchain has limited bloc size. Finally, the updates are sent to the corresponding model publisher.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Fig 3(d) compares the latency of variant blockchains-FL. As shown by the figure, the basic blockchain-FL uses PoW consensus, which increased latency when increasing the number of blocks. Meanwhile, the time needed to add a block to the blockchain is a fixed value 0.1s for the SRB-FL. The results demonstrate the efficiency of SRB-FL, in terms of scalability, accuracy, reputation, and latency in comparison with a basic blockchain-FL framework.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed SRB-FL, a secure and reliable blockchain framework suitable for federated learning. To overcome the issues of unreliable and malicious FL devices involved in the training of FL that may affect the overall model accuracy and lead to falsified model updates, we proposed a secure and reliable blockchain framework. We employed blockchain sharding to improve blockchain efficiency and enable parallel model training. We then designed a reputation mechanism that uses a multi-weight subjective logic to improve the reliability FL devices. Furthermore, we designed an intra-reputation and inter-reputation process to simulate the reputation of FL devices that have trustworthy and reliable updates to participate on the learning process. The simulation results showed that SRB-FL framework can greatly improve the reliability of FL devices while ensure reliable federated learning making it a promising solution to improve the reliability and security of federated learning.</p>
