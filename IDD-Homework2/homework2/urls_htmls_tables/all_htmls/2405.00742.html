<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Mitigating cybersecurity risk in electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting plays a crucial role in the safe operation of collective EV chargings, the stability of the power grid, and the cost-effective infrastructure expansion. However, existing methods either suffer from the data privacy issue and the susceptibility to cyberattacks or fail to consider the spatial correlation among different stations. To address these challenges, a federated graph learning approach involving multiple charging stations is proposed to collaboratively train a more generalized deep learning model for demand forecasting while capturing spatial correlations among various stations and enhancing robustness against potential attacks. Firstly, for better model performance, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is leveraged to characterize the geographic correlation among different charging stations in a federated manner. Secondly, to ensure robustness and deal with the data heterogeneity in a federated setting, a message passing that utilizes a global attention mechanism to aggregate personalized models for each client is proposed. Thirdly, by concerning cyberattacks, a special credit-based function is designed to mitigate potential threats from malicious clients or unwanted attacks. Extensive experiments on a public EV charging dataset are conducted using various deep learning techniques and federated learning methods to demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by both individuals and businesses has raised concerns about the potential strain on the grid and charging infrastructure.
Accurate demand forecasts are essential for sustainable operations of the electric vehicle - charging station - power grid ecosystem, which, in turn, facilitates the electrification and decarbonization of the transportation sector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
There has been extensive research conducted on EV charging demand forecasting by collecting a large number of EV charging information to train a deep learning model for better prediction performance in a centralized way <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, training a deep model usually acquires IoT devices over a communication system embedded within an EV charging station for information exchange, which is susceptible to cyberattacks such as False Data Injection (FDI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Adversary robust methods or anomaly detection methods should be investigated against these cyberattacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, data collected from different stations have privacy concerns which may reveal consumers’ privacy, e.g., traveling routes, home and office addresses, payment information, individual preferences, etc., opening doors for exploiting the EV charging infrastructure through various vulnerable components in the cyber-layer if they are sent to a central server.
Therefore, concerning privacy and cyberattack issues, it is essential to find a safe and privacy-preserving way to train the charging demand forecasting model that can leverage the charging data in different stations without violating data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is widely acknowledged that Federated learning (FL) can harness the information among different clients by sharing the model rather than the data, which provides a secure and private way for different stations/operators to collaboratively train EV charging demand forecasting models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
FL can also protect privacy against several types of cyberattacks at the data level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, including denial of service (DoS), structured query language (SQL), and man-in-the-middle. However, it still faces the risk of malicious attacks on the local models when transmitting to the server. In such a case, the commonly used “averaging” becomes susceptible to arbitrary manipulation even if just one local model is compromised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Typical Byzantine robust methods classify the malicious by clustering, or geometric median, which is effective in malicious attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, these methods train a shared model for all the clients, which can degrade the performance of some or all participants because the data in different stations are not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d). Therefore, proposing the personalized federated learning framework is of great importance to EV charging stations, considering their heterogeneous data distribution. Many personalized techniques have been proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue, including local tuning, model interpolation, clustering, and multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
However, most personalized methods incorporate “averaging” aggregation in the server, which is quite vulnerable to threat models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the EV demand forecasting area, few papers have adopted the federated learning technique to improve their forecasting performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, vanilla FedAvg is first applied to the energy demand forecasting for EV network, while federated cluster learning is further proposed to improve the training efficiency and personalized performance. Although clustering helps to improve personalized performance, the inter-cluster feature is not learned with the framework, which deteriorates the generalized performance of the global model in each cluster.
Similarly, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a blockchain-based hierarchical federated learning is proposed for EV charging demand forecasting, while the clustering method is used to get a personalized model for each cluster. Nevertheless, the cybersecurity and the correlated relationship between and inside the clusters are not considered. To protect data privacy against different kinds of cyberattacks for EV energy demanding forecasting, a secure FL is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, where a double authentication process is designed to avoid the attacked model from the client or server. Despite being effective against the cyberattack, the global model is aggregated by ”averaging”, which fails to generate personalized models for each client.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, unlike traditional fuel stations that typically adhere to uniform consumption patterns and demand trends, EV charging stations can exhibit substantial variations influenced by factors such as geographic location, infrastructure availability, charging speed, and user preferences. Given the multifaceted nature of these factors impacting the behavior of EV charging stations, it becomes increasingly imperative to consider not only the temporal aspects within an individual station but also the broader context of data interconnection and interoperability, as elucidated in references <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
In terms of capturing spatial information, Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a promising paradigm that has been applied to capture deep patterns and handle dependencies among time series across different problems in different fields, including traffic forecasting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, situation recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
Currently, few GNN-based methods have been applied to the EV charging demand forecasting.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> integrates different EV charging station data to improve the generalization using temporal GNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal features into the forecasting process.
Recent research has generally revealed that many machine learning models suffer from security vulnerabilities; the same applies to GNNs.
Therefore, it is critical to design an intrinsically secure message-passing mechanism for graph-structured data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, AirGNN denoises the hidden features in neural network layers caused by the adversarial perturbation using the graph structural information.
More importantly, robustness is another concern for federated learning, where malicious attacks could happen during the transmission or aggregation process.
A federated spatio-temporal model CNFGNN is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, which can effectively model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, CNFGNN does not take into account malicious attacks and the robustness of the algorithm, leaving room for further exploration in this critical aspect of model security to ensure that the model can maintain the robustness under attack while protecting the privacy and security of user data.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the challenges of data privacy, cybersecurity, and the correlations among stations, this paper proposes a robust federated graph learning method with personalization.
The core idea is to leverage the correlated information among limited stations/operators while avoiding malicious attacks and alleviating the influence brought by data heterogeneity. Specifically, operators with similar data distribution are encouraged to collaborate more, while the Byzantine robustness for each operator is guaranteed based on an attention-inducing mechanism.

Such a method can get an effective personalized model, while the global model is obtained using ”averaging” aggregation, which is vulnerable to malicious attacks. Once one of the clients sends the false model information to the server, the aggregated global model will be poisoned, and thus lead to a worse performance of the local model. Therefore, to improve the robustness of the global model to work against malicious model attacks, a new aggregation rule is required, and (<a href="#S2.E5" title="In II-B New FL for Charging Demand Forecasting ‣ II Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) can be rewritten as:</p>

Spatial-temporal graph convolution networks are used to capture spatial and temporal dependencies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which consist of a spatial-temporal convolution module and a temporal convolution module, as described in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III Proposed Personalized Federated Graph Learning Method ‣ Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a). The former aggregates spatial information from the neighborhood, while the latter uses convolution neural networks along the temporal dimension.
In this paper, multiple spatial-temporal graph convolution networks are stacked to extract dynamic spatial-temporal correlations. We now introduce the spatial-temporal attention mechanism and spatial-temporal graph convolution in the GNN layer.</p>

It consists of 8 EV charging stations. For the data pre-processing, the EV charging transaction is recorded as events, which includes the electricity charging demand (kWh) and the charging start time and end time. Hence, considering the time-varying and periodicity of EV charging events, each day is divided into 48 periods. The original charging session records are then discretized into 25,9415 pieces of data, aggregated over 30-minute intervals for each specific station. Hence, each station has 34,993 data entries.</p>

The “improved rate” represents the percentage of nodes whose results are better than those of the No_FL.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In steps 1 and 6, the forecasting results of QS loss show that PFGL outperforms other baselines in 5/8 and 6/8 stations respectively, with the average QS loss value being the best. For MIL, PFGL surpasses baselines for 6/8 stations in steps 6 forecasting results, with the mean MIL values also indicating superior performance. In the case of ICP, PFGL outperforms other baselines for step 1 forecasting results in 5/8 stations, with the mean ICP values of steps 1 and 6 indicating superior performance. These results illustrate the improvement offered by our proposed model, particularly evident in the long-term forecasting accuracy of QS loss. This highlights the effectiveness of employing a personal federated aggregation approach to improve prediction accuracy. For demonstration,
the 6-step ahead prediction results of the PFGL for different
stations are drawn, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-C Performance without Malicious Attacks ‣ IV Case Studies ‣ Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Furthermore, the comparison between baseline LSTM-FedAvg and LSTM-CNN-FedAvg (LSTM-PFL with LSTM-CNN-PFL) reveals a decrease in QS loss, indicating that the convolution operation efficiently enhances forecasting accuracy. This also suggests that when information is aggregated after passing through a CNN or GNN, it is more effective than direct aggregation. Additionally, most of the results of LSTM-PFL outperform LSTM-FedAvg, highlighting the efficiency of the PFL framework. When comparing PFGL to CFNGNN, two federated learning frameworks based on graph neural networks, PFGL achieves mostly superior outcomes. This outcome highlights PFGL’s ability to model the temporal trajectory of multivariate time series. Furthermore, it demonstrates PFGL’s capacity to capture spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed PFL, each client will be given a personalized aggregated model by attributing different weights to the clients’ model, where the weights are calculated based on the similarity between the target client and other clients. In such a manner, clients with parameters that differ much from the target client will be attributed to less weight when performing aggregation. Naturally, when a malicious participant sends an arbitrary local model, the local model will be attributed to small or even near zero weight when it is used to aggregate the global model of another client. To testify the proposed method under false data injection attack, one of the clients is selected to send manipulated models, while three kinds of manipulating methods including parameter flipping, scaling, and Gaussian noise are carried out to generate the threat model, as indicated in (<a href="#S4.E19" title="In IV-D Performance under Malicious Attacks ‣ IV Case Studies ‣ Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">19</span></a>);</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since the goal of the task is to forecast the demand for EV, we use the average QS loss as the metric to evaluate its effectiveness of the proposed model to counteract malicious clients.
The attack results of the baselines and the proposed PFGL are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-D Performance under Malicious Attacks ‣ IV Case Studies ‣ Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. It is seen that the average quantile loss for 8 stations under three kinds of attack increased drastically when it is trained using averaging aggregation (LSTM-FedAvg case), indicating that LSTM-FedAvg cannot bear attacks from even a single client. The proposed PFGL, however, can work against three kinds of attacks and still get a lower quantile loss than that of the solely local training method. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed PFL, the proportion of malicious clients is increased, specifically for 1/8 to 8/8.
When the portion of the malicious increases, the average QS of baseline increases sharply, whereas that of the proposed PFL remains quite stable, with a quantile loss less than that of the Non-federated method. It is natural that the proposed PFL can achieve such a robust result since the normal client will attribute very small weight to the model of the malicious client based on the designed aggregation rule.
Moreover, compared to the baseline, it appears that frameworks utilizing information aggregation through CNN or GNN, along with PFL, perform better than the FedAvg framework under false data injection attacks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the framework, we utilized 1D CNN encoders to extract
temporal information and features and then upload them to a
server. By employing CNNs, we no longer upload raw data but
high-dimensional features, thus protecting data privacy. Addition-
ally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs, we conducted a comparison with LSTM encoders as feature extractors for 6-
step demand prediction. We employed a 2-layer LSTM as the
LSTM encoder (see Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-F Influence of the CNN ‣ IV Case Studies ‣ Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>). It can be observed that using
CNN encoders yielded superior results in both MIL and ICP
compared to LSTM encoders, and CNN encoders are simpler
than LSTM encoders. Thus, this validates the effectiveness of
CNN encoders.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a novel personalized federated graph learning framework is proposed for multi-horizon EV charging demand forecasting, where both the data privacy and security of different stations are guaranteed. To realize probabilistic forecasting while leveraging the correlation between stations, it is first constructed into a graph neural network, where each station trains a probabilistic forecasting model with quantile regression. Further, the GNN structure is integrated into the federated setting with a central server, in which the model of each station is transmitted to protect data privacy. Moreover, a message-passing aggregation method based on the model similarity among stations is provided in the server to get knowledge from the other stations. Meanwhile, a credit-based method is proposed where the similarity can be tuned adaptively with the guiding of the credit that one station has put on the rest of the participants. The convergence of the proposed federated graph learning framework is provided. Experiment on the public EV charging dataset is used to testify to the effectiveness, while the results demonstrate that the proposed method cannot only improve the test performance but also provide a personalized and robust model for each station against malicious attacks. In the future, we will consider the scalability as well as the methods of accelerate the algorithm of PFGL.</p>
