<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) aims to foster collaboration among a population of clients to improve the accuracy of machine learning without directly sharing local data. Although there has been rich literature on designing federated learning algorithms, most prior works implicitly assume that all clients are willing to participate in a FL scheme.
In practice, clients may not benefit from joining in FL, especially in light of potential costs related to issues such as privacy and computation.
In this work, we study the clients’ incentives in federated learning to help the service provider design better solutions and ensure clients make better decisions. We are the first to model clients’ behaviors in FL as a network effects game, where each client’s benefit depends on other clients who also join the network. Using this setup we analyze the dynamics of clients’ participation and characterize the equilibrium, where no client has incentives to alter their decision. Specifically, we show that dynamics in the population naturally converge to equilibrium without needing explicit interventions. Finally, we provide a cost-efficient payment scheme that incentivizes clients to reach a desired equilibrium when the initial network is empty.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables a network of clients (<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g., </span>mobile devices, hospitals) to jointly learn a model without sharing their private local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Kairouz et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In real-world applications, the performance of the model on a particular client may not be improved through federation due to heterogeneity in the data generated by federated networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Moreover, even if a particular client has improved model utility on their local data by joining FL training, they may suffer from costs induced by joining the federated network. For example, the communication or latency in FL may affect the quality of clients’ user experience and the clients may suffer some privacy costs for sharing sensitive information.
Understanding client incentives in FL is crucial for the service provider to design better solutions and for each client to make better decisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There is growing literature on incentive mechanisms in federated learning. Most of these works aim to study how to combine the data from all the clients to achieve a low error rate and ensure fairness for participating clients. However, these works are often based on a common assumption that all clients are willing participants who will join the federated network in order to achieve different learning goals (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g., </span>minimize the sample complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Blum et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, learn coalition structures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Donahue and Kleinberg, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021c</a>)</cite>, <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc.</span>) In practice, rational clients can decide to either opt-in or opt-out of federated training based on their utility gain and cost as the network grows over time. The formal study of such a dynamic has not been captured in prior works studying incentives in federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Understanding how incentives change in response to varying client participation is essential for the successful development of incentive mechanisms in federated learning.
In this work, we propose to model the clients’ behaviors in FL through the lens of network effects games <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Katz and Shapiro, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">1985</a>; Shapiro and Varian, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>. A network effects game models the benefit of each individual after aligning their behavior with the behaviors of other people in a coalition. This participation game closely relates to the client’s behavior in FL where joining the federated training improves the utility compared to only training a model on local data. Traditionally, network effects games have not been looked at in the context of FL or more broadly, data sharing. Existing work in FL typically models client participation as a one-time game where the clients arrive and make decisions once before leaving. We instead focus on modeling the dynamic of client participation in a setting where (1) each client incurs a cost while joining the network, and (2) each client is willing to join the network <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">if and only if</span> their utility gain outweighs the cost.
The goal of our network effects analysis is to find an equilibrium where no client has an incentive to alter their decision.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on such a formulation, we consider two settings: (1) a simple and stylized mean estimation problem (<a href="#S4" title="4 Network Effects game in a Mean Estimation Problem ‣ Federated Learning as a Network Effects Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) and (2) a general setting that requires an oracle reporting the true utility of being in a coalition to all clients (<a href="#S5" title="5 Network Effects in FL with Utility Oracle ‣ Federated Learning as a Network Effects Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). For each setting, we fully characterize the dynamics of the client participation game under the network effects model.
A key feature of FL is that clients’ utility of joining depends on the number of participants/data points. Since different clients may have different utilities and costs, it may be easier to gradually incentivize participation over time. For example, we may first target the clients who have lower costs and are more willing to join, and their participation will increase other participants’ willingness to join, and so on. Based on this characterization, we design a cost-effective payment scheme that gradually targets a subset of clients over time to reach a desirable equilibrium in <a href="#S6" title="6 Network Effects in FL with Payment ‣ Federated Learning as a Network Effects Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Section</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.

where the utility of a client using a service depends on the number of other clients participating in the same service. This effect is often positive, as clients gain more utility from others joining the network. In our model, we consider accuracy improvement from having more data in a coalition as a natural incentive mechanism: As clients join the FL process, they expect to obtain a more accurate estimator from the combined data of all clients in the coalition. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to model network effects in FL in this manner, and our work is the first to study the behavior of rational clients in FL under the network effects model. In formulating and analyzing this dynamic perspective on client incentives, we hope that our work can lead to future study and development of FL incentive mechanisms that more closely mirror practical FL applications.</p>

As a result, some new clients now have positive expected utility gains and are willing to join the coalition. On the other hand, if there are fewer samples in the coalition than expected, the expected utility gain would decrease. Some clients who were previously in the coalition would leave as their utility gain is lower than their cost, while other clients have no incentives to join. We aim to study the dynamic of the population and characterize a suitable equilibrium under these behaviors.</p>

With this definition, we can analyze the dynamics of the population. Informally, if the initial expectation is not a stable equilibrium, then the clients can continually update their shared expectations and decide to either join or leave the coalition. This decision-making process ends when the shared expectation is at a stable equilibrium, where with a small perturbation to the coalition, there is no incentive for any client to change their decision.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous analysis, we rely on the assumption that all clients are trying to solve a common global mean estimation problem to derive the exact utility gain function. The clients then make their opt-in/opt-out decisions based on this expected utility gain value. How would the clients’ behavior change if the server and the clients do not know how to calculate the utility gain, but instead observe it from some oracle for some general learning problem? In this section, we will study this question assuming the underlying utility gain function is monotonically non-decreasing with regard to the total number of samples in the coalition. Since the utility gain function <a href="#S4.E1" title="In Mean Estimation Problem Setup. ‣ 4 Network Effects game in a Mean Estimation Problem ‣ Federated Learning as a Network Effects Game" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Equation</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> in the homogeneous setting satisfies our monotonicity assumption and we are considering a more general learning problem, the utility oracle setting is strictly more general than the mean estimation setting. First, we formalize our definition of self-fulfilling expectation equilibrium with utility oracle. Then, we show that the dynamic will always converge to a self-fulfilling expectation equilibrium with proof by induction.</p>

Since the size of the coalition does not decrease at each time step, this effect would cascade until the coalition has reached an equilibrium, where the extra utility from having more clients is not sufficient for new clients to join the coalition. On the other hand, if the initial coalition contains some clients with very high costs who would leave in the first few time steps, then all clients would observe a decreased utility gain in future time steps. Hence, clients who have not already joined the coalition would no longer want to participate in the federated learning process. Moreover, clients who joined in previous time steps might leave once their decreased utility from a smaller coalition becomes lower than their personal cost. Therefore, the total number of samples in the coalition would shrink until we have reached a self-fulfilling expectation equilibrium.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This result highlights the dynamic behavior of the population under the network effects model where clients are behaving in a myopic way with limited information. Under a mild assumption of monotonically increasing utility w.r.t the number of samples in the coalition and with any non-empty initial coalition, the dynamic always converges to a self-fulfilling expectation equilibrium. The monotonicity assumption is often justifiable—since all local samples are drawn i.i.d, having more samples in the coalition would intuitively produce a model with better accuracy in the mean estimation task. While the assumption of utility oracle is often not realistic, its inclusion removes the need for a closed-form expression for the utility gain function, which was previously needed in our analysis. As a result, our analysis here can also be applied to other learning problems that are not mean estimation as long as the utility gain for each client satisfies the monotonicity assumption.

Due to the stability property of some equilibria in the dynamic, the server would approach these two optimization problems with unlimited and limited budgets with the same strategy. In intuition, the optimal strategy involves paying a specific subset of clients at each time step to move the dynamic to a higher self-fulfilling expectation equilibrium. Since the number of paid clients is fixed at each time step, the server’s payment strategy is the same for both scenarios. From this point, we focus our analysis on the unlimited budget setting.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.4" class="ltx_p">We can generalize the payment structure above in the more general utility oracle setting when the initial coalition is empty. Similar to the mean estimation setting, at each time step, the server needs to rely on the stability property of self-fulfilling expectation equilibrium to reduce their total payment amount. That is, at each time step, the server wants to incentivize enough new clients to move the dynamic towards a higher self-fulfilling expectation equilibrium.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have initiated the study of clients’ behaviors in FL under a network effects game model, where each client’s participation decision changes as the network grows over time. We showed that whenever the entire population shares an expectation on the coalition size, we can characterize the dynamics of the client’s participation game for the mean estimation problem and a more general setting with a utility oracle. We identified self-fulfilling expectation equilibrium points, where the coalition after all clients have computed the best-response strategy matches the shared expectation. Moreover, we showed that without explicit intervention from the server, the client’s participation dynamic naturally converges to self-fulfilling expectation equilibria. Based on this characterization, we proposed a cost-efficient payment scheme that incentivizes clients so that the final coalition reaches a desirable equilibrium.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our framework offers insights into clients’ participation dynamics in FL. A limitation of our work is that we did not consider more realistic learning problems, and also assumed assumed that all clients are trying to solve a global problem instead of a personalized approach. Despite these limitations, we believe that our work provides a meaningful contribution to the study of incentives in FL, and hope that continuing to understand client participation dynamics can lead to the design of explicit incentive mechanisms that induce desirable final outcomes in practical FL applications.</p>

<p id="A2.SS1.SSS0.Px5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the previous analysis, we observe that a slight perturbation to the actual outcome at the tipping point (unstable equilibrium) will lead the expectation to move toward either a higher or lower equilibrium. If the coalition settles at a new equilibrium that is also a tipping point, then additional perturbations to the actual outcome will move the expectation to another equilibrium. This behavior only stops when the shared expectation reaches a stable equilibrium.</p>
