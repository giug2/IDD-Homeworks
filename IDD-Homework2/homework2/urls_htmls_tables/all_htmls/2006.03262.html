<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Traditional deep learning models are trained at a centralized server using labeled data samples collected from end devices or users. Such data samples often include private information, which the users may not be willing to share. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach to train such learning models without requiring the users to share their possibly private labeled data. FL consists of an iterative procedure, where in each iteration the users train a copy of the learning model locally. The server then collects the individual updates and aggregates them into a global model. A major challenge that arises in this method is the need of each user to repeatedly transmit its learned model over the throughput limited uplink channel. In this work, we tackle this challenge using tools from quantization theory. In particular, we identify the unique characteristics associated with conveying trained models over rate-constrained channels, and propose a suitable quantization scheme for such settings, referred to as universal vector quantization for FL (UVeQFed). We show that combining universal vector quantization methods with FL yields a decentralized training system in which the compression of the trained models induces only a minimum distortion. We then theoretically analyze the distortion, showing that it vanishes as the number of users grows. We also characterize how models trained with the conventional federated averaging method combined with UVeQFed converge to the model which minimizes the loss function. Our numerical results demonstrate the gains of UVeQFed over previously proposed methods in terms of both distortion induced in quantization and accuracy of the resulting aggregated model. In particular, we show that UVeQFed allows converging to a more accurate model when trained using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets compared to existing schemes.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning methods have demonstrated unprecedented performance in a broad range of applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This is achieved by training a deep network model based on a large number of labeled training samples. Often, these samples are gathered on end devices or users, such as smartphones, while the deep model is maintained by a computationally powerful centralized server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Traditionally, the users send their labeled data to the server, who in turn uses the massive amount of samples to train the model. However, data often contains private information, which the users may prefer not to share, and having each user transmit large volumes of training data to the server may induce a substantial load on the communication link. This gives rise to the need to adapt the network on the end-devices., i.e., train a centralized model in a distributed fashion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
 <span title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_long">Federated learning</span></span> (<abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr>) proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, is a method to update such decentralized models. Instead of requiring the users to share their possibly private labeled data, each user trains the network locally, and conveys its trained model updates to the server. The server then iteratively aggregates these updates into a global network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, commonly using some weighted average, also known as <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">federated averaging</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the major challenges of <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> is the transfer of a large number of updated model parameters over the uplink communication channel from the users to the server, whose throughput is typically constrained <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
This challenge can be tackled by reducing the number of participating users, via, e.g., scheduling policies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. An alternative strategy is to reduce the volume of data each user conveys, via sparsification or scalar quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed various methods for compressing the updates sent from the users to the server. These methods include random masks, subsampling, and probabilistic quantization.
Sparsifying masks for compressing the gradients were proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Additional forms of probabilistic scalar quantization for <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> were considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
However, these approaches are suboptimal from a quantization theory perspective, as, e.g., discarding a random subset of the gradients can result in dominant distortion, while scalar quantization is inferior to vector quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, Ch. 23]</cite>. This motivates the design and analysis of quantization methods for facilitating updated model transfer in <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr>, which minimize the error induced by quantization in the aggregated global model.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we design quantizers for distributed training by tackling the uplink compression in <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> problem from a quantization theory perspective. <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text">We first discuss the requirements which one have to account for, and can possibly exploit, when designing quantization schemes for <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr>. We specifically identify that such quantization schemes are required to operate without knowing the distribution of the model updates, as such knowledge is unlikely to be available in <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr>. We also note that the repeated communications between the server and users imply that they can share a source of local randomness, by, e.g., sharing a random seed, which can be utilized by the quantization mechanism.
<span id="S1.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
Based on these properties, we propose a scheme following concepts from universal quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, referred to as  <span title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_long">unviersal vector quantization for federated learning</span></span> (<abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr>). <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr> implements <span id="S1.p3.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">subtractive dithered lattice quantization</span>, which is based on solid information theoretic arguments. <span id="S1.p3.1.1.1.2" class="ltx_text">In particular, such schemes are known to approach the most accurate achievable finite-bit representation, dictated by rate-distortion theory, to within a controllable gap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, as well as achieve more accurate quantized representation compared to scalar quantization methods (probabilistic or deterministic) used in existing <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> works, while meeting the aforementioned requirements. Consequently, <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr> allows <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> to operate reliably under strict bit rate constraints, due to its ability to reduce the distortion induced by the need to quantize the model updates, which results in more accurate learned models with faster convergence compared to previously proposed methods.<span id="S1.p3.1.1.1.2.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We theoretically analyze the ability of the server to accurately recover the updated model when <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr> is employed. We show that the error induced by <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr> is mitigated by conventional federated averaging, and analyze the convergence of the global model to the one which minimize the loss function. Specifically, our analysis reveals that the resulting quantization error can be bounded by a term which vanishes as the number of users grows, regardless of the statistical model from which the data of each user is generated. This rigorously proves that the quantization distortion can be made arbitrarily small when a sufficient number of users contribute to the overall model.
Then, we study the convergence of  <span title="stochastic gradient descent" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_long">stochastic gradient descent</span></span> (<abbr title="stochastic gradient descent" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">SGD</span></abbr>)-based federated averaging with <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr> in a statistically heterogeneous setup, where the training available at each user obeys a different distribution, as is commonly the case in <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. We prove that for strongly convex and smooth objectives, the expected distance between the resulting <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> performance and the optimal one asymptotically decays as one over the number of iterations, which is the same order of convergence reported for <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> without communication constraints in heterogeneous setups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Finally, we show that these theoretical gains translate into <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> performance gains in a numerical study. We demonstrate that <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> with <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr> yields more accurate global models and faster convergence compared to previously proposed quantization approaches for such setups when operating under tight bit constraints of two and four bits per sample, considering synthetic data as well as the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets.</p>

Following requirement <a href="#S2.I1.i1" title="item A1 ‣ II-B Problem Formulation ‣ II System Model ‣ UVeQFed: Universal Vector Quantization for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">A1</span></span></a>, we utilize universal vector quantization, i.e., a quantization scheme which maps each set of continuous-amplitude values into a discrete representation in a manner which is ignorant of the underlying distribution. Common universal quantization methods are based on selection from an ensemble of source codes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, or alternatively, on subtractive dithering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, where the latter is simpler to implement being based on adding dither, i.e., noise, to the discretized quantity, but requires knowledge of the dither as it is subtracted from the discrete quantity when parsing the quantized value. The source of common randomness assumed in <a href="#S2.I1.i3" title="item A3 ‣ II-B Problem Formulation ‣ II System Model ‣ UVeQFed: Universal Vector Quantization for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">A3</span></span></a> implies that the server and the users can generate the same realizations of a dither signal.

It first normalizes the model updates and partitions it into sub-vectors of the lattice dimension, where the normalization is used to prevent overloading the finite lattice. Then, each vector is dithered before it is quantized to result in a distortion term which is not deterministically determined by the model updates, and is thus reduced by averaging. The quantized representation is compressed in lossless manner using entropy coding to further reduce its volume without inducing additional distortion.<span id="S3.SS1.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> These steps are detailed in the following:</span></span></p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we have proposed <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr>, which utilizes universal vector quantization methods to mitigate the effect of limited communication in <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr>. We first identified the specific requirements from quantization schemes used in <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> setups. Then, we proposed an encoding-decoding strategy based on dithered lattice quantization. We analyzed <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr>, proving that its error term is mitigated by federated averaging. We also characterized its convergence profile, showing that its asymptotic decay rate is the same an unquantized local <abbr title="stochastic gradient descent" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">SGD</span></abbr>. Our numerical study demonstrates that <abbr title="unviersal vector quantization for federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">UVeQFed</span></abbr> allows achieving more accurate recovery of model updates in each <abbr title="Federated learning" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">FL</span></abbr> iteration compared to previously proposed schemes for the same number of bits, and that its reduced distortion is translated into improved convergence with the non-synthetic MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets.</p>
