<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prevalent distributed machine learning scheme that enables collaborative model training without aggregating raw data. Cloud service providers further embrace Federated Learning as a Service (FLaaS), allowing data analysts to execute their FL training pipelines over differentially-protected data. Due to the intrinsic properties of differential privacy, the enforced privacy level on data blocks can be viewed as a privacy budget that requires careful scheduling to cater to diverse training pipelines. Existing privacy budget scheduling studies prioritize either efficiency or fairness individually. In this paper, we propose DPBalance, a novel privacy budget scheduling mechanism that jointly optimizes both efficiency and fairness. We first develop a comprehensive utility function incorporating data analyst-level dominant shares and FL-specific performance metrics. A sequential allocation mechanism is then designed using the Lagrange multiplier method and effective greedy heuristics. We theoretically prove that DPBalance satisfies Pareto Efficiency, Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, and Weak Strategy Proofness. We also theoretically prove the existence of a fairness-efficiency tradeoff in privacy budgeting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPBalance outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving an average efficiency improvement of <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="1.44\times\sim 3.49\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1b"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1">1.44</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0em" id="id1.1.m1.1.2">×</mo><mo lspace="0em" id="id1.1.m1.1.3">∼</mo><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.4">3.49</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="id1.1.m1.1.5">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">1.44\times\sim 3.49\times</annotation></semantics></math>, and an average fairness improvement of <math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="1.37\times\sim 24.32\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="id2.2.m2.1b"><mn id="id2.2.m2.1.1">1.37</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0em" id="id2.2.m2.1.2">×</mo><mo lspace="0em" id="id2.2.m2.1.3">∼</mo><mn id="id2.2.m2.1.4">24.32</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="id2.2.m2.1.5">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">1.37\times\sim 24.32\times</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of data on edge devices and the advancement of machine learning models drive the wide deployment of machine learning services. However, existing model training paradigm has raised severe privacy concerns since sensitive information needs to be uploaded to central servers to be analyzed. In response to this, privacy protection laws like the General Data Protection Regulation of EU (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> have been established worldwide, which further drives the emergence of federated learning (FL). FL is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning scheme where edge devices collaboratively train a global model while keeping their data local. It has been widely studied and deployed nowadays in applications such as Google keyboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, hotword detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and medical research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the advent of FL techniques, there has been a notable rise in distributed machine learning platforms like FedML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, FATE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> that offer a cloud-based “federated learning as a service” (FLaaS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. With the lifetime of a federated model training process being represented as a pipeline, these platforms facilitate training of diverse pipelines from data analysts using crowdsourced data owners.
To further protect and manage privacy loss, differential privacy (DP) is adopted in the FLaaS platform <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
It ensures the output of FL pipeline would not change much for any neighbor input datasets. DP is enforced by adding random noise to intermediate data like gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> of FL training. With the help of DP mechanisms, data owners can specify a privacy level on
their continuously generated data blocks. Each data analyst submits multiple FL pipelines with different training demands on the amount of data and its privacy level.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">According to the definition of DP, the training of a FL model on a data block introduces a certain level of privacy loss. Furthermore, this privacy loss is additive when data is utilized for multiple times. As a result, privacy in FLaaS platforms can be perceived as a consumable and quantifiable resource. The privacy level set by each crowdsourced data owner can be regarded as a privacy resource budget. Consequently, the efficient scheduling of FL pipelines to train on crowdsourced private data within the privacy budget becomes a critical challenge for FLaaS platforms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, while privacy can be treated as a resource, traditional resource allocation methods in distributed computing cannot be directly applied.
The primary distinction lies in the nature of privacy resources, which are characterized as <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">non-replenishable</span> and <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">continuously generated</span> as new data is collected. Unlike traditional resources such as CPU and memory which can be released for subsequent tasks after prior usage, privacy resources are not recoverable once their budget has been depleted. Furthermore, allocating available resources solely based on demand, a strategy that may work for CPU/ memory allocation, may be however inefficient or unfair for privacy resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works in privacy budget scheduling solely consider either efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> or fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. So far there is no privacy budget scheduling mechanism that jointly considers them both. In fact, efficiency and fairness of an allocation scheme are complicatedly affected by many factors.
The FL platform may hope to let the pipeline await to obtain a boarder view of the allocation market to achieve a better performance in system throughput and fairness. However, requiring the pipelines to wait for a long time increases the latency, which hurts the final efficiency from a different perspective.
In addition, naively allocating the majority of resources to those low-demand pipelines to maximize the number of completed pipelines may make the allocation among data analysts imbalanced, which hurts fairness.
Therefore, it is challenging to derive an allocation comprehensively taking efficiency and fairness into consideration in the context of FLaaS platform.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present the first privacy budget scheduling mechanism, DPBalance, that jointly considers efficiency and fairness.
We first develop a comprehensive utility function incorporating dominant shares across different FL pipelines to calculate data analyst-level fairness and platform-level efficiency. To capture the characteristics of FLaaS training, FL-specific performance metrics, such as the matching degree of data and FL models, are further integrated into the utility model. A sequential allocation mechanism is then designed using the Lagrange multiplier method and effective greedy heuristics.
From the perspective of fairness,
we theoretically prove that our solution can simultaneously satisfy four key economic properties. From the perspective of efficiency, the most efficient allocation result under the privacy preference is derived by maximizing platform’s utility function.
In summary, the contributions of our work are as follows.</p>

In FEDL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the uplink transmission rate is allocated to minimize energy cost and training time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a joint device scheduling and resource allocation policy is proposed to maximize model accuracy with a limited training time budget and latency threshold.
In q-FEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, fairness in accuracy across different users is considered when allocating edge devices.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, a deep learning-based auction mechanism is proposed to infer the valuation of each cluster head’s service to allocate clusters’ computation resources. However, none of these works consider privacy as resources and study privacy allocation problems in the emerging FLaaS setting, where multiple FL models need to be trained on top of privacy-preserved data owners.</p>

FL pipelines are associated with their training demands. A pipeline can only be successfully executed if its training demand is met. Pipelines are willing to get data blocks with more privacy loss as possible because it could improve the performance of trained pipelines. In addition, we assume data analysts are greedy and selfish. Greedy means the data analyst wants to satisfy more pipelines and selfish means the data analyst wouldn’t return the resource back if its pipelines could benefit from it.
The main objective of the FLaaS platform is to allocate a certain amount of data blocks efficiently and fairly under limited privacy resources. An unfair allocation scheme would discourage data analysts from participating and an inefficient allocation scheme would cause a waste of privacy resources.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FLaaS is an emerging cloud-based service that facilitates FL-based model training over crowdsourced data owners. Due to the intrinsic properties of DP, privacy budget set by data owners have to be carefully allocated to different data analysts to improve system efficiency and data analyst fairness. Existing privacy budget scheduling mechanisms consider either efficiency or fairness only. This paper completes the missing piece by proposing a new mechanism, DPBalance, that jointly optimizes efficiency and fairness. We prove theoretically that DPBalance guarantees four key economic properties and there exists an fairness-efficiency tradeoff in practical situations. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the superiority of DPBalance in efficiency and fairness performance.</p>
