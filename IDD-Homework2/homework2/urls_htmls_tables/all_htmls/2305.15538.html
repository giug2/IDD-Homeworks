However, end users may have specific requirements that the synthetic data must satisfy. Failure to meet these requirements could significantly reduce the utility of the data for downstream use. We introduce a post-processing technique that improves the utility of the synthetic data with respect to measures selected by the end user, while preserving strong privacy guarantees and dataset quality. Our technique involves resampling from the synthetic data to filter out samples that do not meet the selected utility measures, using an efficient stochastic first-order algorithm to find optimal resampling weights. Through comprehensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the utility of synthetic data across multiple benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art synthetic data generation algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The advancement of machine learning (ML) techniques relies on large amounts of training data. However, data collection also poses a significant risk of exposing private information. In recent years, several instances of privacy breaches have surfaced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, making it urgent to find a reliable way to share data. Today, the de facto standard for privacy protection is differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. DP ensures that useful information of a private dataset can be released while simultaneously preventing adversaries from identifying individuals’ personal data. DP has been utilized effectively in a wide variety of settings, by actors including the US Census <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and various large corporations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Generating private synthetic data is a crucial application of DP. It allows data scientists to train their ML models on the synthetic data while preserving a certain level of utility when deploying these models on real test data. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has emphasized its significance by hosting a series of competitions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. There is also significant work introducing new DP synthetic data generation mechanisms, including GAN-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, marginal-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, and workload-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> methods.
Existing methods for generating private synthetic data are task-agnostic—they do not take into account the downstream use cases of the synthetic data in the data generation process.
However, end users often have specific requirements for synthetic datasets to be successfully analyzed by their existing data science pipelines, which are often well-established, well-understood, heavily vetted, and difficult or expensive to change.
Unfortunately, synthetic data generated by existing methods may not always meet these requirements, resulting in reduced utility for their downstream use cases. This raises a fundamental question:</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Is it possible to improve a synthetic dataset’s utility on a set of selected measures while preserving its differential privacy guarantees?</em></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a post-processing procedure that enhances the quality of the synthetic data on a set of utility measures. These measures are usually based on the end user’s requirements for the synthetic data.
Our method solves an optimization problem to calculate the optimal resampling weights for each data point. We then use these weights to resample the synthetic dataset, eliminating data points that do not accurately reflect the real data based on the selected utility measures.
This post-processing procedure has many remarkable properties. Firstly, it is model-agnostic, meaning that it does not depend on any assumptions about how the synthetic data were generated. The synthetic data could be generated using either GAN-based, marginal-based, or workload-based methods.
Second, the post-processed data preserve the DP guarantees while maintaining the performance of downstream models on real data compared to models trained on the original synthetic data.
Finally, our algorithm is highly scalable, especially for high-dimensional data. It only requires a convex optimization whose number of variables is equal to the number of desired utility measures. We develop a stochastic first-order method that can efficiently solve this optimization problem. As a reference, we apply our algorithm to the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">home-credit</span> dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> which consists of 307,511 data points and 104 features, and it only takes around 4 mins to finish running.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our post-processing techniques. Our results show that this algorithm consistently improves the utility of the synthetic data on different selected measures, across multiple datasets, and for synthetic data generated using various state-of-the-art privacy mechanisms. Additionally, the downstream models trained on the post-processed data can achieve comparable (or even better) performance on real data compared to the models trained on the original synthetic data.
We demonstrate an application of our technique by using it to align the correlation matrix of the synthetic data with that of the real data.
The correlation matrix shows the correlation coefficients between pairs of features and is often used as a reference for feature selection. By applying our post-processing technique, we can ensure that the correlation matrix of the synthetic data closely matches that of the real data. This, for instance, can help downstream data scientists more accurately select a task-appropriate set of features for fitting their ML models, e.g. by thresholding the correlation with the desired target variable or using Lasso techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our proof techniques rely on an information-theoretic formulation known as information projection, which dates back to Csiszár’s seminal work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. This formulation has recently been successfully applied in several domains, such as large deviation theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, hypothesis testing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and fair machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Here we use information projection to “project” the empirical distribution of the synthetic data onto a set of distributions whose utility measures match those of the real data. We show that the optimal projected distribution can be expressed as an exponential tilting of the original distribution and determine the tilting parameters via a convex program in the dual space. To solve this optimization problem, we introduce a compositional proximal gradient algorithm, which is a stochastic first-order method and highly scalable for large dataset. Notably, this exponential tilting takes the form of a simple reweighting of the data points in the original synthetic dataset. Hence, our approach has the added benefit that it only reweights synthetic data points without changing their values, ensuring that the quality of the data points is not compromised and the support set of the overall dataset is not expanded.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Generating synthetic data using DP mechanisms is an active area of research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[see e.g., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Along this line of work, the closest ones to ours are workload-aware methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, which aim to ensure that the synthetic data perform well on a collection of queries.
Our work differs in three key features. First, all existing approaches focus on generating private synthetic data from scratch, while we aim to post-process synthetic data to downweight samples that do not accurately represent the real data under the specified utility measures. As a result, our approach is more efficient as it does not need to fit a graphical model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> or a neural network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> to represent the data distribution, and it is more extendable, allowing a single synthetic dataset to be quickly post-processed multiple times for different sets of utility measures as needed by downstream users. Second, some existing work may not scale well to large datasets as they either require solving an integer program multiple times <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> or need to solve a large-scale optimization problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In contrast, our approach is highly scalable, as it only requires solving a convex program whose number of variables is equal to the number of specified utility measures. Third, existing work often evaluates the quality of the synthetic data by how well it preserves key statistics (e.g., 3-way marginals) of the real data. In contrast, in our experiments, we evaluate our approach on the more stringent and realistic test of training various downstream ML models on the synthetic data and measuring their performance on real test data. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can enhance the utility of synthetic data on selected measures without compromising their downstream quality.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">Our work introduces a post-processing procedure for improving the utility of a given synthetic dataset based on selected measures. As a special case, our approach can be applied to post-process publicly available datasets. In this regard, this work is related to public-data-assisted methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[see e.g., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, which leverage public data for saving privacy budgets.

Finally, our work is related with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, which proposes to post-process outputs from differentially private GAN-based models for improving the quality of the generated synthetic data. However, their method is tailored to GAN-based privacy mechanisms while our approach is model-agnostic. This versatility is crucial, given that marginal-based and workload-based mechanisms often yield higher quality synthetic tabular data, as evidenced by benchmark experiments in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. Our experiments indicate that our method consistently improves the utility of synthetic data produced by all kinds of privacy mechanisms, even when the initial synthetic data are of high quality.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present our main result: a post-processing procedure for improving the utility of a synthetic dataset. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem that projects the probability distribution of the synthetic data onto a set of distributions that align the utility measures with the (noisy) real data. We prove that the optimal projected distribution can be expressed in a closed form, which is an exponentially tilted distribution of the original synthetic data distribution. To compute the tilting parameters, we introduce a stochastic first-order method and leverage the tilting parameters to resample from the synthetic data. By doing so, we filter out synthetic data that inaccurately represent the real data on the selected set of utility measures.</p>

As our approach only reweights synthetic data without altering their values, the quality of the data points is preserved and the support set of the overall dataset is not expanded. Moreover, our numerical experiments demonstrate that downstream predictive models trained on the post-processed synthetic data can achieve comparable or even better performance on real data than those trained on the original synthetic data.</p>

All the datasets have a target variable that can be used for a downstream prediction task.
We use four existing DP mechanisms—<span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">AIM</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, <span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">MST</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, <span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">DPCTGAN</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, and <span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">PATECTGAN</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>—to generate private synthetic data.

Additionally, we measure the average Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance between the marginal distributions of synthetic and real data (0: identical distribution; 1: totally different distributions) and the average inverse KL-divergence (0: totally different distributions; 1: identical distribution). As shown, our technique consistently improves the utility of the synthetic data across all datasets and all DP mechanisms without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical metrics.</figcaption>

As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.</p>

The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment.
Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Conclusion and Limitations</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The use of private synthetic data allows for data sharing without compromising individuals’ private information. In practice, end users typically have specific requirements that the synthetic data must meet, which are often derived from their standard data science pipeline. Failure to meet these requirements can diminish the usefulness of the synthetic data. To address this issue, we introduce a theoretically-grounded post-processing procedure for improving a synthetic dataset’s utility on a selected set of measures. This procedure filters out samples that do not accurately reflect the real data, while still maintaining DP guarantees. We also present a scalable algorithm for computing resampling weights and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe there is a crucial need for future research to comprehend the capabilities and limitations of private synthetic data from various perspectives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[see e.g., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, for further discussions]</cite>. It should be noted that synthetic data generation is not intended to replace real data, and any model trained on synthetic data must be thoroughly evaluated before deployment on real data. In cases a ML model trained on synthetic data exhibits algorithmic bias upon deployment on real data, it becomes imperative to identify the source of bias and repair the model by querying the real data with a privacy mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When generating synthetic data using DP mechanisms, outliers may receive higher noise, which can have a greater impact on minority groups. Consequently, ML models trained on DP-synthetic data by downstream users may demonstrate a disparate impact when deployed on real data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. This is true even when using fairness-intervention algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> during model training because the synthetic data follows a different probability distribution than real data. One can potentially apply our post-processing techniques to resample synthetic data and eliminate samples that do not reflect the underlying distribution of the population groups, while ensuring sample diversity. By doing so, they can achieve a higher fairness-accuracy curve when deploying downstream ML models trained on the post-processed synthetic data on real data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another promising avenue of research is to investigate the data structure in cases where a user or a company can provide multiple records to the dataset. Financial data, for instance, is typically collected over time and presented as a time series. While it is possible to combine all of a user’s data into a single row, this approach can lead to an unmanageably unbounded feature domain and limit the effectiveness of the synthetic data. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore other privacy notions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[see e.g., <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and develop strategies for optimizing higher privacy-utility trade-offs under special data structures.</p>
