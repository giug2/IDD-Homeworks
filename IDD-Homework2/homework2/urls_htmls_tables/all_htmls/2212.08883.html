<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning achieves joint training of deep models by connecting decentralized data sources, which can significantly mitigate the risk of privacy leakage. However, in a more general case, the distributions of labels among clients are different, called “label distribution skew”. Directly applying conventional federated learning without consideration of label distribution skew issue significantly hurts the performance of the global model. To this end, we propose a novel federated learning method, named FedMGD, to alleviate the performance degradation caused by the label distribution skew issue. It introduces a global Generative Adversarial Network to model the global data distribution without access to local datasets, so the global model can be trained using the global information of data distribution without privacy leakage. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on several public benchmarks.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the process of deep learning technology, massive training data play a vital role.
However, due to some security or privacy issues in some scenarios, access to data is under strict restriction.
The data cannot flow out of the corresponding institution, and the lack of data results in the ineffective training of machine learning models.
The above data dilemma significantly limits the performance of the trained model and even leads to serious consequences.
For example, Watson, a famous artificial intelligence in the medical field, may cause death once it mistakenly gives a drug.
To alleviate the above dilemma, a novel framework for machine learning, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is proposed, which provides more data sources for model training through multi-party collaboration without sharing local private data.
However, there is generally a large difference in the distribution among clients, which leads to performance degradation of conventional federated learning methods, named Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID). Non-IID is one of the important causes of training bias in federated learning, and it has different expressions in different scenarios. Non-IID scenarios in federated learning are carefully delineated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, where data heterogeneity caused by differences in the distribution of labels is called label distribution skew. This is the most common scenario in distributed environments that manifests itself in a different distribution of labels among clients, for example, when the client’s data is limited by factors such as geography, the distribution of labels appears significantly different — pandas are only found in China or zoos.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, several methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> are proposed to restrict the differences between local and server models in the parameter space, which have shown success in some applications.
However, when the data or labels among clients are highly heterogeneous, the above approaches can not take full use of the information in dispersed data, and degrade the performance of the aggregated global model.
Therefore, a potential way to address the label distribution skew issue in federated learning is to model the global data distribution among clients. Most existing global data distribution modeling federated learning methods require some auxiliary information such as proxy dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> or pre-known knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Unfortunately, the requirement of these methods is to directly collect private data or data information from clients, which violates the privacy preserving policy and is not applicable to federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning method, named FedMGD, which allows the global model to obtain global information about data distribution across clients without incurring the privacy leakage issue from clients and thus improves its performance.
Specifically, we use the global distribution information obtained from modeling to refine the aggregation model, by which we can reduce the differences in distribution among clients and thereby mitigate the hazards caused by label distribution skew. In addition, to ensure that the learned global information generated is more similar to the real data, we constrain by both image authenticity and semantic authenticity, which makes FedMGD still maintain high performance in some noisy datasets.
To achieve our design goal, our federated learning scheme follows a two-stage procedure.
The advantage of this design is to avoid the inability of the model to accurately describe the local label distribution information of the client after federated learning aggregation.
In the first stage, we adopt a federated Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, where the generator in the server generates samples as the ones from clients and the discriminator in the corresponding client distinguishes generated samples from the local ones. After the training of federated GAN accomplishes, the generator can effectively capture global information about data distribution across clients.
However, directly aggregating the generator parameters used by the federated GAN is also affected by the label distribution skew, which is not conducive to modeling the global distribution. Therefore, we adapted the architecture of the federated GAN and introduced a Realistic Score to more accurately describe the distribution information of the local data.
In the second stage, we first aggregate the local trained models from clients and then refine the aggregated model using the samples synthesized by the above generator.
In this way, the aggregated global model can significantly benefit from the global information captured by the generator.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning scheme that aims to address data collaboration and protect privacy preserving. It allows multiple participants to train machine learning models collaboratively without exposing local data. Federated learning was first proposed by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> to address the problem of updating models locally on Android phones for users. Since federated learning provides an effective solution to the current "Isolated Data Island" problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, it has been gradually used in finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and other fields.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the collaborative multi-party approach in federated learning introduces new issues, mainly in terms of data privacy security and Non-IID datasets. For data privacy security, it has been shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> that federated learning does not fully guarantee data security, and even only gradient exchange among the participants may cause data privacy leakage. The current popular solutions mainly combine Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Differential Privacy (DP) to ensure privacy security issues on the federated learning process and results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, since most of the real world data are distributed in a Non-IID way, this distribution makes the training of models in federated learning very difficult. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> provides a detailed division of Non-IID scenarios in federated learning, in which the Non-IID caused by the behaviors and habits of different participants is called Feature distribution skew <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>; and the difference of label distribution among participants due to the limitation of geographical location and other factors, this Non-IID is called Label distribution skew, which is also the problem focused on in this paper.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The label distribution skew in federation learning refers to the differences in the distribution of data labels among the clients participating in federated learning.
FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is a classical algorithm for solving federated learning problems, which has attracted wide attention because of its simplicity and low communication cost. It learns knowledge from the decentralized data through the transfer and aggregation of model parameters. Unfortunately, in the scenario of label distribution skew, the performance of FedAvg will drop significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, many studies have developed different solutions to solve the problem caused by label distribution skew. Some studies restrict the differences between local and server models in the parameter space.
For example, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> introduced dynamic regularization to ensure the stability of the model in a highly heterogeneous environment by penalizing updates away from the server model. SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> corrects deviation in local updates by introducing additional control variables. However, these approaches focus on reducing the differences between the local and global models without taking full advantage of the information contained in the dispersed data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Other methods are based on knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. By using a small portion of the data collected from the clients to guide global model training, the global model can integrate knowledge from the local and mitigate the negative effects of aggregating different data distributions.
In addition to the above methods, there are many studies that also strive to reduce the hazards due to label distribution skew by changing the global target or data distribution. Among them, several studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> force the data to obey uniform distribution by modeling the target distribution.
Other studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> suggest that collecting a small portion of data from clients to build a globally shared dataset can reduce the differences in data distribution across clients and improve the performance of the model on label distribution skew data.
However, the prerequisites for collecting data from clients may make this approach infeasible in many scenarios with strict privacy requirements. Therefore, we need a method to mitigate the label distribution skew problem in federated learning by obtaining the same data as the client label distribution without violating user privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the privacy issues associated with data collection in federated distillation methods, Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed FedGen, a data-free knowledge distillation method. It integrates knowledge from the prediction results of the local model by learning a lightweight generator at the server and then distributes the learned knowledge via broadcast and as an inductive bias to regulate the local training. Although FedGen does not collect data from the client directly, the client needs to count and upload the label information of this participating training during each round of communication with the server. This way of obtaining the label distribution also causes the leakage of local distribution information.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to better learn global information from the decentralized data distribution, we introduce a distributed GAN to model the global data distribution, thus alleviating the performance degradation caused by label distribution skew in federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the traditional GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the generator and discriminator learn the data distribution through mutual confrontation.
Distributed GAN is another application of GAN in a distributed environment.
In federated learning, distributed GAN is mainly active in two aspects: one is how to use GAN to attack the client in order to obtain its private data.
In the studies of Hitaj et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, they used GAN to perform recovery attacks on the client’s private data from other clients and the server side, respectively.
The other focuses on how to generate higher quality data within the constraints of federated learning environments.
For example, McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> propose to train a generator with different privacy protection levels in federated learning, allowing the model to examine data without direct access to real data. FedGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> was proposed to train GAN by parameter exchange in a federated scenario. Hardy et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> proposed a new GAN structure for a distributed environment. On this basis, Chang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> supplemented the missing modes of medical images through generation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, these methods default to data belonging to IID, which is not suitable for data modeling in label offset scenarios. Recently, Yonetani et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed a strategy to solve the problem of label distribution skew in different clients, called Forgiver-First Update (F2U). Although F2U can be used in learning the distribution of some rare classes, the unsupervised approach used ignores the importance of labeling (semantic) information. In the unsupervised label distribution skew scenario, the generated data is likely to be concentrated in only a few classes, which is not conducive to modeling the global data distribution, and thus the use of labels to constrain the type of generated data is necessary. In addition, unlabeled data bring new challenges for the subsequent training of downstream models.</p>

Then we describe the above stages in detail in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Generative Adversarial Stage ‣ 4 Method ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a> and Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Federated Enhancement Stage ‣ 4 Method ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>, respectively.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This training approach allows learning the rare classes and avoids the negative effect of poorly trained model on the clients.
However, the unsupervised approach used by F2U ignores the importance of labeling information. In the unsupervised label distribution skew scenario, the generated data is likely to be concentrated in only a few classes, which is not conducive to modeling the global data distribution, and thus the use of labels to constrain the type of generated data is necessary. In addition, unlabeled data bring new challenges for the subsequent training of downstream models.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In this way, we can obtain additional global data without violating client privacy for federated learning, which can further improves the performance of the global model in the scenario of label distribution skew.
In addition, we adopt a conditional generator in our GAN, which synthesizes samples by the given labels in a controllable manner.
Specifically, the training process ensures that the data for each class is fully trained by preset labels for the generator <math id="S4.SS1.p9.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{G}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p9.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS1.p9.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p9.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒢</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p9.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.p9.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p9.1.m1.1.1">𝒢</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p9.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{G}</annotation></semantics></math>. In this case, the preset labels are sampled using Server Sampling, i.e., uniform sampling among all classes at the server side. We will discuss the proposed sampling method in Section <a href="#S5.SS3.SSS4" title="5.3.4 Sampling Methods in FedMGD. ‣ 5.3 Ablation Experiment ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3.4</span></a>.
Finally, the classifier from the generative adversarial stage can also be directly used in the subsequent federated enhancement stage.</p>

In this stage, we use the knowledge obtained from global modeling to refine the aggregation model and mitigate the hazards caused by the label distribution skew problem. In this way, we re-correct the problem that the aggregation model is inconsistent with the global optimization direction due to local distribution differences. And because the generator provides additional globally distributed data to the aggregation model, it further improves the performance and generalization of the aggregation model. We prove the validity of the proposed method in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>.</p>

SVHN is a dataset consisting of different house numbers in street view images. CIFAR10 is a dataset including 10 classes of color images from the real world, making the task more difficult because it contains more noise. We divide 10% of the data as public test set and distribute the rest data over the clients for locally training and testing. The whole process is controlled by random seeds.

For FedMGD, in the generative adversarial stage the server sends generated data of size 64 to the clients for GAN training at each round of communication. In the federated enhancement stage, the generator synthesizes samples of size 2048 per round to refine the global model.
In the classification task, we conduct several experiments and choose the accuracy after the last round of averaging as the final result.
In addition, some of the curves are smoothed for better presentation of the results.
Finally, to ensure the effectiveness of our method on different number of clients, we have verified it on 5 and 10 clients respectively.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we compare the performance of FedMGD and state-of-the-art methods from two main perspectives: global and local. First, from a global perspective, we use accuracy as a metric to verify the performance of FedMGD and SOAT algorithms in the global test set. Then, from a local perspective, we compare the difference in performance performance between FedMGD and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the fairness of the model among clients.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare the accuracy of all algorithms in the global test set under different degrees of label distribution skew, and the results are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.1.3 Baselines ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
We observe that FedMGD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in most cases, especially in highly heterogeneous scenario.
Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2.1 Accuracy on The Global Test Set. ‣ 5.2 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> visualizes the performance of all algorithms under different degrees of label distribution skew.
The figure shows that FedMGD exhibits more stable performance when the heterogeneity of the data changes.
Compared with other methods, FedGen’s accuracy decreases when there is more noise in training data. This may be because the lightweight generator in FedGen is vulnerable to noise in the sample, resulting in less information about the features captured from the sample.
In contrast, FedMGD uses a more sophisticated approach to data generation, thus ensuring the validity of the generated data.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To increase the degree of label distribution skew among the clients, we distribute the labels among 10 clients. Each client has fewer label classes compared to the case with 5 clients.
The results are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.1.3 Baselines ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, where FedMGD can still maintain higher performance compared to other algorithms in the 10 clients scenario.
Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5.2.1 Accuracy on The Global Test Set. ‣ 5.2 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows how the performance of the different algorithms changes when the data is divided into scenarios with 10 clients.
Compared to the scenario with 5 clients, FedMGD has a greater performance improvement compared to the baseline algorithm in the case of a more extreme label distribution.
In other words, in scenarios with a more skewed label distribution, the harm caused by the skewed label distribution to the model is reduced because FedMGD uses a global modeling approach to correct the model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the label distribution skew scenario, the same model may have different performance in different clients, and we call this difference in performance between clients the local fairness of the model.
We compare the performance of models trained by FedMGD with state-of-the-art Methods on the client test set and demonstrate that the fairness of the models on the client is effectively improved by learning the knowledge of the global distribution.
We use the standard deviation of the accuracy of the algorithms on the local test sets of different clients as a measure, and the results are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2.2 Local Fairness of Different Models. ‣ 5.2 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
We have observed that FedMGD maintains a small difference in performance across clients in all scenarios.
This is due to the fact that FedMGD improves the compatibility of the global model under heterogeneous data distribution by using global information to refine the aggregated model, thus allowing the model to perform more fairly (with less performance difference) across clients.</p>

First, we verify that the proposed Realistic Score is more suitable for the case of label distribution skewing by comparing it with the collected data and F2U. Then, to demonstrate the quality of the data generated by FedMGD in the case of skewed label distribution, we compare it with several distributed generation models. Finally, we validate the rationality of FedMGD’s preset label sampling approach.</p>

Before that, we need a downstream task that can use different data sources and use the model accuracy of the downstream task as a measure.

We use 5% real data collected from customers as an additional data source and compare it under different label bias scenarios using unlabeled and labeled methods.
As shown in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.3.1 Realistic Score in FedMGD ‣ 5.3 Ablation Experiment ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the model has better performance when the labeled real data is used as an additional data source, but using the way the data is collected may leak more users’ privacy.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.2.2 Local Fairness of Different Models. ‣ 5.2 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, FedDF(labeled real data) and FedDF(unlabeled real data) are the accuracies of training models using 5% of real data with and without labels, respectively. The figure demonstrates that the accuracy of the trained model using real labeled data is significantly higher than that of the trained model using unlabeled real data. This proves that labels play an important role in model training and the necessity of introducing semantic truth in the Realistic Score.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(3) Comparison with F2U.</span> In this experiment, we compare the proposed Realistic Score with the generator trained by the Largest Score proposed in F2U. As shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.3.1 Realistic Score in FedMGD ‣ 5.3 Ablation Experiment ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the generator of FedMGD trained by Realistic Score can reach better results as the data source of FedDF. Because only the data realness is concerned in F2U and ignore the label realness information, the Realistic Score approach is more suitable for global modeling of data under label distribution skew.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.2.2 Local Fairness of Different Models. ‣ 5.2 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, F2U+FedDF(unlabeled w/o real data) and FedMGD+FedDF(w/o real data) are the accuracy curves of the trained models using F2U and FedMGD as the data source of FedDF, respectively. Since FedMGD learns more information about the label distribution using Realistic Score, the accuracy of the training model is higher than that of the F2U method.</p>

We can observe that the accuracy of FedMGD using two-stage for updating is significantly higher on different datasets than the approach that takes one stage for updating. This is due to the fact that in the original generative adversarial stage, the local classifier only uses the client-side local dataset for learning and describes the local label distribution information to the server through Realistic Score. However, in the process of using a stage update, as the classification model is aggregated in the global modeling process, the local model using aggregation cannot accurately describe the local label distribution information of the client.

We show the variation in accuracy for two different procedures for training the model in Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 5.3.3 Two-Stage vs. One-Stage FedMGD ‣ 5.3 Ablation Experiment ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
It is shown from the figure that the accuracy of the model trained using the two-stage procedure is significantly higher than that using the one-stage procedure. Moreover, the difference in the accuracy of the trained models of the two different procedures gradually increases with the increase of the label distribution skew between clients.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we compare the effects of modeling the global data distribution using different generator preset label sampling methods and validate the rationality of using server-side sampling in FedMGD.
Based on the characteristics of data distribution in a distributed environment, we propose two different sampling methods, Client Sampling and Server Sampling. Client sampling refers to collecting the distribution of each label in the client, so that the preset labels of the generator are sampled according to the label distribution in the client. Server Sampling means that the generator’s preset tags are sampled on the server side using a uniform distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, the CIFAR10 data set is used, and the data is divided into 4 clients according to the Dirichlet distribution to ensure that the label distribution and the total amount of data of each client are different. The experimental results are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 5.3.4 Sampling Methods in FedMGD. ‣ 5.3 Ablation Experiment ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. In different label distribution skew scenarios, the accuracy of the resulting model is higher when the generator preset label uses the server method to sample the result. This is because the use of uniform sampling in the generative adversarial stage in FedMGD can better learn the data information of each category, which is more conducive to refine the overall label distribution skew. We show the accuracy variation of the two methods in Figure <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 5.3.4 Sampling Methods in FedMGD. ‣ 5.3 Ablation Experiment ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Modeling Global Distribution for Federated Learning with Label Distribution Skew" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. The accuracy of the model trained using server sampling in the figure is significantly higher than client sampling, which demonstrates the validity of our method.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we mainly investigate how to mitigate the impact of label distribution skew on the performance of federated learning models.
We propose a method FedMGD to mitigate the degraded model performance when aggregating heterogeneous data distributions by modeling the global data distribution.
It improves the compatibility of the global model under heterogeneous data distribution by using global information to refine the aggregated model.
In our experiments, FedMGD has better performance in the scenarios of label distribution skew compared to baseline methods.
In addition, we demonstrate through a series of ablation experiments that FedMGD can indeed better model the global data distribution in a label distribution skew scenario and it provides a novel solution for data source of downstream tasks.
In future research, we will explore a method for global modeling that is based on any federated learning approach to reduce the performance degradation caused by label distribution skew.</p>
