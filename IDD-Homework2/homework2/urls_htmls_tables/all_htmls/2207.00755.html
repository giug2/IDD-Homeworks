<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">Nowadays wireless communication is rapidly reshaping entire industry sectors. In particular, mobile edge computing (MEC) as an enabling technology for industrial Internet of things (IIoT) brings powerful computing/storage infrastructure closer to the mobile terminals and, thereby, significantly lowers the response latency. To reap the benefit of proactive caching at the network edge, precise knowledge on the popularity pattern among the end devices is essential. However, (i) the spatiotemporal variability of content popularity, (ii) the data deficiency in privacy-preserving system, (iii) the costly manual labels in supervised learning as well as (iv) the not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) user behaviors pose tough challenges to the acquisition and prediction of content popularities. In this article, we propose an unsupervised and privacy-preserving popularity prediction framework for MEC-enabled IIoT to achieve a high popularity prediction accuracy while addressing the challenges. Specifically, the concepts of local and global popularities are introduced and the time-varying popularity of each user is modelled as a model-free Markov chain. On this basis, we derive and validate the essential relationship between the local and global popularities and then propose an unsupervised recurrent federated learning (URFL) algorithm to predict the distributed popularity while achieving privacy preservation and unsupervised training. Moreover, a federated loss-weighted averaging (FedLWA) scheme for the parameter aggregation is further designed to alleviate the problem of non-i.i.d. user behaviors. Simulations indicate that the proposed framework can enhance the prediction accuracy in terms of a reduced root-mean-squared error by up to <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="60.5\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">60.5</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">60.5</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">60.5\%</annotation></semantics></math>–<math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="68.7\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">68.7</mn><mo id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.2">68.7</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">68.7\%</annotation></semantics></math> compared to other baseline methods, i.e., recommendation algorithms, centralized learning algorithms, and other distributed learning algorithms.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emerging industrial Internet of things (IIoT), also colloquially known as Industry 4.0, interconnects isolated industrial assets by leveraging the growing ubiquity of wireless communication technologies. By harvesting the rich supply of data from various networked embedded sensors, this new paradigm promises the opportunity to revolutionize production and manufacturing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, to process such an enormous amount of data and to handle the massive requests generated by ubiquitous wireless devices especially under the stringent requirements of reliability, latency, security and privacy, are incredibly challenging. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which co-locates storage and processing resources at the network edge, represents an effective framework to provision IIoT services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and to mitigate the surging traffic burden of the data centers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Dense deployment of edge nodes (ENs), i.e., radio access points or micro base stations, allows proximal and immediate access to the IIoT services. In an information-centric networking, proactive edge caching (EC) is considered a cost-effective approach to address the backhaul bottleneck problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and to reduce the content retrieval/handover latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The explorations of optimal EC policies in MEC-enabled IIoT networks have been investigated in many previous studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, many of relevant works, i.e., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, assume that the content popularity can be <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a priori</span> given and remains constant during the services, which is actually inconsistent with the reality. To be more realistic, some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> have considered the unknown popularity and explored the end-to-end learning approach to learn the EC policy directly from the request data so as to avoid the popularity prediction. Although circumventing popularity prediction by introducing the end-to end machine learning is indeed a research direction of the EC policy optimization, the popularity reflects the inherent pattern of user interests and directly determines the generation of content requests and thus, plays the most direct and decisive role in the EC policy. Significant improvements of EC performance provided by the popularity prediction have been demonstrated in literatures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the investigation of popularity prediction. Generally, content popularity depends on the user interest, which is complicated and spatiotemporal varying and, thus, is unavailable in advance no matter which caching policy is applied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. When considering the spatiotemporal varying characteristic of content popularities in the real world, the performance of EC policies is largely determined by the selection mechanism of popular data that is worthwhile caching from a massive deluge of data traffic, which in turn relies on the accuracy of popularity prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The potential of the popularity prediction has attracted the attentions of researchers and many progresses have been achieved in relevant works, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>–<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. However, there are still open challenges for the popularity prediction. 1) <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Spatiotemporal variability</span>: Due to the complex and changeable subjective attributes of end users/devices such as the subjective interests of human and the intrinsic task characteristics of devices, the content popularity is spatiotemporal varying and pose tough challenges to its prediction accuracy. 2) <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Privacy preservation</span>: In many scenarios such as the healthcare and automotive-related industries, the terminal data is private and needs to be protected from external access. Thus, privacy requirements prevent the data sharing among devices and center servers, which leads to the data deficiency for the data-driven centralized popularity prediction methods. 3) <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Costly manual labeling</span>: Caused by the unobservability of popularity in the realistic environment, labelling popularities in manual for the popularity prediction is costly and challenging, which brings a technical bottleneck to many prediction approaches based on supervised learning. 4) <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) behaviors</span>: Due to the subjectivity of user interests, user behaviors are non-i.i.d., which can violate the assumption in machine learning that datas are independent and identically distributed and sequentially causes many issues, i.e., feature distribution skew, concept drift, quantity skew, etc., for learning-based prediction methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the light of the above observations, the objective of this study is to design a distributed deep learning algorithm to predict the dynamic content popularities in a MEC-enabled IIoT system while preserving the data privacy of end devices and circumventing the costly manual labeling. To explore the insightful relations between the local and global popularities is another important consideration in this paper. To this end, the mathematical derivation and simulation validation of the relations among the popularities in system are provided, and a novel unsupervised recurrent federated learning (URFL) algorithm with a novel federated loss-weighted averaging (FedLWA) parameter aggregation scheme are also proposed.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The complex and varied user interest/need poses enormous challenges for accurately predicting the dynamic popularity. To this end, many different algorithms have been proposed in the literature to predict the dynamic popularity over the recent years. Some inspiring examples include the time-series prediction method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the social-driven prediction method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and the statistics-based prediction method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Jiang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed an online content popularity prediction algorithm by exploiting the content features and user preferences, where the user preferences were learned offline from the historically requested information. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, an auto-encoder (AE) neural network was combined with the long short-term memory module to predict the popularity by extracting time-series features from the historical requests of users. Nevertheless, the time-sequence prediction approaches in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> rely heavily on the privacy of users such as historical requests to improve the prediction accuracy, which is intolerable for those privacy-sensitive users and not appropriate for the privacy-preserving systems. Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> explored the dynamically changing and evolving propagation patterns of videos in social media and the content popularity could be forecasted in a timely fashion. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the social relationships among a small number of users were explored to bridge the gap between prediction accuracy and small population. A social-driven propagation dynamics model was proposed therein to improve the popularity prediction accuracy. However, as the hidden features can only be extracted from massive amounts of social information accumulated over a long-term time, the timeliness and privacy concerns of the social-driven prediction methods are questioned. Statistical prediction methods based on regression analysis have also been examined. For instance, Trzcinśki et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> used support vector regression based on Gaussian radial basis functions to predict the online video popularity. Similarly, a Bayesian hierarchical probabilistic model was designed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to regress the content popularity in an EC network. While the existing statistical approaches show potentials in achieving accurate and stable prediction, they are still far from practical use. For instance, the selection of probabilistic models in statistics-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> has critical impacts on the prediction performance, but the selection criteria are unclear and impossible to be <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a priori</span> given in the real world. Most importantly, they inevitably raise privacy issues due to the fact that statistics-based methods require access to the historical request log data of users for popularity prediction.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a matter of fact, private data leakage vulnerabilities in IIoT systems, especially in the healthcare and automotive-related industries, can lead to catastrophic consequences such as endangering user safety and causing severe property loss for data providers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. The resultant privacy preservation constraint makes the dynamic popularity prediction in EC even trickier. Recently, the disruptive blockchain technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> shows superiority in enhancing data security and privacy preservation due to its anonymity, inherent decentralization, and trust properties. Nevertheless, the blockchain technique is essentially a distributed database of records and it has no interface for user behavior analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. We argue that the knotty problem of privacy-preserving popularity prediction can be tacked by leveraging the recent advances of distributed deep learning, particularly the federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. FL has emerged as a distributed artificially intelligence (AI) approach, by coordinating multiple devices to perform AI training without sharing raw data for privacy enhancement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

Literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> investigates the image classification problem and proposes a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving distributed machine learning framework based on the FL cooperating with CNNs. The superior classification accuracy shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> demonstrates the strong ability of the FL cooperating with CNNs in image feature extraction while preserving privacy. However, the architecture of CNNs is not appropriate for the feature extraction of sequence data which is rather important to wireless communication systems. RNNs, as an efficient architecture of sequence data processing, cooperating with FL is viewed as a promising framework for privacy-preserving data processing in wireless communication systems. For instance, Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> provide a FL-based gated recurrent unit neural network for traffic flow prediction while providing reliable data privacy preservation. Although FL integrating with DNNs has been widely investigated, many existing works,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, adopt the supervised learning with costly manual labels which poses significant challenges to their practical applications, especially to practical popularity prediction. The spatiotemporal variability and unobservability of the content popularity lead to the difficulty in manually obtaining the popularity labels. Therefore, we extending FL to an unsupervised paradigm in this paper to address the challenges on the manual labelling of popularities. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised FL incorporating RNNs to effectively predict popularities from sequences of historical requests without labels while preserving user privacy. Moreover, we further design a parameter aggregation to alleviate the non-i.i.d. problem which is an open challenge in the research field of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The MEC framework enables FL in the wireless communication networks with the supply of abundant and closer computing/caching resources. A comprehensive survey of FL from the perspective of fundamentals, challenges, solutions, and applications in MEC networks can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Therein, FL-based privacy-preserving popularity prediction in MEC networks has been explored in many works, i.e.,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, many challenges still remain to be addressed. In a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, the center server is prohibited from snooping on users’ private data, while only the local MEC server is permitted to collect and learn from the historical requests of users. This scheme relies on authorization management and is susceptible to unauthorized access provided by the unreliable network operator or gained by malicious cracking. In addition, the deep learning method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> requires manual labeling in advance, which unfortunately is costly and infeasible in real implementation. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed an FL-based method to realize the privacy-preserving EC. On the basis of literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, Cui et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> utilized blockchain to further improve the security of FL implementation. However, the EC policies considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> are both built on the similarities between users and contents, which is calculated by potential features extracted from historical requests of users. The similarity calculated in these two literatures is just a rough estimation of popular contents rather than the actual popularity. Thus, the content popularity which represents the accurate requested probability of each content has not been predicted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the relationship between the client-side popularity and server-side popularity has not been explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, the content popularity has been predicted while the popularity relationship between the client side and server side is preliminarily explored. Nonetheless, the explorations of the relationship between client-side and server-side popularities were sketchy and empirical in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, which was reflected in the thoughtlessness of user request arrival rate as well as the absence of any verification for the given relationship. In this paper, we introduce the concept of local popularity at user side and global popularity at MEC server side respectively, and further derive and validate the mathematical relationship between these two popularity types.</p>

Nevertheless, the temporal variability of the popularity caused by the time-varying user interests has not been explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, sampling from the real popularity distribution at the MEC server side is required to generate the input of the prediction model during the local training phase. However, the real popularity distribution at the MEC server side depends on the subjective interests of users within the entire service area and thus is extremly hard to obtain <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a priori</span>. In our study, we consider the local and global popularities both time-varying and unavailable so as to be more closely aligned with reality. In addition, we can further observe from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> that local users are supposed to share or upload their request history when making online predictions, so as to generate the input of the prediction model. Indeed, this kind of sharing or upload violates the privacy-preserving requirement. The fundamental reason why these works need to collect users’ request history for the global prediction can be attributed to the consistency requirement in the typical FL framework, which demands that the model structures and model inputs should be exactly the same between the local and global sides <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. To mitigate the risk of privacy leakage caused by the collection of user request history, we design the input structure of the local and global models to break the consistency requirement on model inputs, and then realize the distributed training and prediction without any external access to user’s historical requests except itself.</p>

One MEC server, which can be the general-purpose computer or server, is placed on the edge node between the cloud and the end sides. The edge node can directly provide the content services supported by the caching capability of the MEC server. Moreover, the prediction models for popularity prediction can be placed on the user equipments (UEs) and the edge node benefited from the rapidly evolving computing capabilities of the UEs and the MEC server.

Apparently, the global popularity depends on all the local popularities within the service area, and the MEC server as a service provider can significantly improve its caching efficiency under the guidance of accurate knowledge of the global popularity. However, as will be elaborated in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV URFL FOR EDGE POPULARITY PREDICTION ‣ Unsupervised Recurrent Federated Learning for Edge Popularity Prediction in Privacy-Preserving Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, the prediction of the global popularity is much more complicated than that of the local popularity due to the different behavior patterns of different users as well as the privacy-preserving constraint.</p>

Moreover, as stated in some data privacy legislations such as the European Commission’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, users have the right to require the responsible party to delete the individual data records about them. Thus, to respond with the implementation of GDPR, the burn-after-read principle as the privacy-preserving mechanism is implemented in the MEC servers, i.e., the request information from users must be immediately deleted from the memory of the MEC server once the contents have been scheduled. The MEC servers are not allowed to hold any historical information of any users.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This subsection presents the design of the URFL framework and its application to the privacy-preserving edge popularity prediction. The proposed architecture of URFL is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-D Privacy-preserving Mechanism ‣ III SYSTEM MODEL ‣ Unsupervised Recurrent Federated Learning for Edge Popularity Prediction in Privacy-Preserving Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Concretely, in individual UE, a moderate-scale recurrent neural network (RNN) is prepared and trained on the local request history alone. The RNN in each UE is designed as an AE, with each neuron being an LSTM cell to capture the contextual information hidden in the input data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. Since the MSE loss of an AE is directly obtained by comparing the input and output, the troublesome training data labeling is circumvented. Then, the collaborative prediction is performed under an FL framework, where the distributed UEs periodically exchange their diverse model parameters, rather than the raw private data, with the MEC server to collectively train a global model. Note that the MEC server only needs to deploy an encoder module. We next elaborate on each key element in the designed framework.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Because of the non-i.i.d. user behaviors considered in this paper, the convergence of the LSTM-AE model on each local UE is inconsistent at the end of each communication round. Due to the fact that the convergence of one model can be reflected by its training loss, we therefore design a FedLWA parameter aggregation scheme on the basis of the proposed URFL algorithm to reduce the impacts of non-i.i.d. user behaviors. The URFL algorithm that applies the FedLWA-based parameter aggregation scheme is named FedLWA-based URFL algorithm. Concretely, the parameters passing during the training of the FedLWA-based URFL algorithm is basically identical to that of the URFL algorithm, except that each local user needs to additionally upload

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS5.p1.8" class="ltx_p">Finally, we investigate the time complexity of the proposed URFL algorithm from the perspective of local side and global side. Note that each UE holds local model with the same structure and executes the algorithm in parallel, thus the time complexity of the algorithm at the local side can be analysed from the local model on a single UE. Moreover, we can observe from Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-B2 Distributed Training via FL ‣ IV-B Methodology ‣ IV URFL FOR EDGE POPULARITY PREDICTION ‣ Unsupervised Recurrent Federated Learning for Edge Popularity Prediction in Privacy-Preserving Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Algorithm <a href="#alg3" title="Algorithm 3 ‣ IV-B3 FedLWA for parameter aggregation ‣ IV-B Methodology ‣ IV URFL FOR EDGE POPULARITY PREDICTION ‣ Unsupervised Recurrent Federated Learning for Edge Popularity Prediction in Privacy-Preserving Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that the whole structure of the LSTM-AE model participates in the training while only the encoder component of the LSTM-AE model participates in the online prediction.

The remarkable gain suggests that the proposed method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy while grantee the data privacy of users since it only aggregates the model parameters of each user rather than the private raw data. We argue that the aggregation process of the global prediction model pushes the MEC server to deeply and accurately learn the underlying features from all the UEs towards its coverage. In contrast, the baseline methods not only need to be supplied by large amounts of private data but also are incompetent to exact features from a mass of historical requests kneaded together in time and space.

The reason is that the proposed FedLWA scheme can adaptively weigh the contribution of each local parameter to the global parameter on the basis of the convergence of local models at the end of each communication round, so as to obtain better aggregated parameters. Consequently, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ V-B Results and Discussions ‣ V NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ‣ Unsupervised Recurrent Federated Learning for Edge Popularity Prediction in Privacy-Preserving Mobile Edge Computing Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>(b), the FedLWA-based URFL approach is superior to the URFL approach in terms of the prediction errors at both local user and MEC server sides. Hence, the non-i.i.d. problems in the investigated scenario could be alleviated by applying the proposed FedLWA parameter aggregation scheme.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we investigated the problem of edge popularity prediction in a MEC-enabled privacy-sensitive IIoT system. The concepts of local popularity and global popularities are introduced and we reformulate the underlying distributed history-inaccessible time series forecasting problem as a label-absent distributed learning problem. The dynamic temporal dependencies within the long sequence are explored using LSTM cells and the training data labeling is circumvented by incorporating the AE structure. To realize collaborative prediction, the FL framework is adopted to effectively exchange the diverse model parameters of each network participant with a data-security guarantee. The above modules and designs collectively constitute a novel URFL algorithm, which achieves superior performance in terms of RMSE prediction error and AE loss while avoids privacy disclosure. Our future work will concentrate on the popularity prediction-assisted proactive caching, as well as more complicated scenarios such as the heterogeneous multiple MEC nodes and non-i.i.d. user behaviors.</p>
