<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The burgeoning of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the fifth generation mobile communication (5G) technology are driving the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE). Smartphones, wearable devices, smart homes, and various distributed wireless sensors generate massive amounts of data in real time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which can be used by machine learning techniques to bring diverse artificial intelligence (AI) services to people <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, traditional machine learning is based on centralized training that requires sending all raw data to servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which can drain the wireless bandwidth and cause long communication delays. In addition, with the increasing public concern about data security and privacy issues, people or companies are not willing to share their private data, which leads to the problem of data islands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. To address the aforementioned issues, a promising distributed machine learning framework called federated learning (FL) has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. A typical FL consists of a server and multiple clients with computation capabilities, in which the server only aggregates local models trained at the client side to obtain the global model. By decentralizing model training to the client side, FL not only preserves the data privacy, but also uses the computation capabilities of clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL always assumes synchronous client-server communication, where the server waits to receive all local models of clients for model aggregation. However, with limited bandwidth (computation) resources, some clients may suffer from high communication (computation) latency and thus slow down convergence rate of the whole system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This is known as <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stragglers</em>. Asynchronous FL can naturally solve the stragglers issue, where the server aggregates local models without waiting for the delayed clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. However, discarding stragglers in asynchronous FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> will cause serious performance degradation. Specifically, on the one hand, if stragglers do not receive the global model broadcast by the server due to network failure (e.g., channel fading), they cannot perform local training and communicate with the server. Thus stragglers not only violate participation fairness but also may drift the global model towards local optimum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, the gradients of stragglers based on the stale global model may also degrade the model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. To solve this problem, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> propose a scheme that clients can keep local model training based on the last received global model and send the updated local model to the server at arbitrary time. In this paper, we consider this asynchronous FL scenario in wireless networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As the synchronous case, the asynchronous FL also faces energy-efficiency problem in wireless networks, as mobile clients are usually with limited battery capacity while the transmission of local models is significant energy consuming. In addition, over-participation of some clients may hurt the model performance, i.e., too much participation of a certain group of clients may “drift” the global model to local optimum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, increasing the client participants could improve the model convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. This problem is known as the <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">client selection</em> that is used as an important method to deal with energy efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, i.e., selecting the clients with the most informativeness and/or the least communication overhead to participate in training. Note that client selection is more difficult in considered asynchronous FL with continuous local training and arbitrary communication. Specifically, in traditional (both synchronous and asynchronous) FL, client selection is performed regularly at the beginning of each round, and clients are selected to participate in training in a deterministic way, i.e., the server gathers the network information to calculate the selection or scheduling policy and then selects clients centrally. Whereas, in considered asynchronous FL, where clients can send their updated local models to server at arbitrary times, every client can be selected by a probability at each time. In other words, the server only calculates the selection probability for clients, and each client autonomously decides whether to send updated local model to server based on its selection probability. This refers to as <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">probabilistic client selection</em> in this paper. However, how to use probabilistic client selection to handle energy efficiency and data heterogeneity has no attention.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several useful insights are obtained via our analysis: First, more frequent client-server communication can accelerate the model convergence. Second, fair participation of clients can also improve the model performance. Third, more clients benefit model performance, but if the number of clients exceed a certain threshold, the model performance degrades due to data heterogeneity. Fourth, the proposed scheme not only enhances both model performance and energy efficiency, but also improves fairness of energy consumption among clients.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Wireless resource allocation and client selection for synchronous FL has been extensively studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, with the goal of achieving higher model accuracy or lower energy/latency cost with limited resources. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> consider joint client selection and bandwidth allocation to maximize the model accuracy obtained in a limited training time. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> show that selecting more clients at the end of training phase is beneficial for model accuracy improvement, and then propose an energy-aware client selection and bandwidth allocation algorithm. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> consider an over-the-air FL with dynamic client selection to minimize the convergence bound while meeting energy constraints. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the maximum model accuracy is achieved by weighting local updates for global parameter aggregation under a given resource budget. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, an age-based selection policy is proposed to jointly consider the staleness of the received parameters and the instantaneous channel qualities. Furthermore, client selection based on data importance has been employed to optimize the performance of FL in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Specifically, the importance metric of data in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> incorporates both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data uncertainty. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> utilizes gradient divergence to quantify the importance of each local update. And in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, the importance of data is quantified by calculating the inner product between each local gradient and the ground-truth global gradient. In addition, client selection with the consideration of fairness is studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, where the probability of selecting each client is ensured by introducing a fairness constraint.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Asynchronous FL has been extensively studied to address the stragglers issue. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> the local updates uploaded by clients are adaptively weighted based on their staleness, aiming to alleviate the impact of stragglers on model performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the number of local epochs is dynamically adjusted with the estimation of staleness to improve the model convergence. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, a dynamic learning strategy for step size adaptation on local training is proposed to reduce the impact of staleness caused by stragglers. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, an asynchronous version of local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is studied, wherein the clients can communicate with the server at arbitrary time intervals.
The above asynchronous FL works do not consider wireless networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are some researches on asynchronous FL over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
For example, The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> propose three client selection strategies that maximize the expected number of effective training samples. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, a semi-asynchronous FL is proposed to minimize the training completion time, where the server aggregates local models based on their arrival order.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, an adaptive client selection algorithm is proposed to minimize training latency while taking into account the client availability and long-term fairness.
The staleness of local models and the delays of local model training and uploading are considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
However, the works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> assume that the fixed number of clients are scheduled for aggregation. And in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, stragglers are discarded if they cannot transmit within a period. Unlike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, in our paper, clients probabilistically participate in the training and independently decide whether to upload their local updates.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is necessary to compare our paper with the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> which considers the same asynchronous FL scenario of continuous local updates and arbitrary communication. First, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> focuses on convergence analysis based on the assumption that all clients communicate with the server at the same frequency, while our paper gets away from this impractical assumption and obtains the new results. Second, our paper focuses on client selection and bandwidth allocation, which are not considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. To sum up, our paper and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> consider the same asynchronous FL scenario but different assumptions and focuses, thus the two works are fundamentally different.</p>

From Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-D Adaptability to Varying Network Conditions ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Asynchronous Wireless Federated Learning with Probabilistic Client Selection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, we can observe that the greedy scheme selects the extremely distributed clients multiple times in Scenario 1, while in Scenario 2, extremely distributed clients are completely ignored, indicating that the greedy scheme will only naively select the clients with good channel conditions, thus resulting in unfair client participation and making the global model drift towards local optimum.
In contrast, the total energy consumption of each client in the proposed scheme is more balanced and similar to the random scheme and the age-based scheme in fairness. Meanwhile, since the proposed scheme involves channel-aware client selection, the per-client total energy consumption of the proposed scheme is much lower than that of the random scheme.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied asynchronous FL over wireless networks by joint probabilistic client selection and bandwidth allocation. A bound of convergence rate for asynchronous FL with probabilistic client selection was derived. Then, a joint optimization problem of probabilistic client selection and bandwidth allocation was formulated to trade off the convergence performance of the asynchronous FL and energy consumption of the clients. We proposed an iterative algorithm to find the globally optimal solution of the non-convex problem. Comprehensive experiments showed that the proposed scheme can improve both model convergence and energy efficiency.</p>
