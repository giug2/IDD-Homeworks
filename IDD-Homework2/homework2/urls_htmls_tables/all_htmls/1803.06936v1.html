<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, visual question answering (VQA) has become topical. The premise of VQA’s significance as a benchmark in AI, is that both the image and textual question need to be well understood and mutually grounded in order to infer the correct answer. However, current VQA models perhaps ‘understand’ less than initially hoped, and instead master the easier task of exploiting cues given away in the question and biases in the answer distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In this paper we propose the inverse problem of VQA (iVQA). The iVQA task is to generate a question that corresponds to a given image and answer pair. We propose a variational iVQA model that can generate diverse, grammatically correct and content correlated questions that match the given answer. Based on this model, we show that iVQA is an interesting benchmark for visuo-linguistic understanding, and a more challenging alternative to VQA
because an iVQA model needs to understand the image better to be successful.
As a second contribution, we show how to use iVQA in a novel reinforcement learning framework to diagnose any existing VQA model by way of exposing its belief set: the set of question-answer pairs that the VQA model would predict true for a given image. This provides a completely new window into what VQA models ‘believe’ about images. We show that existing VQA models have more erroneous beliefs than previously thought, revealing their intrinsic weaknesses. Suggestions are then made on how to address these weaknesses going forward.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As conventional object detection and recognition approach solved problems, we see a surge of interest in more challenging problems that should require greater ‘understanding’ from computer vision systems. Image captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, visual question answering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, natural language object retrieval <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and ‘visual Turing tests’ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> provide multi-modal AI challenges that are expected to require rich visual and linguistic understanding, as well as knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities. As interest in these grand challenges has grown, so has scrutiny of the benchmarks and models that appear to solve them. Are we making progress towards these challenges, or are good results the latest incarnation of horses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and Potemkin villages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, with neural networks finding unexpected correlates that provide shortcuts to give away the answer?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent analyses of VQA models and benchmarks have found that the reported VQA success is largely due to exploiting dataset biases and cues given away in the question, with predictions being minimally dependent on understanding image content <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. For example it turns out that existing VQA models do not ‘look’ in the same places as humans do to answer the question <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>; they do not give different answers when the same question is asked of different images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>; and they can perform “well” given no image at all <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Moreover, VQA model predictions do not depend on more than the first few words of the question <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and their success depends largely on being able to exploit label bias <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These observations have motivated renewed attempts to devise more rigorous VQA benchmarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we explore the concept of inverse visual question answering (iVQA). The iVQA task is to input an image-answer pair, and then ask (output) a suitable question for which the given answer holds in the context of the given image. An illustration is shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We explore two applications of the proposed iVQA task: Firstly, iVQA provides a new benchmark for testing multi-modal understanding which is more robust to ‘gaming’ than conventional VQA. Secondly, we show how iVQA can be used as a tool to diagnose and evaluate existing VQA models.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A New Multimodal Intelligence Benchmark</span>  iVQA provides a distinct and interesting benchmark for multi-modal intelligence. This is because: (i) There may be less scope for an iVQA model to cheat through question bias than for VQA to score highly through answer bias (there is less question bias, and exploiting it is harder than for categorical answers) and (ii) The input answers themselves provide a very sparse cue in iVQA compared to questions in VQA. So there may be less opportunity to deduce the question from the answer alone in iVQA than there is to deduce the answer from the question alone in VQA. Thus succeeding at iVQA more clearly requires actual understanding of image content.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A VQA Diagnosis and Evaluation Tool</span>  The standard approach to evaluating VQA has universally been to find out how well VQA models
predict the ground-truth answers of a set of pre-provided questions. This is a useful first step but, due to the closed-world assumption of this evaluation, we cannot validate the rationality of these models more comprehensively without the restrictions imposed by the available question-answer annotations for a given image. In this work, we show how questions generated by our iVQA model can be used to expose the ‘belief set’ of any given VQA model, which consists of all the Q-A pairs that the VQA model would predict for a given image, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. This provides a completely new window ‘under the hood’ of existing VQA models which allows us to understand how they are succeeding and failing to generalise. In particular, it allows us to <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">diagnose</em> them by inspecting their belief sets for erroneous beliefs. This allows us to understand the specific weaknesses of different existing VQA models, and shows that existing VQA datasets are still inadequate (e.g., even models that score highly on the latest VQA datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> are full of erroneous beliefs).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">By examining the beliefs of existing VQA models discovered by our approach, and comparing them to the annotations in the benchmark datasets, we find that newly discovered beliefs broadly fall into four categories: ‘complementary’ – true facts about an image that were not annotated during training, ‘rephrasing’ – questions that are differently phrased versions of those annotated during training, ‘irrelevant’ – image-irrelevant question and answer pairs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and ‘adversarial’ – image relevant questions for which the model believes the wrong answer. Counting the number of beliefs in each category provides a new way to evaluate VQA models’ generalisation in a more open-ended way than existing closed-world benchmarks.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To satisfy both the above objectives, we propose a variational auto-encoder (VAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> based iVQA model which includes randomness in question generation to produce diverse image+answer-conditional visual questions. For model diagnosis by belief-set computation, we further design a reinforcement learning (RL) based paradigm to generate visual questions that are tailored to a specific VQA model. The RL training is driven by a carefully designed reward scheme, where linguistic legality, uniqueness, and goal orientation are optimised to drive the policy evolution.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) The novel iVQA problem is introduced as an alternative benchmark of high-level multi-modal visuo-linguistic understanding. (2) A variational auto-encoder based iVQA model is proposed to generate diverse but image-answer-conditional visual questions. (3) We extend the iVQA model with RL training to intuitively diagnose and analyse VQA models via belief set generation. (4)
We use the proposed belief-set generation approach to better evaluate VQA Models by observing the successes and failures of generalisation in visuo-linguistic understanding. (5) By combining belief sets of a number of state-of-the-arts VQA models, we contribute an extremely challenging VQA dataset upon which all existing VQA models tend to perform poorly, in order to complement existing VQA datasets.</p>

It encompasses a number of classic vision capabilities as prerequisites including object <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and action <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> recognition, attribute description <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and relationship inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. It further requires natural language generation capabilities to synthesise open-ended linguistic descriptions. Popular benchmarks and competitions have inspired intensive research in this area. Captioning models have explicitly addressed these sub-tasks to varying degrees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, but the most common and successful approaches use neural encoders (of images), and decoders (of captions), with little explicit knowledge representation and reasoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The iVQA task investigated here is related to captioning in that we aim to produce natural language outputs, but distinct in that the outputs are sharply conditioned on the required answer, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VQA Challenge</span> Like captioning, VQA has gained attention as a synthesis challenge in AI, requiring both computer vision and natural language understanding to succeed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Given an image, and a natural language question about the image, a VQA system produces an answer. Unlike other vision tasks (recognition, detection, description), the question to be answered in VQA is dynamically specified at runtime. Besides visuo-linguistic grounding, many VQA examples seem to require extra information not contained in the question or image, <em id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span>, background common sense about the world. Thus VQA is hoped to provide a long term goal for AI-complete multi-modal intelligence. However increasing scrutiny has shown that learning systems excel at finding shortcuts in terms of gaming the biases in answer distributions, and giveaway correlations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, leading to doubts about the level of visuo-linguistic intelligence implied by current results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Although some benchmarks in principle require open-sentence answers, most answers are simple one-word outputs, and therefore the most common approach has been to formalise answer generation as a multi-class classification problem over the most frequent answers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Although successful, this is somewhat unsatisfactory as it is no longer an open-world challenge. In this paper we explore iVQA as a novel alternative open-world benchmark for visuo-linguistic understanding.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VQA Models</span> Existing VQA models are typically based on two-branch neural networks: a CNN image encoder and LSTM question encoder, which are merged before feeding to an answer decoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Recently they have been enhanced through various means including better visuo-linguistic merging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, varying degrees of explicit representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, reasoning with external knowledge bases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and improving visual encoding through attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. With most recent models treating answer generation as a classification problem, these models cannot be directly modified for iVQA by simply swapping the answer and question encoder/decoder. Moreover, VQA is closed-world in the sense that there is usually exactly one right answer for a given question, while iVQA is open-world in the sense that there are often multiple questions that have the same answer in one image. Our VAE-based solution addresses this property of the problem.</p>

The most relevant analysis to ours is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, which analyses the behaviours of VQA models by measuring the saliency of different parts of the inputs, <em id="S2.p4.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S2.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text"></span>, words in the question, pixels in the image.

Introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, VQG is further studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> where DenseCap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> is used to generate region specific descriptions before being translated into questions, while Jain <em id="S2.p6.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed a VAE-based VQG model to improve question diversity. The iVQA models we propose are related to the VQG model in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> that both are VAE variants; however, they differ significantly in that our model uses answer as condition. VQG is a pre-specified task unlike VQA and iVQA which are dynamically determined at runtime. Importantly, VQG is easier in terms of required understanding. Since VQG is not required to be answer-conditional, it often generates very general open questions that even humans cannot answer. It does not need to understand the image clearly enough – and ground the two domains richly enough – to correctly condition the generated question on the answer. Another relevant challenge is <span id="S2.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">visually grounded conversation</span> (VGC) which aims to generate natural-sounding conversations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. VGC typically starts with VQG, but the following responses and further questions are generated primarily following conversational patterns mined from social media textual data, and only loosely grounded on the image content as context. In contrast, the grounding on image content in much tighter in iVQA.</p>

<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Neural Network Visualisation</span> Visualisation of neural networks has advanced greatly in recent years. Early approaches just found patches in dataset that maximise the activation of the corresponding neuron <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Zeiler <em id="S2.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> apply an additional deconvoluational operation on the patches for clear visualisation. Another type of approach is gradient-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, which visualises a neuron’s preference starting from a randomly initialised patch. It iteratively updates the patch via gradient ascent under some regularisation. This idea is related to ours in that both maximise the score of a neuron by sample generation, but we learn a policy to generate sentences rather than generating image patches.</p>

<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Adversarial Sample Analysis</span> Besides visualising deep networks to understand them, another direction is to attack deep models by discovering adversarial samples. Szegedy <em id="S2.p8.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> found that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial samples, where slightly perturbed inputs could be misclassified. This was further extended in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, which proposed a gradient based method for efficient adversarial sample generation. Adversarial samples have also been found for recurrent neural networks. Papernot <em id="S2.p8.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S2.p8.1.5" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> adapt this method to sequential inputs, where some words in a sequence are replaced according to the gradients. Our work differs from these in that entirely new sentences are generated to maximise the VQA model score instead of just perturbing the original sentences.</p>

<p id="S2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">A preliminary version of this work was published in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Compared with the earlier study, there are several key differences:
<span id="S2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text">(i) In this study, we focus on the one-to-many mapping problem of iVQA, and proposed a variational iVQA model. It adopts a variational auto-encoder based framework, and introduces latent vectors to handle the uncertainty in questions, while the model in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> mainly focuses on visual attention and ignores the uncertainty problem.
(ii) We propose in this work a new concept of belief set, which is a set of question-answer pairs a VQA model believes to hold for a particular image, enabling us to actually see what a model believes. It is empowered by the reinforcement learning based training paradigm introduced in this study. The VQA model diagnosis ability of iVQA has not been considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.
(iii) Based on belief set extraction, we are able to provide novel means of evaluating existing VQA models and datasets, and draw useful insights from the evaluation results. In contrast, iVQA was not considered as an evaluation tool for VQA in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.<span id="S2.p9.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

Given an (image, question, answer) tuple, we use the ground-truth question as the reference and compare the generated question based on the given image and answer. The similarity between the machine generated questions and the reference questions can be measured by these metrics. Even though generating humanlike questions is relatively easy, doing so in a correct image+answer conditional way to get a high score is challenging, since the model has to capture all the semantic concepts and high-order interactions.</p>

If one of the correct (ground truth) questions is ranked the highest then this image-answer pair is regard as correct at Rank-1. In this way, accuracy over a testing set can be computed as the percentage of the times that correct questions are ranked at the top (denoted Acc.@1). Similarly, we can measure cumulative ranking accuracy at other ranks, e.g., Acc.@3 measures the percentage of times correct questions are ranked in top 3. This means that a model is not as severely penalised if it ranks the ground-truth questions highly, but its generated top ranked question is a novel (but potentially still correct) question.
This metric is related to the multiple-choice setting of VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However we can use it to reveal insights about model strengths and weaknesses by making specific choices of candidate questions in the pool.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Human study</span>  iVQA is open-ended and one-to-many in that there can be many correct questions for one image and answer. Therefore, given an image and an answer, the correct questions may not be annotated exhaustively. The proposed ranking metric computed on the selected question pool alleviates the issue of comparing open-ended questions generated by an iVQA model to a fixed ground-truth set. However, it does not measure directly how ‘correct’ the generated questions are, when they differ from the human annotations originally provided. To evaluate iVQA in a way that awards ‘credit’ for correct questions that are not annotated originally, we perform a human evaluation study. Image-answer pairs are randomly selected from the test set, and annotators assess the generated questions, scoring them from 0 (complete nonsense) to 4 (perfect). The mean score is used as the metric.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Overall</span>  In the first experiment we report the overall iVQA performance on the test split. The results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 4.2 Baseline models ‣ 4 Experiments on iVQA Benchmarking ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> with both the standard linguistic metrics, as well as our ranking accuracy metric. From the table, we can make the following observations: (i) Unlike VQA the margin between the no-image case (A), and the full model (Ours) is dramatic. The ranking accuracies are more than doubled, and the language metrics show similarly striking improvements. This demonstrates that unlike conventional VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the ‘V’ does matter in iVQA.
(ii) The margin between the image + answer type (I+AT) and image-only (I) setting exists, but is not too significant. This shows that while it is a useful hint for an iVQA model to know the question type, it still really needs the actual semantic answer to generate the right questions. E.g., rather than just knowing that it was counting something (answer type), the model does need to know <em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">how many objects were counted</em> (answer) in order to generate the right question specifying what object type needs to be counted – as there may be other objects that could be counted.
(iii) The margins between the (I) and (I+AT) cases and the full model are also striking. This demonstrates that as a test of multi-modal intelligence, iVQA reassuringly requires both modalities in order to do well.
(iv) VQG+VQA indeed performs better than the vanilla VQG model by making the generated question more answer conditional, but it is still weaker than the captioning adapted models (NN and SAT) or ours. The reason is that due to the language bias, it is difficult for the VQA model to identify the right question from multiple candidates where the same answer applies.
(v) The captioning adapted models (NN and SAT) perform well, but are still inferior to the proposed model which is specifically designed for iVQA.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Human Study</span>  The human study is applied on a subset of 300 samples, and evaluates the models in a way that is fully robust to open-ended question generation. Results in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 4.2 Baseline models ‣ 4 Experiments on iVQA Benchmarking ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> show that (i) our model performs the best among all competitors; (ii) the human study scores are highly correlated with the proposed ranking metric. Specifically, the Pearson correlation coefficient between manually labelled scores and the proposed acc@1 and acc@3 metrics are 0.917 and 0.981 respectively, while the best performing linguistic measure (CIDEr) only reaches 0.898. Thus our ranking metric is a reasonably accurate yet cost-effective alternative to the more expensive human evaluation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Qualitative Results</span>  Examples of questions generated by our model are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.2 Baseline models ‣ 4 Experiments on iVQA Benchmarking ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The results illustrate a few interesting points: (i) The generated questions are highly conditional on both images and answers. Particularly, the same answers generate different questions for different images, unlike in VQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>; and the same images generate very different questions when paired with different answers, showing richer reasoning than in VQG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. (ii) Unlike VQA, there are multiple reasonable questions that correspond to one image-answer pair. This is both due to alternative phrasing of the same question (‘<em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">where is the bear sitting?</em>’,’<em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">where is the teddy bear?</em>’,‘<em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">where is the teddy bear sitting?</em>’), as well as multiple semantically distinct questions having the same answer (e.g., ‘<em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">are the children happy?</em>’,‘<em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">is it daytime?</em>’,‘<em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">is it a sunny day?</em>’). Since the annotation is not exhaustive, standard linguistic metrics could be misleading: the generated questions can be correct but unannotated in the dataset. Our proposed ranking metric is more robust to this, as models are only scored according to how plausibly they rate the true question, rather than whether their open-world estimate of the question matches annotated ground-truth. Our human study evaluates the methods in a way that credits open-world question generation. The open-ended question generation formulation of our variational iVQA model means it is straightforward to <em id="S4.SS3.p3.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sample</em> the distribution over questions given images and answers, in order to explore the model’s beliefs – a capability which we will exploit in the next section.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Analysis by Failure Type</span> 
The proposed new evaluation metric enables us to understand the mistakes each model makes. The results in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Baseline models ‣ 4 Experiments on iVQA Benchmarking ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> show the Rank-1 predictions of each model (highest scoring question) broken down according to the category of that prediction. It again shows the superior performance of our iVQA model (ours): 30.81% of the top ranked predictions are correct, which almost doubles that of the VQA model (16.4%). But the main objective here is to analyse which distractor types are mistakenly ranked highly:
(i) Without being able to condition on the answers, the image-only method (I) makes predictions dominated by contrastive (CT) distractor questions taken from similar looking images.
(ii) The answer-only (A) and image+answer type (I+AT) methods make predictions that are dominated by distractor questions of the popular (PP) type. This confirms that these models rely on the unconditional distribution of label statistics in order to solve iVQA.
(iii) The VQA-based baseline instead is dominated by answer-related (RN) distractor. This suggests that the VQA model fails to correctly take into account image context (the ‘V’ is not being accounted for <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>), and is simply picking any question that generates the corresponding answer independently of the required contingency of the answer on the image context.
(iv) The nearest neighbour (NN) approach performs well and has an evenly distributed set of error types, but it is weaker than the proposed in correctly capturing the visual and answer conditions. It is reflected on the larger portion of CT and RN errors.
(v) Our full model <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text">(ours)<span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.2.1" class="ltx_text"> has the largest fraction of correct predictions and manage to suppress the plausible (PS) and contrastive (CT) errors. However it still makes mistakes ranking some popular (PP) questions at the top. This suggests that PP is a challenging distractor type and there is still some overfitting to the biased question distribution in the dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</span></span></p>

Two of the main kinds of bias that a VQA/iVQA model could use to cheat the benchmark are the output <em id="S4.SS3.p5.1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Prior bias</em> (Ignore both inputs and predict only the most likely answer on VQA; use question frequency in iVQA), and <em id="S4.SS3.p5.1.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Language bias</em> (ignore the image and use only the input – question for VQA, answer for iVQA – to predict the output). A good multimodal intelligence benchmark should require understanding and mutual grounding of both modalities, and should be hard to game by exploiting those biases. To analyses these issues we compare performance on iVQA and VQA benchmarks using Prior-alone and Language-alone (LSTM Q for VQA and Answer only for iVQA) baselines versus the full multi-modal model in each case (DeeperLSTM+Norm I for VQA, and I+A model for iVQA).
The results in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ 4.3 Results ‣ 4 Experiments on iVQA Benchmarking ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> show that for VQA the bias-based baselines approach the performance of a full multi-modal model much more closely than the corresponding baselines do for iVQA. This suggests that VQA is easier to ‘game’ (achieve an apparently high score without any image understanding or multimodal grounding), compared to iVQA. Thus we propose that iVQA makes a distinct and interesting benchmark for multimodal intelligence.<span id="S4.SS3.p5.1.2.3" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

The belief set of a VQA model is defined as a set of visual question-answer pairs which the model believes to be true in the context of the image <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="I" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">I</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">I</annotation></semantics></math>. The conventional way to evaluate VQA models is to compute their prediction accuracy on a held out testing set of questions and answers. However, this approach is closed-world in the sense that we only know how well the model fits the testing set: which might not be representative of the model’s sanity in practice if the VQA dataset is biased, as they are in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Our belief set based approach is more open-world in that it reveals the set of things that the model believes to be true, whether or not they are annotated in the test set (see Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5 iVQA as a VQA Diagnosis and Evaluation Tool ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>). Examining the questions in belief sets thus provides a novel way to study the strengths and weaknesses of different existing VQA models.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Having a supervised-learned iVQA model is a good starting point for belief set construction – the oracle (human annotator) provides data for training a VQA model by providing a sample of its belief set to train the VQA model. But the oracle may not sample its beliefs uniformly, producing a biased dataset. The behaviour of a real VQA model will be different from the oracle: both in making mistakes and learn from these systematic biases. To visualise and compare existing VQA models we are interested in developing methods to extract the belief set encoded in a given VQA model’s parameters.</p>

The evolution of the policy is determined by the reward. We consider three factors in designing the reward function: goal orientation, diversity, and legality, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5 iVQA as a VQA Diagnosis and Evaluation Tool ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(b). They are combined in a multiplicative way, because goal orientation is meaningful only when diversity and legality preconditions are met. That is:</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Belief set annotation</span>  The first step is to annotate the belief set for interpretation. We aim to categorise the questions into different types. Concretely there are four basic belief types: rephrasing, complementary, adversarial, and irrelevant. <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Rephrasing:</span> Questions that correspond to visual facts already present in the dataset, but phrased in a different manner. <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Complementary:</span> Questions that reflect the image content and also match the given answer, but are not included in the human annotated questions in the VQA training dataset. <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Adversarial:</span> These also do not correspond to visual facts in VQA training questions as in the complementary type, but the given answer is incorrect for these questions. These are mistakes, failures of VQA generalisation. <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Irrelevant:</span> These questions are either false-premise or completely irrelevant to the image or the answer. Examples of the four belief types are shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.4 VQA model evaluation and diagnosis ‣ 5 iVQA as a VQA Diagnosis and Evaluation Tool ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. A good VQA model should have a large portion of rephrasing and complementary beliefs: since rephrasing beliefs reflect robustness to linguistic variability in question phrasing, and complementary beliefs show a model’s generalisation ability and indicate that it indeed understands the image. In contrast, adversarial and irrelevant beliefs reveal the weaknesses of the VQA model, as both are results of incorrect understanding of the visual and/or language inputs.</p>

A larger portion of rephrasing indicates better linguistic understanding and robustness to language perturbation; and larger proportion of complementary questions means generalisation to new visual facts not annotated in the dataset. More importantly, We can also perform qualitative diagnosis by drawing and visualising questions from the belief set to understand the successes and failures of generalisation of each VQA model. Through the incorrect questions, we can understand what mistakes/wrong beliefs the model has and further gain insights into why such mistakes are made, e.g., is it particularly poor at detecting certain visual concepts or understanding certain questions? This could then lead to development of potential remedies.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Implementation Details</span>  Recall that we have two ways to generate potential beliefs: the unconditional (supervised) iVQA approach from Section 3, and the model-conditional (RL) belief set generation approach from Section 5. To more efficiently generate large enough belief sets, we combine the candidate beliefs from both and use the algorithm described in Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="In 5.3 Belief set construction ‣ 5 iVQA as a VQA Diagnosis and Evaluation Tool ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> to generate the true belief sets for each model. We use 100 random noise vectors for each image-answer pair for belief set generation in quantitative analysis to ensure feasibility, and sample 1000 random vectors in qualitative results to visualise diverse questions. We conduct ablation study to show that the proposed RL framework (Sec. <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Training iVQA for VQA belief set extraction ‣ 5 iVQA as a VQA Diagnosis and Evaluation Tool ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>) using all three rewards enables us to efficiently extract the belief set of any given trained VQA model (see the Supplementary Material for details).</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The belief set compositions of different VQA models are summarised in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 6.2.1 Quantitative results ‣ 6.2 Results on VQA model evaluation and diagnosis ‣ 6 Experiments on iVQA Diagnosis ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, from which we can make the following observations:
(1) Complementary and adversarial beliefs are the most common ones in all VQA models. Irrelevant beliefs are ranked the 3rd,  indicating the importance of introducing a rejection mechanism into VQA models. Rephrased questions are the least common, indicating that our question generator extracts novel beliefs and does not just rely on perturbing known facts.
(2) MLB-att with visual attention generalises better than the vanilla VQA model. It has more correct (complementary, rephrase) and fewer incorrect (adversarial, irrelevant) beliefs.
(3) The N2NMN model with explicit reasoning performs similarly to the attention based MLB-att, and their percentages of correct beliefs are almost the same. However, there are some slight differences: The N2NMN model is better at generalising to complementary visual facts but less robust to adversarial beliefs.
(4) We can fix a model (MLB-att) and compare the benefit of training on the more balanced VQA 2.0 dataset (MLB2-att vs. MLB-att). The percentage of correct beliefs increased by <span id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">6.6%<span id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">, due to an increased proportion of complementary beliefs. This indicates that the VQA2.0 trained model recognises some new visual facts which it originally missed when trained on VQA 1.0; and to a decreased proportion of adversarial beliefs – indicating that the VQA2.0-trained model is harder to fool than the original model. This shows that the richer annotation in VQA2.0 is beneficial, however the large outstanding proportion (<span id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">19.8%<span id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">) of adversarial examples in the belief set indicate that the VQA2.0 dataset is still far from being adequate to train a model that does not suffer from many misconceptions. (5) <span id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Finally, we observe a difference in the standard metric (VQA accuracy) vs our metric (correct beliefs): The standard metric ranks N2NMN and MLB-att slightly above MLB2-att, while our metric ranks MLB2-att clearly above the others. We interpret this as the VQA2.0-trained model actually being better, but the VQA1.0 trained models appear to be better under the standard metric due to overfitting to the biases of this dataset<span id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

As there are too many unique visual questions in the belief set to show exhaustively, we select the beliefs to show via two protocols: maximum belief (Fig. <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 6.2.1 Quantitative results ‣ 6.2 Results on VQA model evaluation and diagnosis ‣ 6 Experiments on iVQA Diagnosis ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> Row 1-3) and random (Fig. <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 6.2.1 Quantitative results ‣ 6.2 Results on VQA model evaluation and diagnosis ‣ 6 Experiments on iVQA Diagnosis ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> Row 4). For maximum belief, we select the beliefs with maximum VQA scores and manually remove questions with the same meaning. For the random protocol, we randomly select from the belief sets questions of different confidence intervals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The result shows that the VQA models encode many visual facts about an image other than human annotation. For example, besides ‘landing gear down’, they additionally recognise ‘headlights on’, ’night time’, ‘airports’ <em id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc</em>.<span id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> for the aeroplane image (Row 1). Even though there are mistakes, attention models understand the image better as there are more correct questions in their belief sets. Furthermore, the MLB-attention model performs significantly better than others when trained with VQA 2.0 (MLB2-att), indicating that the rebalancing in VQA 2.0 data helps.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless various weaknesses of the VQA models are also revealed through the diagnosis.
Firstly, semantic structure and common knowledge are poorly represented in the VQA models. For example, an aeroplane cannot be a ‘fighter plane’ and ‘commercial aircraft’ at the same time; places are unlikely to simultaneously be ‘lighthouse’, ‘airport’, ‘parking lot’, ‘bar’ <em id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc</em>.<span id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>; ‘ships’ usually do not co-occur with ‘city’ or ‘sidewalk’. However, all of them simultaneously appear in the belief sets of these VQA models given a particular image and an answer. While this may be due to these kinds of questions being rare in the original training set, these kinds of issues are particularly severe for the N2NMN model indicating that its generalisation is weak.
Secondly, the correlation between the objects in questions and the answer affects the prediction. For example, as shown in the third row of Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 6.2.1 Quantitative results ‣ 6.2 Results on VQA model evaluation and diagnosis ‣ 6 Experiments on iVQA Diagnosis ‣ Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis Tool" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, the false-premise question “what food is in the basket?” achieves a score even higher than the true-premise question “what food is on the tray?”. Strikingly, this happens for every VQA model compared. It indicates that correlation or co-occurrence is over exploited by existing VQA models and thus these models may be making shortcut predictions without fully understanding the image/question. Even re-balancing the data in VQA2.0 is far from fully solving the problem.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From our results, we found that inadequate language modelling, concept relationship reasoning, and dataset bias are the main problems for all VQA models diagnosed using our iVQA model. For example, all models suffers from irrelevant or adversarial questions. These problems have drawn increasing attention and several approaches are proposed to overcome them. One is to better balance the data to reduce bias: Goyal <em id="S6.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>.<span id="S6.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> balance the answer distribution by providing more visual questions for each image, which makes the questions for each topic more balanced thus helping to learn a more reliable model. Explicit reasoning strategies have also been investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. This can be seen as introducing more prior knowledge in VQA architecture design, which achieves higher performance with a fixed amount of annotation. Additional annotations or models of related tasks are used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> to improve the visual module, interpreting VQA as a combination of multiple sub-problems, <em id="S6.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S6.SS4.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text"></span>, object detection, classification, OCR <em id="S6.SS4.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc</em>. All these methods are useful in improving VQA model performance. However, they do not fully address the limitations of VQA models revealed in this study. So we suggest the following directions for future VQA research:</p>

<div id="S6.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Annotation matters</span>  A densely annotated VQA dataset where most visual facts are annotated is needed. Current VQA datasets are too sparse to provide enough supervision to learn a strong visual module, and too biased in their distribution. This is reflected in the large portion of adversarial beliefs. Given that ‘a picture speaks a thousand words’, dense annotation is likely to be very costly. But the ability to reveal model’s belief sets means that active learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> becomes a promising direction to fill the gaps in existing annotations, allowing better models to be trained.</p>

From a training perspective, QRD would enforce a model to reason about the correctness of implied visual facts in the image, which provides an additional task for multi-task training.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have introduced the novel task of inverse VQA as an alternative multi-modal visual intelligence challenge to the popular VQA paradigm. As a multi-modal intelligence benchmark, our analyses suggest that iVQA is appealing in terms of being less game-able via exploiting label-bias, more clearly requiring the mutual grounding and understanding of both visual and linguistic modalities, and naturally providing an open-world prediction setting. We show that iVQA also provides a novel approach to evaluating and diagnosing VQA models and datasets by revealing the belief sets held by a given trained VQA model.</p>
