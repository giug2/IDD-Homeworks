<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising technology for vehicular networks to protect vehicles’ privacy in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Vehicles with limited computation capacity may face a large computational burden associated with FL. Federated edge learning (FEEL) systems are introduced to solve such a problem. In FEEL systems, vehicles adopt the cellular-vehicle to everything (C-V2X) mode 4 to upload encrypted data to road side units’ (RSUs)’ cache queue. Then RSUs train the data transmitted by vehicles, update the locally model hyperparameters and send back results to vehicles, thus vehicles’ computational burden can be released. However, each RSU has limited cache queue. To maintain the stability of cache queue and maximize the accuracy of model, it is essential to select appropriate vehicles to upload data. The vehicle selection method for FEEL systems faces challenges due to the random departure of data from the cache queue caused by the stochastic channel and the different system status of vehicles, such as remaining data amount, transmission delay, packet collision probability and survival ability. This paper proposes a vehicle selection method for FEEL systems that aims to maximize the accuracy of model while keeping the cache queue stable. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other baseline selection methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of the information and communication technology of Internet of Vehicles (IoV), vehicles use on-board sensors to collect data and process them to achieve massive interaction information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which can satisfy the requirements of different vehicular applications, such as intelligent transportation and object identification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, vehicles are often unwilling to send their data to other vehicles, as vehicle data are private, which makes it difficult to fully meet the needs of vehicle applications. Federated learning (FL) can protect vehicle privacy by sending locally trained models instead of raw data among vehicles to solve such problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In particular, each vehicle trains a local model based on its own data, and then the local model is uploaded to the central cloud. After that, the central cloud aggregates the received local models. Therefore, the global model is obtained and can then be sent to the vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. By doing this, an accurate model can be achieved and vehicles’ data can be preserved. The functions for the federated learning can be various, e.g., autonomous driving, location awareness, mobile biometrics, mobile augmented reality, and analysis of sensing signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Vehicles have intensive computing tasks to process, which would consume lots of computation resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, the computational resources of a vehicle depend on the limited energy resources such as gasoline or electric power of the vehicle, thus the computation capability of vehicles are limited. Therefore, a high computational burden would be caused on the vehicles in FL due to vehicles’ limited computation capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Federated edge learning (FEEL) systems are introduced to solve such a problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The FEEL system is a three-tier infrastructure that includes a central cloud, road side units (RSUs) and vehicles. Each RSU is connected with an edge server and has a cache queue. Each vehicle is equipped with a shuffler. Note that in the FEEL system, the RSUs would not harm the users’ privacy by equipping a shuffler in the vehicles, which can encrypt the raw data uploaded by the vehicles in a uniformly random permutation. In the FEEL system, each vehicle uploads the encrypted data to the RSUs, then the RSUs and central cloud adopt the federated learning to train an accurate model while protecting the privacy of vehicles. Specifically, the RSUs train the local model based on the uploaded data. After that, all RSUs send the locally trained model hyperparameters to the central cloud, which aggregates them to get the global model. Then, the central cloud broadcasts the global model to the RSUs for further training. For the FEEL system, the vehicles with limited computation capability are only responsible for uploading data, while the RSUs and central cloud with sufficient computation capability apply the federated learning. Hence, FEEL system can reduce the computational burden on the vehicles while protecting privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Each vehicle adopts the cellular-vehicle to everything (C-V2X) mode 4, which is the key enabling technology for intelligent mobility and autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, to communicate with the RSU. Note that we consider the scenarios that have high requirements for communication range, stability, and latency to satisfy applications with high safety requirements such as autonomous driving, hence we choose C-V2X mode 4 in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Each RSU’s cache queue is limited. The cache queue can become overloaded and unstable if many vehicles upload data. On the other hand, if few vehicles upload data, the cache queue would have insufficient data for training and the accuracy of the model will suffer. In order to maintain queue stability and obtain accurate models, we have to fill the RSU’s cache queue with vehicle data by taking into account the queue capacity and selecting appropriate vehicles to upload data. In the FEEL system, the channel condition is stochastic and RSU sends back results to vehicles only when the channel condition is sufficiently good, thus the data depart the cache queue randomly. Moreover, different vehicles may have different system status including remaining data amount, transmission delay, packet collision probability and survival ability (i.e., duration of staying in a RSU’s communication range), where the packet collision probability is the important metric of C-V2X mode 4. As the status of each vehicle includes several entities, it is difficult to select the appropriate number of vehicles for data uploading considering the random departure of data and different system status. To the best of our knowledge, there are no related works considering the use of FEEL for vehicular scenarios and no related works to improve the accuracy of the model by considering different system status and queue stability for vehicle selection in the C-V2X mode 4 based FEEL system, which motivated us to undertake this work. In fact, compared with the traditional communication methods, C-V2X has the advantages including wider coverage, higher reliability, lower latency, scalability and lower cost.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The duration of a vehicle driving in the communication range of the RSUs is split into equal time intervals. In each time interval, each vehicle in a RSU first calculates the system status including the remaining data amount, transmission delay, packet collision probability and survival ability, then sends the system status to RSU. Afterwards, the RSU selects some vehicles to upload data. In particular, the RSU first determines the number of selected vehicles to avoid overflowing and then identifies which vehicles are selected based on their system status. After vehicles are selected, the selected vehicles will adopt the shuffler to encrypt their raw data in a uniformly random permutation, and forward the encrypted data to the RSU. The forwarded data are stored in the RSU’s cache queue and for the RSU to train the model locally. At the end of the training, the RSU updates the local model. Next, the RSU feedbacks the training results to the corresponding vehicles and discards the training data simultaneously, if the conditions of the channel between the RSU and the selected vehicles are sufficiently good. Otherwise, the data stay in the queue until the conditions of the channel between the RSU and the selected vehicles are sufficiently good. Up to now, the process in the time interval is finished. The above process is repeated until all vehicles in the RSU communication range have no data for uploading. After that, the updated local model at the RSU is uploaded to the central cloud. After the central cloud collects the local models from all RSUs, the local models would be aggregated to update the global model. Finally, the RSUs download the updated global model from the central cloud for the next training. During the above process, the communication between vehicles and RSUs employs C-V2X mode 4.</p>

The priority is defined by the following cases. Some vehicles with a large remaining data amount may not have the opportunity to upload all their data if the vehicles with a small remaining data amount are selected. In addition, the vehicle will upload more data when the transmission delay is low, and the vehicle with a lower packet collision probability is selected to improve successful packet transmission. Moreover, the vehicles with small survival ability are preferred to be selected because they will soon drive out of the RSU’s communication range.

<p id="S6.p1.14" class="ltx_p">In this section, we perform extensive simulation experiments and numerical evaluations to verify the performance of the vehicle selection method by comparing key performance indicators. The simulation is based on Python 3.6 and MATLAB 2019b. Python 3.6 is used to implement the FEEL system for selecting vehicle, while MATLAB 2019b is used to implement the C-V2X Mode 4 communication process. The MATLAB code is realized based on the code in related work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which has been widely adopted by researchers. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the results conducted by MATLAB have been validated by Veins, which is a tool to simulate the real network protocol and environment. Hence, our results can reflect the critical performance metrics of the proposed algorithm. The model training is based on the publicly available MNIST dataset. The simulation scenario is a one-way road covered by multiple RSUs. It is assumed that each RSU in the vehicle network is equipped with a cache queue and covers <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> vehicles, and <math id="S6.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> vehicles driving at the same velocity, where each vehicle carries 1500 bytes of data.

The average packet collision probability is higher when the packet transmission frequency is higher and the number of sub-channels is fewer. This is because the packet collision probability is composed of two parts: the interference probability generated by the interfering vehicles is over the sensing power threshold and the probability that two vehicles transmit simultaneously using the same resource. Given a larger number of vehicles, a higher packet transmission frequency, and a fewer number of sub-channels, the above two probabilities will be increased accordingly, and thus contribute to the increasing packet collision probability.

However, the random selection method does not consider the system status of vehicles in random vehicle selection. As a result, some vehicles became unavailable earlier than our proposed selection method due to insufficient remaining data or insufficient survival ability, resulting in no data available for the RSUs.</p>

We can see that when the static selection method is adopted, the training accuracy is lower than that with other methods. This verifies that if few vehicles upload data, the cache queue would have insufficient data for training and the accuracy of the model will suffer. The observation shows that the training accuracy of our proposed selection method is higher than that of the random selection method and the static selection method from the beginning. From the 600th time interval, the accuracy curves of the three selection methods gradually overlap. This is because our proposed selection method takes into account the system status of vehicles, which makes more vehicles participate in the federated training, and thus improves the training accuracy as compared to two other selection methods. In the 600th time interval, because the training contains enough data, all three selection methods start to converge. In addition, our proposed selection method does not end the training until the 1100th time interval because it considers the heterogeneous system characteristics of the vehicles, while the random selection method ends the training at the 970th time interval. Moreover, the static selection method selects a few vehicles to upload data in each time interval. Therefore, after the other two selection methods have finished their training, the static selection method can still select vehicles because there are still candidate vehicles in the communication range of the RSU. Therefore, the static selection method can be trained for a longer time until the maximum time interval is reached, but it can only select a few vehicles to upload data in each time interval. Although the position-based selection method has higher training accuracy and converges faster than other methods, its queue backlog exceeds the queue’s maximum length early, making the cache queue unstable. This is because the position-based selection method selects too many vehicles with the closest distance to the RSU in each time interval.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a vehicle selection method to maximize the accuracy of the model and maintain the cache queue stability for the FEEL systems. We first considered the random departure of data and determine the optimal number of selected vehicles to ensure the stability of the cache queue according to Lyapunov’s control theorem. Then, we jointly considered the vehicles with different system status and proposed the vehicle selection method to maximize the accuracy of the model. Our proposed method outperforms other baseline selection methods according to extensive simulation experiments. The conclusions of this paper are listed as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">(1) For the C-V2X mode 4 based FEEL systems, the queue’s backlog keeps stability for more time intervals under the smaller packet transmission frequency and the larger number of sub-channels. When the numbers of vehicles are 100, 150 and 200, the queue’s backlog keeps stability for almost the same time intervals and the kept time intervals are more than that when the number of vehicles is 50.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">(2) Our proposed method experiences more time intervals and uploads more data for model training than other baseline selection methods.</p>

<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">(3) Our proposed method converges faster in model training in terms of accuracy and loss than other baseline selection methods.</p>
