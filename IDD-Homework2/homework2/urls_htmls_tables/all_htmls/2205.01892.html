<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) is a well-known assessment scheme that evaluates the gross motor development of infants by recording the number of specific poses achieved. With the aid of the image-based pose recognition model, the AIMS evaluation procedure can be shortened and automated, providing early diagnosis or indicator of potential developmental disorder. Due to limited public infant-related datasets, many works use the SMIL-based method to generate synthetic infant images for training. However, this domain mismatch between real and synthetic training samples often leads to performance degradation during inference. In this paper, we present a CNN-based model which takes any infant image as input and predicts the coarse and fine-level pose labels. The model consists of an image branch and a pose branch, which respectively generates the coarse-level logits facilitated by the unsupervised domain adaptation and the 3D keypoints using the HRNet with SMPLify optimization. Then the outputs of these branches will be sent into the hierarchical pose recognition module to estimate the fine-level pose labels. We also collect and label a new AIMS dataset, which contains 750 real and 4000 synthetic infants images with AIMS pose labels. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly align the distribution of synthetic and real-world datasets, thus achieving accurate performance on fine-grained infant pose recognition.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Recent medical research suggests that early signs of ASDs may first manifest within the motor control system and present as a motor delay. According to the studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, infants who have delays in acquiring motor skills are at higher risk of developing ASD and may serve as an early indicator of neuro-developmental disorder. To better measure or quantify the level of motor development , Alberta Infants Motor Scale (AIMS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is introduced as a scale assessment procedure to evaluate and track infant motor milestones based on counting the number of gross motor skills that the target can achieve. However, traditional AIMS assessment requires trained professionals to conduct, which are considered time-consuming and inefficient. Moreover, the collection of enough and diversified infant pose images for algorithmic development is challenging due to privacy concerns and institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations. To overcome these issues, a systematic AIMS assessment system, which incorporates the deep learning based 3D infant pose estimation trained by synthetic infant pose data and unsupervised domain adaptation technologies, is proposed to show promising performance for effective AIMS assessment of real-world infant in this paper.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the difficulty in collecting and annotating such fine-grained poses, many datasets collect long untrimmed sequences that lack several distinct poses. Moreover, real-world infant-related data are extremely limited because of privacy concerns and institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations, resulting in most related research on infants using the synthetic datasets for model training. However, one of the problems of training using synthetic data is the domain shift between the synthetic data and real-world data, which often leads to performance degradation and poor generalization ability of the trained model. One attempt to solve such a problem is transferring a model learned on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, known as Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Specifically, we have synthetic infant images with pose labels as the source domain and real-world infant images without labels as the target domain. By using UDA, our final goal is to align the source and target domains in the feature space for further applications.</p>

Ganin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> propose a representative method of distribution matching involving training a domain classifier using the intermediate features and generating the features that deceive the domain classifier. This method utilizes the similar techniques used in generative adversarial networks (GANs). The category classifier is trained to predict the task-specific category labels. And the domain classifier is trained to predict the domain of each input. The two classifiers share feature extraction layers that are trained to predict the label of source samples correctly and deceive the domain classifier. Thus, the distributions of the intermediate features of the target and source samples are made similar. However, an issue of unsupervised domain adaptation by back-propagation is that the target features can be near a task-specific classifier’s boundary, which will cause the target samples far from source ones (ambiguous features) to be likely misclassified after alignment.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy remains one of the issues for infant-related dataset collection process. Therefore, the majority of the existing infant datasets are synthetic images. Currently, there are only limited infant-related datasets: MINI-RGBD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, SyRIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. MINI-RGBD mapped real infant movements to the SMIL model, generating RGB and depth video sequences with 2D and 3D joint coordinates. However, these data are synthesized from infants under seven months old and thus present simple poses with small changes over samples. SyRIP is composed of two portions, real and synthetic. The real part consists of 700 infant images collected from public sources like Youtube and Google, while the synthetic part consists of 1000 images rendered using the SMIL model. The 2D joint coordinates are fully annotated in COCO format <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> for these images, which is a huge contribution toward the infant pose estimation research but lack labels for the pose classification task. Zhou’s dataset contains 5500 synthetic images with 11 classes selected from AIMS, but the insufficient corresponding real-world evaluation portion makes it difficult to justify the model’s generalization ability.</p>

The goal of unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) is to train the CNN classifier that reduces the discrepancy of the two distributions. Specifically, we adopt Local Maximum Mean Discrepancy (LMMD) to aid our UDA on aligning the relevant subdomain distributions of domain specific layer activation across different domains.</p>
