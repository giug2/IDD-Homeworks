<p id="id19.id1" class="ltx_p">Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a popular machine learning paradigm, enabling model training across the data and the task parties with different features about the same user set while preserving data privacy. In production environment, VFL usually involves one task party and one data party. Fair and economically efficient feature trading is crucial to the commercialization of VFL, where the task party is considered as the data consumer who buys the data party’s features. However, current VFL feature trading practices often price the data party’s data as a whole and assume transactions occur prior to the performing VFL. Neglecting the performance gains resulting from traded features may lead to underpayment and overpayment issues. In this study, we propose a bargaining-based feature trading approach in VFL to encourage economically efficient transactions. Our model incorporates performance gain-based pricing, taking into account the revenue-based optimization objectives of both parties. We analyze the proposed bargaining model under perfect and imperfect performance information settings, proving the existence of an equilibrium that optimizes the parties’ objectives. Moreover, we develop performance gain estimation-based bargaining strategies for imperfect performance information scenarios and discuss potential security issues and solutions. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bargaining model.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has become a popular machine learning paradigm for that it allows model training to happen across multiple devices or institutions, <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">aka. </em>clients, while keeping their data localized.
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a subcategory of FL that enables the training of clients’ datasets sharing the data from the same set of users while holding different features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The increasing demand for VFL is evident in recent industrial trends <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">wu2020privacy, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">cheng2021secureboost, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2021secureboost+, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">niknam2020federated, </a>)</cite>. Organizations with limited or fragmented datasets are driven to partner with complementary data sources to amplify the training of machine learning models. Alongside, global concerns about data breaches and privacy violations have amplified the urgency for enhanced security measures. Consequently, a rise in privacy-focused VFL platforms and initiatives has been observed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2021fate, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">xie2023federatedscope, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">he2020fedml, </a>)</cite>. While multi-party VFL is a subject of extensive academic research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022vertical, </a>)</cite>, insight from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology’s (CAICT) White Paper on Federated Learning Scenario Applications<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.caict.ac.cn/kxyj/qwfb/ztbg/202202/P020220222528294962585.pdf" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">http://www.caict.ac.cn/kxyj/qwfb/ztbg/202202/P020220222528294962585.pdf</a> </span></span></span>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">xie2023federatedscope, </a>)</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2021fate, </a>)</cite>, indicates that in practical applications or production environments, VFL is often implemented with a single task party and data party. Specifically, according to the white paper, this 1v1 VFL paradigm has been employed by commercial banks to amalgamate external data when constructing joint anti-fraud models, establish potential insurance users alongside insurance companies, as well as by advertisers to conduct user modeling with data of external media platforms. The commercial relevance and economic impact attributed to this 1v1 VFL model is steadily growing. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the VFL setting characterized by a singular task party and a singular data party.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the current era, data has transformed into a valuable commodity, often considered as goods with specific prices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">pei2021data, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">pei2020survey, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">jia2023research, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">chai2022selective, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">acemoglu2022too, </a>)</cite>. This valuation is prominently seen in digital products, where information serves as both a resource and product, forming the backbone of modern services and technologies. The two key roles in VFL can also be considered as data consumer and the data provider: the “task party”, responsible for labels and performing downstream tasks, and the “data party”, supplying the essential feature data. Current works in VFL mostly concentrate on protecting the security and privacy of data or information transmission between the task party and the data party, ensuring that collaboration occurs without compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the involved parties. However, the intricate aspect of data valuation, which underpins many economic decisions in other contexts, has not been extensively explored or studied.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the current production environment, data trading in VFL is mostly conducted at party level. More specifically, the data party names a price for its feature, and when a task party is paired with it for VFL, the task party buys all features offered by the data party. However, this may lead to undesired outcomes: 1) for the task party, buying all data from the data party, it also pays for features that may not be useful in enhancing model performance, and 2) for the data party, as the utility of the data is contingent upon task parties’ different application scenarios and production environments, it may under-estimate/over-estimate the value of the features. This indiscriminate and one-shot trading of all features between parties highlights the need for a more nuanced and economically efficient approach for feature trading in VFL. Bargaining has proven to be effective in various economic contexts where there are two players <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">nash1950bargaining, </a>)</cite> participated, which permits parties to negotiate and agree upon the value of individual features or combinations of features, resulting in a more flexible and efficient allocation of resources. The iterative process where a party could revisit its offers also encourages the achieving of mutual benefit. Inspired by this, we here propose to introduce bargaining for the feature trading in VFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Bargaining in the context of VFL diverges from traditional data asset markets in several key aspects, and this brings non-trivial challenges. First, in conventional one-to-one bargaining in data markets, the buyer seeks to obtain specific goods, such as datasets, from the seller <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">jia2023research, </a>)</cite>. The participants then negotiate the price of these goods. In contrast, within the setting of VFL, bargaining is result-oriented. For the task party, it targets to maximize the net profit of using the bought feature to perform VFL. For the data party, it aims at pricing the features with their utility considered and maximizing the payment of selling features. As a consequence, the pricing mechanism should take model performance gain into consideration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Second, in conventional one-one bargaining, the information advantage is clearer, <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e., </em>the seller has more information about the value of goods, and, thus is in a better place to take the lead during the game <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">nash1950bargaining, </a>)</cite>. While in VFL market, the value of features is hard to be known in advance to both the data party (seller) and the task party (buyer). This uncertainty arises primarily for two reasons: 1) a newly paired task party and data party have no information about the performance gain that their collaboration could result in until VFL is conducted; and 2) even if the performance gain is known in advance, the data party lacks insights about the task party’s model utility, which is related to the production environment and not revealed since they are proprietary business information belonging to the task party. Therefore, it is important to manage the information on the market and design fair bargaining model accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with these problems, we first define a performance gain related payment function to price the outcome of a VFL course, based on which we formulate the objectives of the participants in the form of revenues. A bargaining model with the key idea that the task party targets a certain performance gain, offering a quoted price to the data party and the data party responds with products, <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e., </em>feature bundles, is proposed. The negotiation process continues until both parties agree on a feature bundle - payment matching (acceptance) or until they are unable to reach an agreement (breakdown). The task party is designated to take the lead during the game because it is more sensitive to the outcome of the VFL, as well as be aware of the budget and utility rate of its model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We analyze the bargaining under perfect performance information and imperfect performance information settings, distinguished by if the performance gain resulting from a feature bundle can be known in advance. The existence of an equilibrium under perfect performance information is proved theoretically. As bargaining is an iterative process with time cost, we further discuss the equilibrium by considering the cost factor. Further, bargaining strategies are established in imperfect performance information setting based on learning-based estimation.</p>

We first analyze bargaining in the perfect information setting, where the the parties have more awareness of each other, and then extend the analysis to imperfect setting. In the perfect information setting, we consider that the two parties know in advance about the performance gain of conducting VFL on each feature bundle of the task party. And for imperfect information, we suppose the performance gain is not known in advance unless VFL is formed after a round of iteration. We assume that in both situations, the objective functions of the parties are known to each other.</p>

This is because the cost revenue is independent of the bargaining result but only a function of the number of rounds. Therefore, the task party and the data party continue seeking to maximize the obtained revenue during a specific round of bargaining. However, as the bargaining cost monotonically increases to bargaining rounds, late-reached agreements can lead to the situation that the increased revenue does not cover the increased cost of bargaining, which makes the continuation of bargaining not necessary. In this case, the player would tend to reach the optimal solution as early as possible and terminate the negotiation when it is not worth continuing.</p>

It is important to simultaneously achieve both effective bargaining and effective training. Second, <span id="S3.SS5.SSS1.p4.8.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">simultaneous update</span>. Once a task party and a data party are paired for VFL, they both need to train their estimation functions so as to fit the current partner. Such a simultaneous training can introduce dynamics and may lead to convergence problems if there is no mutual understanding shared. To solve these problems, we propose the following offer-generating strategies on the side of the data party and the task party.</p>

Note that for the task party, the performance gain estimation function takes effect on price offer generating stage, while the termination conditions are based on the calculated real performance gain after receiving feature bundle and performing VFL. Moreover, despite in the setting of imperfect performance information, the task party lacks prior knowledge of the potential range of performance gains that could be offered by the data party, the practice of targeting a specific performance gain, as done in the case of perfect performance information, becomes still doable by introducing Case II.</p>

<div id="S3.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, there is a risk of malicious participants trying to manipulate the model or extract information from the training process. This risk is especially of concern in the context of VFL as it often requires direct communication between two parties without a server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2022vertical, </a>)</cite>. Consequently, defenses and attacks are widely studied in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">jiang2022comprehensive, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">luo2021feature, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">jin2021cafe, </a>; <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">lyu2022privacy, </a>)</cite>. We here analyze possible threat models of the VFL market from two perspectives: 1) VFL training and inference and 2) the bargaining. <span id="S3.SS6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FL Training and Inference.</span> The proposed VFL market is FL protocol-agnostic since it only takes the output (performance gain) of a VFL course as intermediate information for subsequent bargaining but does not affect and is not affected by the specific training protocol of VFL. This makes it adaptable to any security-related VFL training protocols and does not introduce a new threat model during the training and inference phase. <span id="S3.SS6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Bargaining.</span> As performance gain is exchanged between the two parties, a party can access this information and conduct possible inference attacks on the other party’s data. To eliminate this risk, encryption methods such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">paillier1999public, </a>)</cite> and Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">yao1982protocols, </a>)</cite> can be adopted for multiplication or comparing related operations. As the detailed design of security-preserving approaches is out of the scope of the paper, we omit it here.</p>

For the tree-based models, we consider the two parties together training a Random Forest model, with gini index as the splitting metric. For the DNN-based model, we consider the two parties collaboratively training a 3-layer multi-layer perception (MLP), with embedding dimensions 64 and 32. For the 3-layer MLP, the learning rate is set as 1e-2, and the batch size is set as 128 for the Titanic dataset, and 512 for the Credit dataset and the Adult dataset. In the isolated training of the task party, we set the number of epochs as 200, which ensures convergence. The maximum number of bargaining rounds is set as 500, and the bargaining is considered as terminated with transaction fails if it exceeds the threshold. Other key parameters regarding bargaining are empirically studied in subsequent sections.</p>

It is worth mentioning that the two parties reach agreements faster under the proposed approach compared with the Increase Price method, with a more robust trend, which suggests that targeting the turning point of the payment and net profit function is an effective strategy for reaching equilibrium. Moreover, the Random Bundle method performs poorly in almost all cases, with early terminations that result from unsuccessful transactions. This is due to the fact that feature bundles with low performance gain can be offered by the task party, in which case the task party terminates the bargaining for the violation of Case 4 in Section <a href="#S3.SS4.SSS3" title="3.4.3.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have identified the need for an economically efficient approach to feature trading in VFL and proposed a bargaining-based model to address this issue. Our model incorporates performance gain-based pricing and analyzes the bargaining process under perfect and imperfect performance information settings. We have demonstrated the existence of an equilibrium that optimizes the objectives of both the task party and the data party in perfect performance information setting. Additionally, we extend the result to imperfect performance information scenarios and propose performance gain estimation-based bargaining strategies. We also discuss potential security issues and solutions. Experiments on real-world datasets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed bargaining model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the proposed bargaining model has several limitations. 1) It does not provide protection if the participants manipulate the goods or information when terminate the game. For example, the task party may accept a feature bundle with high performance gain but only report a lower value to reduce its payment. A possible solution for this is to involve of a trustworthy third party for evaluation. 2) The sampling-evaluation based quoted pricing choosing strategy is straightforward but not efficient and the task party can employ automatic bargaining offer strategy, such as learning based, to optimize the efficient of offer generating. Nevertheless, we maintain a positive view of the impact of this paper and hope it serves as a foundational work on FL markets and inspires future research.</p>
