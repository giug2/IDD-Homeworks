<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is an emerging paradigm for decentralized training of machine learning models on distributed clients, without revealing the data to the central server. Most existing works have focused on horizontal or vertical data distributions, where each client possesses different samples with shared features, or each client fully shares only sample indices, respectively. However, the hybrid scheme is much less studied, even though it is much more common in the real world. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generalized algorithm, FedGraph, that introduces a graph convolutional neural network to capture feature-sharing information while learning features from a subset of clients. We also develop a simple but effective clustering algorithm that aggregates features produced by the deep neural networks of each client while preserving data privacy.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional cloud-based machine learning applications operating in multi-client environments, there is an underlying assumption that datasets from various clients can be consolidated and processed on a central server. This approach is aimed at enhancing prediction performance by leveraging the combined data resources. However, this method assumes a level of data sharing and centralization that may not always be feasible or desirable due to data heterogeneity, high communication cost, and data privacy requirement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Recently, to address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new distributed learning paradigm. It enables both homogeneous and heterogeneous clients to collaboratively participate in the learning process without requiring access to their raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The challenge of FL primarily arises from the heterogeneity in datasets. FL is categorized into horizontal FL (HFL), vertical FL (VFL), and hybrid FL (HBFL) based on the form of the heterogeneous data involved as shown in <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hybrid FedGraph: An efficient hybrid federated learning algorithm using graph convolutional neural network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. First, the HFL was proposed to address sample heterogeneity, where clients possess different sample distributions but share common features. This form of FL has received the most attention in research. Most studies have implemented a strategy where both the server and the clients share the same model architecture, due to their shared input space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, VFL is predicated on the assumption of feature heterogeneity. This means that clients may have different, though not necessarily unique, features for the same samples. Consequently, the aim of VFL is to aggregate these diverse features in a manner that preserves privacy. The goal is to collaboratively build models using samples with identical IDs from all participating clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">HBFL integrates the aspects of both HFL and VFL. In this configuration, data across different clients may not have identical feature spaces or sample IDs. A common challenge within the HBFL framework is the scenario where a client holds only a partial set of sample IDs and features. These partial datasets often overlap but are not entirely identical to the data held by other clients. Additionally, compared to a centralized data setting, the datasets in HBFL are typically incomplete, further complicating the learning process. This HBFL setting is prevalent in various domains, such as medicine <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For example, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Hybrid FedGraph: An efficient hybrid federated learning algorithm using graph convolutional neural network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, in a medical diagnosis scenario, clinic A may possess the neurology and orthopedic examination results for patients 1 and 2. In contrast, clinic B has the orthopedic and internal medicine examination results for patients 2 and 3. By utilizing HBFL, these clinics can achieve improved comprehensive diagnostic outcomes for each patient.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its significance and wide applicability in real-world scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, progress in addressing the inherent challenges of non-uniform sample and feature spaces has been limited. Existing machine learning and deep learning techniques have largely overlooked these dual heterogeneities. To the best of our knowledge, there have been only two algorithms that can be applied to HBFL scenarios with numerous clients where deep neural networks (DNNs) are used as baseline models for prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. These algorithms apply a strategy that aggregates the clients’ model parameters to construct the server model, a common technique in HFL. Essentially, this approach of aggregating local models prevents the server from learning meaningful insights that could otherwise be derived from synergistically merging multiple clients’ representations. Thus, we propose a method where the server effectively aggregates multiple clients’ representations to achieve superior prediction results, rather than simply combining clients’ knowledge (model parameters), while ensuring the data privacy of each client. Our approach leverages a graph convolutional network (GCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to aggregate clients’ representations considering feature-sharing information among clients. This use of GCN facilitates the effective integration of available information, ensuring robust prediction performance even in the face of data sparsity in HBFL scenarios.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Horizontal federated learning (HFL)</span> Early studies in FL, have focused on addressing sample heterogeneity, where all clients share the same feature space but have distinct sample spaces. FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> has become the most widely adopted method in HFL, where the server averages the weights of clients’ local neural networks and redistributes the global models back to clients in each round. However, its efficacy diminishes with non-IID data among clients. To address this, several improvements have been proposed. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> introduces a proximal term to the local training objective to enhance training with non-IID data. SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> employs control variates to correct local updates, addressing the unstable and slow convergence of FedAvg in non-IID settings. Conversely, FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposes neuron matching and alignment using Bayesian optimization to improve inference accuracy, particularly focusing on the aggregation of local models. Researchers have also made efforts to reduce communication costs in HFL due to the frequent downloading and uploading of model parameters. Techniques such as client update subsampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and model quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> have been explored to address these challenges.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Vertical federated learning (VFL)</span> Since HFL assumes a shared feature space among multiple clients, it is vital to ensure confidentiality, especially among clients with competing interests <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, in VFL scenarios, collaboration among non-competing organizations/entities with vertically partitioned data is encouraged. The goal is to leverage more extensive or deeper feature dimensions through proper encryption methods, thereby enhancing the global model. Specifically, each client updates its own model locally, and then these updates are aggregated in a manner that preserves privacy. In this way, all parties collaborate to develop a federated model that utilizes global features. Conventionally, most research has focused on developing cross-party, privacy-preserving VFL algorithms based on linear/logistic regression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, matrix factorization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and gradient boosting decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Recently, encryption and aggregation schemes have been incorporated into DNNs in the VFL setting. For example, FATE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, a popular FL library, designed and implemented a VFL-DNN framework by leveraging a hybrid encryption scheme during the forward and backward stages of the VFL training procedure. Castiglia et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a compressed VFL (C-VFL) algorithm for communication-efficient training on vertically partitioned data, where multiple parties collaboratively train a model on their respective features and periodically share compressed intermediate representations. Similarly, Khan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> described a method where vertically partitioned local data are compressed using principal component analysis or an autoencoder before aggregated latent vectors are fed into the final global model.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Hybrid federated learning (HBFL)</span> In HBFL, also termed federated transfer learning or semi-supervised VFL, there is often incomplete sharing of either sample IDs or features. While this hybrid approach is prevalent in real-world scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, research has been comparatively scarce, primarily due to the complexities arising from missing features. Overman et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> developed a hybrid federated dual coordinate ascent (HyFDCA) algorithm tailored for addressing convex problems within the HBFL framework. However, because this algorithm is designed for convex problems, it is unsuitable for training many machine learning models, including DNNs, which are our primary focus. Further expanding the scope, several studies have explored more generalized HBFL settings, not confined to convex problems. Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, for instance, implemented cross-view training (CVT) in their FedCVT framework to infer representations for absent raw features. In this study, the authors assumed an environment where some samples can be shared among clients for CVT, an assumption that may not be generalizable to many real-world scenarios. In a similar vein, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> introduced the hybrid federated matched averaging (HyFEM) algorithm, focusing on optimizing a linear mapping to reconcile dimension mismatches between local client models and the global feature extractor. More recently, Gao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed the HedHD algorithm, which integrates a tracking variable, enabling clients to capture global gradient information and update their models based on local data. These two studies concentrated on aggregating local models. While this method effectively accumulates clients’ knowledge, it falls short in extracting meaningful insights that could be realized through learning multiple clients’ features. In contrast, our study takes a novel approach. We aim to develop a server model that synergistically aggregates feature information from clients, taking into account their feature-sharing information. Additionally, we ensure that there is no information leakage between clients and the server.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we explore privacy protection through two distinct lenses. Initially, we observe that deeper feature extractors often lead to increased input distortion, implying that a higher number of layers may bolster privacy. Subsequently, we introduce a privacy score to quantify the challenge of inferring original inputs. Integrating these perspectives enables us to ascertain the optimal number of hidden layers. The details are provided in Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3 Privacy Score ‣ 3 The Proposed Approach ‣ Hybrid FedGraph: An efficient hybrid federated learning algorithm using graph convolutional neural network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3</span></a>.</p>

This embedding is aggregated on the server to facilitate collaboration with other clients possessing the same sample but with different feature compositions. For the server, we employ a modified version of the GCN as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3.sf3" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 3.2 Modeling Setting ‣ 3 The Proposed Approach ‣ Hybrid FedGraph: An efficient hybrid federated learning algorithm using graph convolutional neural network" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3c</span></a>.

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A challenge arises in clustering because using embedding information is not viable, as it implies the potential leakage of such information. Therefore, we employ a random clustering technique that relies solely on sample IDs. Each individual sample possesses a unique ground truth, shared among the participating clients, which can be utilized during the clustering process. Ultimately, our objective is to develop a random clustering algorithm that effectively supports server training using only sample IDs and ground-truth information. In this way, we can obtain mean embeddings and ground-truth values for each sample group without sharing information about the membership of sample indices for each client.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p3.4" class="ltx_p">In testing phase, the server utilizes the actual embeddings from clients. Therefore, it is crucial that the averaged embeddings, post-clustering, do not significantly deviate from the original embeddings. In classification tasks, to appropriately regulate this perturbation, we randomly cluster samples within the same class as they are more likely to be similar. However, clustering only in-class samples carries a risk of class-specific pattern leakage in both the feature space and the sample space.

To circumvent this issue, we have devised a client-based validation method using the pre-trained bottom model. The validation method is designed based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that a high <math id="S3.SS4.p4.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\delta" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p4.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p4.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p4.3.m3.1.1.cmml">δ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p4.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p4.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p4.3.m3.1.1">𝛿</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p4.3.m3.1c">\delta</annotation></semantics></math> increases the risk of sample index information leakage, as all samples in a cluster may belong to different clients. In other words, if a client’s samples are grouped in a cluster, the client could deduce that another client also possesses these samples. From this perspective, a low <math id="S3.SS4.p4.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\delta" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p4.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p4.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p4.4.m4.1.1.cmml">δ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p4.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p4.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p4.4.m4.1.1">𝛿</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p4.4.m4.1c">\delta</annotation></semantics></math> is preferable. Simultaneously, we assume that the client aims to generate mean embeddings that do not significantly deviate from the actual embeddings. To achieve this, the client retrains the bottom model using mean embeddings and ground-truths after clustering to evaluate performance degradation. A substantial decrease in performance indicates a significant deviation of the mean embeddings. Generally, a low <math id="S3.SS4.p4.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\delta" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p4.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S3.SS4.p4.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p4.5.m5.1.1.cmml">δ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p4.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S3.SS4.p4.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p4.5.m5.1.1">𝛿</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p4.5.m5.1c">\delta</annotation></semantics></math> results in more performance degradation (as will be demonstrated in our experiment results).

This procedure is conducted within the client’s domain. Since the client lacks sample group information, pure random clustering is utilized for this process.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel GCN-based federated learning algorithm applicable to both VFL and HBFL. To enhance privacy protection, we applied partial network embedding and CRC, along with a validation procedure to identify optimal hyperparameters without risking information leakage. We assessed the effectiveness of the proposed CRC within a VFL environment by contrasting it with random clustering and K-means, demonstrating that CRC can significantly improve the performance of our learning algorithm. However, to fully validate the proposed algorithm’s efficacy across various dimensions, further extensive experimentation is necessary, including comparisons with other VFL and HBFL algorithms. Future work will expand on this study by conducting comparative experiments in diverse environments.</p>
