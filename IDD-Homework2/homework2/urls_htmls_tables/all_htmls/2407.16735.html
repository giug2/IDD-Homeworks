<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, recent studies have shown that it is vulnerable to various privacy attacks, such as data reconstruction attacks. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of privacy leakage in federated learning from two perspectives: linear algebra and optimization theory. From the linear algebra perspective, we prove that when the Jacobian matrix of the batch data is not full rank, there exist different batches of data that produce the same model update, thereby ensuring a level of privacy. We derive a sufficient condition on the batch size to prevent data reconstruction attacks. From the optimization theory perspective, we establish an upper bound on the privacy leakage in terms of the batch size, the distortion extent, and several other factors. Our analysis provides insights into the relationship between privacy leakage and various aspects of federated learning, offering a theoretical foundation for designing privacy-preserving federated learning algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Yang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> has gained significant attention in recent years as a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. By keeping the data locally and only exchanging model updates, federated learning mitigates privacy concerns and complies with data protection regulations. It has found applications in various domains, such as mobile computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hard et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Antunes et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, and finance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Long et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the promise of federated learning in protecting data privacy, recent studies have revealed that it is still susceptible to privacy attacks. Adversaries can exploit the shared model updates to infer sensitive information about the participants’ private data. One notable class of attacks is data reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhu et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Geiping et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Yin et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which aim to recover the original training data from the gradients or model updates. These attacks pose a severe threat to the privacy of federated learning participants and undermine the trust in the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To better understand and mitigate privacy risks in federated learning, it is crucial to conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of privacy leakage. Previous works have investigated the privacy guarantees of federated learning from different perspectives, such as differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dwork et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>; Abadi et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> and information theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. However, the theoretical understanding of privacy leakage in federated learning remains limited, especially in terms of the impact of the specific characteristics of federated learning in the local training process, such as the number of local data samples, the number of local epochs, and the batch size.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by providing a theoretical analysis of privacy leakage in federated learning from two complementary perspectives: linear algebra and optimization theory. From the linear algebra perspective, we formulate the local training process as an optimization problem and examine the uniqueness of its solution. We prove that when the Jacobian matrix of the batch data is not full rank, there exist different batches of data that produce the same model update, thereby ensuring a level of privacy. We further derive a sufficient condition on the batch size to prevent data reconstruction attacks. From the optimization theory perspective, we measure the privacy leakage using the discrepancy between the reconstructed data and the original data, and establish an upper bound on the privacy leakage in terms of the batch size, the distortion extent, and several other factors. Our analysis provides insights into the relationship between privacy leakage and various aspects of federated learning, such as the number of local data samples, the number of local epochs, and the batch size.

We consider a semi-honest adversary who follows the protocol faithfully but tries to infer sensitive information from the received messages.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we analyze the privacy of federated learning from the perspective of linear algebra. By formulating the local training process as an optimization problem and examining the uniqueness of its solution, we establish a theoretical basis for understanding how the model update relates to the identifiability of private data. Central to our analysis is the Jacobian matrix, which captures the sensitivity of the model update to changes in the input data. We prove that when the Jacobian matrix is not full rank, there exist different batches of data that produce the same model update, thereby ensuring a level of privacy. Building upon this result, we derive a sufficient condition on the batch size to prevent data reconstruction attacks. This linear algebra based approach provides a rigorous and quantitative framework to reason about privacy in federated learning.</p>

When small changes in batch data cause redundant degrees of freedom in the changes of the model update, different batches of data may correspond to the same model update, making the batch data indeterminable. By fully utilizing this, batch data privacy can be ensured by limiting the rank of the Jacobian matrix.</p>

<p id="S5.p9.1" class="ltx_p">The significance of this theorem lies in its quantitative characterization of the relationship between privacy leakage and various factors in federated learning. It provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the impact of these factors on privacy and can guide the design of privacy-preserving federated learning algorithms. By carefully tuning the batch size, the number of local data samples, and the number of local epochs, one can potentially achieve a better trade-off between privacy and utility in federated learning.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we provided a theoretical analysis of privacy leakage in federated learning from two complementary perspectives: linear algebra and optimization theory. From the linear algebra perspective, we formulated the local training process as an optimization problem and examined the uniqueness of its solution. We proved that when the Jacobian matrix of the batch data is not full rank, there exist different batches of data that produce the same model update, thereby ensuring a level of privacy. We further derived a sufficient condition on the batch size to prevent data reconstruction attacks. From the optimization theory perspective, we measured the privacy leakage using the discrepancy between the reconstructed data and the original data, and established an upper bound on the privacy leakage in terms of the batch size, the distortion extent, and several other factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our analysis provided insights into the design of privacy-preserving federated learning algorithms and highlighted the impact of different factors on privacy leakage. First, increasing the batch size can reduce the upper bound of privacy leakage, as it increases the difficulty for the attacker to reconstruct the original data from the aggregated model updates. Second, increasing the distortion extent, which measures the difference between the gradients computed on the original parameter and the distorted parameter, can also reduce the upper bound of privacy leakage. Third, the number of local data samples and the number of local epochs have implicit effects on privacy leakage through their influence on the batch size and the assumptions on the attacker’s optimization algorithm. By carefully tuning the batch size, the number of local data samples, and the number of local epochs, we can demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for enhancing privacy protection in federated learning, and achieve a better trade-off between privacy and utility in federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are still several open problems and challenges that require further investigation. The theoretical analysis in this paper is based on certain assumptions, such as the bi-Lipschitz condition of gradients and the self-bounded regret of the attacker’s optimization algorithm. Relaxing these assumptions and extending the analysis to more general settings is an important direction for future work. Besides, the derived upper bound on privacy leakage is relatively loose and may not provide tight guarantees in practice. Developing sharper bounds and more precise characterizations of privacy leakage is an open challenge. Furthermore, our analysis can be extended to other types of privacy attacks beyond data reconstruction attacks and generalized to other variants of federated learning, such as vertical federated learning and federated transfer learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, this work contributes to a better understanding of privacy risks in federated learning and provides a theoretical foundation for developing more secure and privacy-preserving federated learning algorithms. We hope that our findings will inspire future research in this important area and contribute to the development of trustworthy and privacy-preserving machine learning systems.</p>
