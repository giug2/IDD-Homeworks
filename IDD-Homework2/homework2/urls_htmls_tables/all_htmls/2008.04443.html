<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Whether the goal is to estimate the number of people that live in a congressional district, to estimate the number of individuals that have died in an armed conflict, or to disambiguate individual authors using bibliographic data, all these applications have a common theme — integrating information from multiple sources. Before such questions can be answered, databases must be cleaned and integrated in a systematic and accurate way, commonly known as record linkage, de-duplication, or entity resolution. In this article, we review motivational applications and seminal papers that have led to the growth of this area. Specifically, we review the foundational work that began in the 1940’s and 50’s that have led to modern probabilistic record linkage. We review clustering approaches to entity resolution, semi- and fully supervised methods, and canonicalization, which are being used throughout industry and academia in applications such as human rights, official statistics, medicine, citation networks, among others. Finally, we discuss current research topics of practical importance.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Information about individuals is often scattered across multiple databases. Combining such information can result in enormous benefits for analysis, resulting in richer and more reliable conclusions. In many applications, however, analysts cannot merge databases based on unique identifiers, often due to privacy reasons or due to the fact that they do not exist. Thus, analysts turn to methods from statistics, computer science, and machine learning known as entity resolution, record linkage, or deduplication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most entity resolution methods are motivated by applications that require the integration of databases before further analyses can occur. Such applications include the United States (U.S.) decennial census, casualty estimation in armed conflicts, voter registration data, and the analysis of co-authorship networks.
For example, in terms of the U.S. Census, it is important that there is a correct and accurate enumeration not only for apportioning the representation of legislators, but also for allocating resources for housing, highways, schools, assistance programs, and other projects that are vital to the prosperity, welfare, and economic growth in the U.S. Record linkage and de-duplication are used to ensure that everyone is counted once and only once. In the context of armed conflicts, enumerating the number of documented identifiable deaths in a conflict is relevant to the prosecution of war crimes and for justice around the world. This requires integrating and de-duplicating information about victims collected by multiple organizations. In terms of voter registration, it is critical that databases have duplicates removed from them such that voters have one unique voter registration record, and thus, vote only once. In addition, it is critical to know how many (unique) individuals are voting in elections and how many individuals are being left out, especially for minority groups. In order to study science and innovation at the individual level, authors and inventors in bibliographic databases must be disambiguated in the absence of unique identifiers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As noted, the applications are widespread across many disciplines including statistics, computer science, economics, medicine, and human rights, among others. Furthermore, entity resolution is not only a crucial task for social science and industrial applications, but is also a challenging statistical and computational problem itself. This was recognized as early as in 1959 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Newcombe et al., <a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">1959</a>)</cite> and the subject has since received growing interest from many communities with the rise of “big data” and modern computing.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This review article provides an introduction to entity resolution and its associated challenges. It overviews modern developments motivated by the social science applications discussed in Section <a href="#S1.SS1" title="1.1 Motivational Applications ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ (Almost) All of Entity Resolution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1.1</span></a>.

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One critical problem in the U.S. occurs every ten years, when the U.S. Census Bureau attempts to enumerate the population as mandated under the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 2. An accurate enumeration is essential as this
is used not only to apportion the representation of legislators, but also to allocate resources for housing, highways, schools, assistance programs, and other projects that are vital to the prosperity, welfare, and economic growth of the country. As the U.S. grows and becomes more diverse, enumerating its population becomes more challenging. For example, many individuals elect not to fill out census forms due to privacy reasons, which results in these individuals not being represented in the enumeration.
Other individuals are duplicated, e.g., students attending universities or private schools (living in group quarters) are often counted twice as they are legally required to be counted by their university/school, while also being counted by their parents/guardians as part of a household <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hogan et al., <a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>.</p>

<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Documented Identifiable Deaths in El Salvador.</h5>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Turning to the context of an armed conflict, creating models enumerating identifiable deaths is challenging as grassroots movements, families, and friends collect multiple reports on the same victims. Between 1980 and 1991, the Republic of El Salvador witnessed a civil war between the central government, the left-wing guerrilla Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), and right-wing paramilitary death squads. After the peace agreement in 1992, the United Nations created a Commission on the Truth (UNTC) for El Salvador, which invited members of Salvadoran society to report war-related human rights violations, which mainly focused on killings and disappearances. In order to collect such information the UNTC invited individuals through newspapers, radio, and television advertisements to come forward and testify. The UNTC opened offices through El Salvador where witnesses could provide their testimonials, and this resulted in a list of potential victims with names, date of death, and reported location.
Due to the fact that testimonials were provided to the UNTC many years after the civil war, it is expected that witnesses could not recall some of the details of the killings. In addition, some details regarding testimonials of the same individual may contain conflicting or differing information. This is a natural characteristic of this data and leads to more noise, distortions, and missingness. Furthermore, a victim can be reported multiple times, which leads to an issue with duplication in the data. Finally,
there are no unique identifiers available for the majority of this data set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hoover Green, <a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Green and Ball, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Sadinle, <a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While working with personally identifiable information is useful for understanding entity resolution models, such data are not typically made public due to privacy concerns and are instead stored in government databases where they cannot be published. One exception is that of voter registration databases, which are publicly available (and often online) in the United States. North Carolina makes its voter registration database freely and publicly available through the North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncsbe.gov/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">http://www.ncsbe.gov/</a>), which provides regular updates. This data set contains rich information, such as first and last name, year of birth, phone number, and address. However, the voter registration number is often duplicated due to people moving, getting married, and various other reasons. See Table <a href="#S1.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Estimation of Voters in North Carolina. ‣ 1.1 Motivational Applications ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ (Almost) All of Entity Resolution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> for examples of public records from this data set.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The process through which voter registration records are matched with other official records can have a profound influence on one’s ability to vote. Georgia’s controversial “exact match” law <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ax, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, which was slightly changed in 2019, required an exact match between voter registration records and records from the Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration in order to validate voter registrations. For instance, typographical errors, different spellings of the same name, or outdated records could place a voter registration on hold. In 2017, about 670,000 registrations were canceled as a result <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nadler, <a href="#bib.bib104" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Enamorado (<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> showed how this law could predominantly affect non-white voters (see also <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Georgia Coalition For the Peoples’ Agenda, Inc. et al v.

<p id="S1.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, one seeks
methods which adapt to the data at hand, and which do not necessarily require training data as it is usually not available. These methods should generalize to a wide variety of applications. In addition, they should be robust to noise and distortions of real world data and make use of prior knowledge.
Many of these requirements involve a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, or between accuracy and modeling complexity. These tradeoffs are valued differently depending on the purpose of an entity resolution task. Therefore, despite attempts at generalizability, the suitability of a given entity resolution approach is often highly application-specific.

Statistically valid quantification of uncertainty requires accounting for possible errors at all stages and propagating uncertainty throughout. This is important when deduplication, record linkage, or entity resolution is used as only the first step of an analysis, as discussed in Section <a href="#S7" title="7 Canonicalization and the Downstream Task ‣ (Almost) All of Entity Resolution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.

For example, often records are stored as a long string of information, such as “John Smith lives at 23 Main St W. in Durham, N.C.” In order to apply record linkage methods, this information must be broken up into a common set of attributes. First, words and punctuation such as “lives”, “at”, “in”, and “.” are removed. Next, the record is broken up to contain the following standardized attributes: <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">civic number</span>: “123”, <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">full road name</span>: “Main Street West”, <span id="S2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">municipality</span>: “Durham”, and <span id="S2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">state</span>: “NC.”</p>

Only records appearing in the same block will then be compared; records that do not appear in the same block are automatically determined to be non-matches.
The simplest blocking method is known as <em id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">traditional blocking</em>, which chooses certain fields (e.g., gender and year of birth) and places records in the same block if and only if they agree on all fields.

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Record attributes are often distorted by noise (due to data entry errors, variant spellings, outdated records, etc.). Naturally, linkage rules should account for slight differences between attributes. One simple way to quantify such differences for names, addresses, and other textual attributes is via string distance functions. For westernized words, string distance functions such as the <span id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">edit</span> distance (or Levenshtein distance) are used to account for deletions, intersections, and substitutions. The Jaro-Winkler distance works well for the comparison of strings with fewer than 9 characters. For more information regarding distance functions, we refer the reader to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cohen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>.
Given such measures of similarity between attributes, thresholds can be introduced as to determine matching attributes.</p>

An example of this rule would be to match records if <span id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p3.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(gender and city of birth agree) OR (date of birth year and city of birth agree)</span> are satisfied.</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To more fully understand the applicability of rule-based methods for entity resolution, we return to the case study of El Salvador introduced in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ (Almost) All of Entity Resolution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. After the peace agreement of 1992, the United Nations Commission on the Truth (UNTC) for El Salvador invited members of Salvadoran society to report war-related human rights violations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Betancur et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>. Testimonials were provided many years after the civil war, resulting in possible distortions in the data. In addition, there is no ground truth for this data set, except for two departments which were hand-matched by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. In total, the <span id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">UNTC</span> data set contains 5395 records.

</div>
<div id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the amount of noise that is thought to be in this particular data set, it is often impossible to be certain that two records match or do not match. For instance, consider a small subset from the UNTC data set in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ An Illustrative Example from El Salvador. ‣ 3 Deterministic Approaches ‣ (Almost) All of Entity Resolution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Records 4 and 5 can be thought of referring to the same individual, but they could also be father and son. For records 1 — 3, there are errors in the month and day of death. Exact matching is not applicable here given these errors. The best that can be done, in many cases, is to estimate the probability that records match. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sadinle (<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> therefore proposed a probabilistic record linkage model where deterministic rules were only used as a blocking criteria.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The first known paper on record linkage was by
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dunn (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">1946</a>)</cite>, who defined record linkage as the process of assembling pieces of information that refer to the same individual.
For example, birth, marriage, health, and death records are spread across different time periods and locations. Assembling this information for death certificates, identity certifications, and official statistical purposes was and still is a motivating application. Thus, in 1946, Dunn wrote:</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<blockquote id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_quote">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_p">“Each person in the world creates a Book of Life. This Book starts with birth and ends with death. Its pages are made up of the records of the principal events in life. Record linkage is the name given to the process of assembling the pages of this Book into a volume.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Interestingly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dunn (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">1946</a>)</cite> framed record linkage as an entirely logistical problem rather than an algorithmic one. He argued that the widespread use of the birth certificate number together with a centralized index would effectively bind together all relevant individual records into their “Book of Life.” This would facilitate and reduce the cost of administrative processes. This has been partly realized with the use of social security numbers, passport numbers, and other unique identifiers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, it is often the case that a unique identifier
(centralized index) is not available, especially when there are multiple databases. In addition, a reliable unique identifier such as a social security number may not be available for a variety of reasons. For example, such identifiers often cannot be shared across all databases, are not available due to privacy reasons, or may not exist altogether.
In such situations, record linkage then becomes both a methodological and algorithmic problem — what can best be used to identify records which refer to the same individual, given noisy, uncertain information?</p>

(<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">1959</a>)</cite> provided the first automatic computer-based solution. In their application, the authors wished to link 34,138 birth records from 1955 British Columbia to 114,471 records of marriage from 1945. The aggregated information would then be used in demographic studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Newcombe and Rhynas, <a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">1962</a>; Newcombe, <a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">1965</a>; Newcombe and Tavendale, <a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">1965</a>; Newcombe, <a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">1969</a>)</cite>. There was no unique identifier for the couples, but the birth and marriage records shared full family names, first initials and birth places, ages on some records, and location of the child birth or marriage events. No single piece of information was entirely reliable, but together they could be used for more accurate record linkage.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p2.6" class="ltx_p">The first assumption is that comparison vectors between the records pairs should be independent from one another.
This is usually not satisfied in practice.
For example, when <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Newcombe et al. (<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">1959</a>)</cite> linked birth and marriage records, it was known that two different marriages could not result in the same birth. This constraint induces dependencies between comparison vectors, and applying the Fellegi-Sunter procedure can lead to impossible linkage configurations when this is not taken into consideration. Moreover, the assumption is not satisfied in the context of one-to-one linkage, where each record in a first file can be linked to at most one other record in a second file. The issue was faced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Jaro (<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">1989</a>)</cite>, where each census record could be matched with at most once record in the post-enumeration survey. To account for this, the author proposed to precede the Fellegi-Sunter likelihood ratio test by a blocking stage, which established a one-to-one constraint. That is, he constructed a first set of one-to-one candidate links between the census and the post-enumeration survey. The candidate links were chosen as to maximize the sum of their matching weights, while satisfying the one-to-one constraint. Among these candidate pairs, the Fellegi-Sunter likelihood ratio test (thresholding the matching weight) was then used to establish the link, possible link or non-link assignment. The same kind of issue also arises when enforcing transitivity between links.

For one thing, the estimation methods discussed so far require conditional independence between the comparison of different record attributes, given the true match/non-match status of the record pairs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Smith and Newcombe (<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">1975</a>)</cite> first remarked that this conditional independence assumption may not hold in practice. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Thibaudeau (<a href="#bib.bib141" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite> (see also <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Armstrong and Mayda (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">1992</a>); Winkler (<a href="#bib.bib160" title="" class="ltx_ref">1992</a>, <a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>) proposed log-linear models with interaction terms to account for dependencies between field comparisons and showed improved performance in some applications. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib168" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> have illustrated recently that the conditional independence assumption can work quite well in practice depending on the discriminatory power of the linkage variables. The authors applied latent class models with a conditional dependence structure informed by the true match status of manually reviewed record pairs. In one scenario, where the attributes have poor discriminating power, the conditional dependence models yields improved matching accuracy compared to the FS model. In a second scenario, where the attributes have good discriminating power for linkage, incorporating conditional dependence results in comparable matching accuracy relative to the FS model. This provides guidance to researchers empirically when conditional independence is reasonable and unreasonable. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Daggy et al.

These parameters are then estimated through Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The Dirichlet distribution is a flexible prior which allows dependencies between the components of comparison vectors, and the Bayesian formulation allows to easily incorporate constraints on the linkage. More specifically, assuming no duplications within a database naturally implies that a record from one database can be linked with at most one record from the other database (this is often referred to as a maximum one-to-one linkage assignment). This constraint is easily incorporated in the Bayesian model through the prior on the matching configuration matrix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Larsen, <a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>.</p>

The authors proposed a supervised method based on random forests
for deduplication. Their training data was constructed from the curriculum vitae of inventors in the field of optometrics as well as from a previous study on “superstar” academics in the life sciences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Azoulay et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>.

Afterwards, applying their entity resolution approach to other records in the USPTO database consisted of a four-stage pipeline. First, they use blocking where, in each block, they calculated
comparison vectors for each record pair. Second, the authors calculated the predicted probability of a match using their random forest classifier applied to these comparison vectors. Third, the predicted probability was converted into an estimate of the dissimilarity between each pair of records. Fourth, the authors utilized single linkage hierarchical clustering corresponding to the dissimilarity scores in the previous step to enforce transitive closures among record pairs. Clusters were determined by cutting the dendogram (tree) at a threshold. Finally, all the clustering results were combined across blocks to obtain a final set of de-duplicated records. Such clustering approaches to ER, used either directly or as a follow-up to pairwise classification, are discussed next in Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Entity Resolution as a Clustering Problem ‣ (Almost) All of Entity Resolution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The methods discussed so far focused on estimating the probability of a match between pairs of records given their comparison vector. This pairwise match probability provides a measure of uncertainty about specific links, where the corresponding false match and false non-match rates (or precision and recall) are pairwise evaluation metrics of performance. With the exception of Bayesian FS, these methods treat record pairs as being independent of one another, without accounting for the consequences of transitivity or other constraints on the linkage structure. This limits their applicability, and specifically in the context of linking more than two databases when duplicates are present across and within databases. For instance, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Sadinle et al.

Specifically, they proposed that one should detect the connected components in the undirected graph of pairwise links (see also <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hernández and Stolfo (<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>, <a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite>).

As with other Bayesian approaches, this allows full quantification of uncertainty regarding the number of latent individuals and the clustering structure of records into coreferent groups. In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Steorts et al.

This resonates with empirical evidence from the entity resolution literature and is related to the separation between entities going to zero. The authors suggest that a logarithmic growth in the number of attributes may be sufficient to achieve accurate entity resolution, and if substantiated, this would be a rather encouraging scenario. More work on the curse and blessing of dimensionality in entity resolution is needed to provide further insight on how much information we need to collect for entity resolution problems and provide practical guidance to users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Johndrow et al., <a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>

Applications are more widespread, dealing with medical, housing, and financial databases, among others. We have introduced the main terminology used in the literature, and we have provided the major challenges that researchers face within an entity resolution framework.
We have presented the pipeline approach (section <a href="#S2" title="2 The Entity Resolution Pipeline ‣ (Almost) All of Entity Resolution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), where the four stages consist of attribute alignment, blocking, entity resolution, and canonicalization.

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite methodological advances, evaluating the performance of entity resolution remains a challenge for a number of reasons. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Murray (<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> expressed concerns regarding over-reliance on simple (toy) datasets that may not be representative of real applications, as this could potentially lead methodological research astray.
As a starting point, we review in Section A.2 of the supplementary materials some public datasets that can be used for comparisons/evaluations. However, given the wide range of fields of application of entity resolution, these datasets are comparatively few in number. We stress that when using “benchmark data sets,” it is crucial that researchers note the number of records under consideration, the level of noise in the data, its overall quality, and the reliability of the unique identifiers used for performance evaluation. In addition, one should not solely rely on toy data sets, but one should perform carefully thought out simulation studies in order to understand robustness to model misspecification to provide practitioners with a guide for using their method. In addition, extreme care should be taken regarding sensitivity of tuning parameters in proposed methods and sensitivity of the evaluated performance on choices of such parameters. Finally, case studies should be considered if possible as this gives one an idea of how proposed methods work for “data in the wild.”</p>

To address these competing goals, many SDC techniques have been proposed and implemented such as top-coding, data swapping, data perturbation, and synthetic data generation, each potentially having its own measures of utility and risk properties; more details are those methods can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fienberg and Slavković, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Hundepool et al., <a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. Furthermore, differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dwork et al., <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite> has emerged as a key rigorous definition of privacy. It provides a framework that can inform the design of privacy mechanisms with specified disclosure risks, in the presence of arbitrary external information.</p>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As we have discussed, analyses often require or can benefit from the linkage of multiple databases. However, when databases are held by different organizations and contain private information that cannot be shared across them, record linkage should be done as to ensure that: (1) private information such as quasi-identifiers (name, date of birth, etc) are not disclosed across organizations during the linkage process, and (2) only relevant summaries of the resulting linkage (usually a set of pre-determined attributes of the linked records) are reported as to manage disclosure risks. The achievement of these two goals is the subject of privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hall and Fienberg, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Vatsalan et al., <a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>, <a href="#bib.bib150" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. This is closely related to the problem of private multi-party data publishing under a vertical partitioning scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jiang and Clifton, <a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>; Mohammed et al., <a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>, <a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Cheng et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. While progress has been made on point (1), the privacy implications of post-linkage data releases are difficult to analyze even under mild adversary models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mohammed et al., <a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Vatsalan et al., <a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>. For instance, any organization involved in PPRL could use its own records to attempt de-anonymizing the released linked data. In other scenarios, an adversarial organization could also use PPRL to gain information about particular individuals. Great care should be taken when using PPRL as to ensure that all disclosure risks are properly assessed.</p>

<div id="A1.SS2.SSS3.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.SS2.SSS3.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have introduced the decennial census data problem in Section 1.1: every ten years, when the U.S. Census Bureau
must enumerate the population in each state as mandated under the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 2. Many individuals elect not to fill out census forms,
which results in them not being counted in the enumeration.
Other individuals may be counted multiple times due to duplicate responses.
For example, students attending universities or private schools (living in group quarters) are often double counted as they are legally required to be counted by their university/school, while also being counted by their parents/guardians as part of a household.
One way to improve coverage is to leverage administrative data, such as the
Social Security Administration’s Numerical Identification System
(Numident). The Numident is the Social Security Administration’s
computer database file of an abstract of the information contained in an
application for a U.S. Social Security number. The following attributes are available for each data set: last name, date of birth, gender, and zip code, which are protected under Title 13, and thus, this data cannot be shared. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Marchant et al.

<p id="A1.SS2.SSS3.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The American National Election Studies (ANES) is a national survey of voters in the United States (U.S.) that is conducted before and after every presidential election.
The target population of the ANES
are U.S. citizens eligible to vote.
Since 2008, the ANES is
carried out via two interview modes —
traditional face-to-face interviews and
more common internet interviews.
The face-to-face component of
the ANES is a multistage stratified cluster sample
of residential addresses, which due to financial constraints
does not include Alaska and Hawaii.
The internet component of the ANES is a random sample of residential
addresses in the U.S. states and the
District of Columbia. In 2016, out of 4,271 ANES respondents,
1,181 were face-to-face and 3,090 were internet respondents.
The corresponding attrition rate from the pre-election to post-election surveys was
10% for the face-to-face and 16% for the internet respondents. For details

In this file, all states have updated their voter files by including information about the 2016 election. It is possible that through routine data cleaning by states and/or L2 that some individuals who voted in the election may have been removed because they either have deceased or
moved. As a result, the L2 voter file has a total of 131 million voters who cast their ballots, whereas, according to the United States Election Projection, approximately 136.7 million individuals voted in the election. In addition, the L2 voter file does not contain overseas voters, which reduces this data set by roughly 5 million voters, and the turn out rate by slightly more than one percentage point.

To understand this further, one must compare the self-reported behavior (2016 ANES) with actual behavior (the 2016 PVF). Thus, this requires record linkage of these two databases.
