<p id="id11.id1" class="ltx_p">Cyberattacks are increasingly threatening networked systems, often with the emergence of new types of unknown (zero-day) attacks and the rise of vulnerable devices. Such attacks can also target multiple components of a Supply Chain, which can be protected via Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, the need to learn large amounts of labelled data often limits the applicability of ML-based IDSs to cybersystems that only have access to private local data, while distributed systems such as Supply Chains have multiple components, each of which must preserve its private data while being targeted by the same attack To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Decentralized and Online Federated Learning Intrusion Detection (DOF-ID) architecture based on the G-Network model with collaborative learning, that allows each IDS used by a specific component to learn from the experience gained in other components, in addition to its own local data, without violating the data privacy of other components. The performance evaluation results using public Kitsune and Bot-IoT datasets show that DOF-ID significantly improves the intrusion detection performance in all of the collaborating components, with acceptable computation time for online learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Much work has been done over the years to secure cyber-physical systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), are important components of such overall cybersecurity schemes which have
often been developed using Machine Learning to detect anomalies and threats
in incoming network traffic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, including multiclass classification to detect different types of attacks in a unified manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL), also known as collaborative learning, is a machine learning technique that trains a machine learning algorithm via multiple independent sessions, each using its own dataset, presenting several advantages and novel research issues<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. This approach contrasts with traditional centralized machine learning techniques where local datasets are merged into one training session, as well as with approaches that assume that local data samples are statistically identical. Thus it is particularly useful when multiple entities such as Supply Chains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, emergency evacuation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, or systems where different types of IoT devices concurrently operate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and when heterogeneous active objects collaborate in a common physical and data driven environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, multiple components of a Supply Chain may experience partially distinct and partially similar types of attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, at different traffic rates and different attack frequencies. Also, the types of attacks and frequency of attacks experienced by a given entity (e.g. a specific sub-system) may be closely connected to its own physical environment which is shared among several flows of supplies, and have different levels of cost, delay and profitability, which that particular a particular sub-system may not wish to share with other systems for competitive reasons. In such cases a “concurrent” yet “federated” type of learning can be used to design an appropriate IDS that may be useful to all sub-systems, provided they do not directly access each other’s data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In recent work G-Networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which are a generalization of the Random Neural Network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and of “queueing networks with negative and positive customers”, have been successfully used for cyberattack detection and IDS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> with deep learning. Furthermore, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> it was shown that appropriately designed auto-associative G-Network models can very accurately detect multiple types of attacks simultaneously with training that is only based on “benign” traffic.
Thus, in this paper we extend this approach using G-Networks for attack detection to Federated Learning where the mix of multiple attacks may vary between distinct sites that share their learning experience but do not share their private data.</p>

The DOF-ID architecture hosts many distinct components of a supply chain, each component having potentially several IoT or IP nodes, each of which utilizes an instance of a common IDS, learns directly from its local data, and collaborates with other components to incorporate their up-to-date knowledge into its IDS. This architecture improves the overall security of all collaborating nodes with online learning between nodes, by taking advantage of the experience of each node, while preserving the confidentiality of the local data at each of these nodes.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper considers the IDS needs od distributed systems, such as Supply Chains, and proposex a novel Decentralized and Online Federated Learning Intrusion Detection (DOF-ID) architecture to improve the detection performance of anomaly-based IDS using a DRNN model and SWBC decision maker, both of which learn using only normal “benign” network traffic. The presented DOF-ID architecture provides a collaborative learning system that enables each node to learn from the experiences of other collaborating nodes without violating data confidentiality. In this way, DOF-ID improves both local and global security levels of all collaborating nodes simultaneously, quickly and effectively eliminating the requirement for a large learning data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper also evaluates the performance of DOF-ID and compares it against the benchmark methods using two public well-known datasets, Kitsune and Bot-IoT. During the performance evaluation, the impact of FL on intrusion detection performance is also investigated. Our experimental results revealed that the proposed DOF-ID method significantly improves the detection performance with a small increase in false positive alarms compared to the same IDS structure learning only from local traffic. In addition, the proposed method has significantly superior performance (at least <math id="S4.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="15\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">15</mn><mo id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">15</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1c">15\%</annotation></semantics></math> accuracy difference) over benchmark methods with higher computation time.</p>

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Future work will expand the experimental setup and evaluate the performance of the proposed DOF-ID architecture for large networked systems such as supply chains, smart grids or large IoT networks. In this context, it wll be interesting to evaluate how these Federated IDS architectures may affect the overall energy consumption of the systems where they are installed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. It would also be interesting to address the distributed communication costs, and the possible performance slowdown that may be caused by federated learning, as well as the new vulnerabilities that may be introduced to the learning process itself in the proposed DOF-ID architecture.</p>
