<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that can learn models from features distributed on different platforms in a privacy-preserving way.
Since in real-world applications the data may contain bias on fairness-sensitive features (e.g., gender), VFL models may inherit bias from training data and become unfair for some user groups.
However, existing fair machine learning methods usually rely on the centralized storage of fairness-sensitive features to achieve model fairness, which are usually inapplicable in federated scenarios.
In this paper, we propose a fair vertical federated learning framework (<span id="id10.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span>), which can improve the fairness of VFL models.
The core idea of <span id="id10.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> is to learn unified and fair representations of samples based on the decentralized feature fields in a privacy-preserving way.
Specifically, each platform with fairness-insensitive features first learns local data representations from local features.
Then, these local representations are uploaded to a server and aggregated into a unified representation for the target task.
In order to learn a fair unified representation, we send it to each platform storing fairness-sensitive features and apply adversarial learning to remove bias from the unified representation inherited from the biased data.
Moreover, for protecting user privacy, we further propose a contrastive adversarial learning method to remove private information from the unified representation in server before sending it to the platforms keeping fairness-sensitive features.
Experiments on three real-world datasets validate that our method can effectively improve model fairness with user privacy well-protected.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the explosion of data volume has enhanced the performance of machine learning (ML) models on many tasks, e.g., personalized recommendation and search <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In many real-world scenarios, feature fields of the same sample may be decentralized on different platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
For instance, video watching behaviors and search engine behaviors of the same user usually spread across different platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.
To learn models from various input features, existing machine learning methods usually rely on centralized storage of different feature fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
However, the data on different platforms is usually privacy-sensitive, and cannot be centralized due to privacy concerns and risks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
Thus, vertical federated learning (VFL), which can utilize decentralized features for unified model learning in a privacy-preserving way, has become more and more important <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing VFL methods usually communicate intermediate results instead of raw data across platforms to enable models utilizing decentralized feature fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Yang
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> proposed a vertical federated framework for logistic regression.
They first calculated local results based on local feature fields, and then shared encrypted local results with a server to make predictions and learn parameters.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Che
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed a vertical federated multi-view learning framework to integrate decentralized medical data.
They locally encoded medical feature fields kept by multiple hospitals into representation vectors and uploaded them to the server for diagnosis prediction.
However, since real-world data usually encodes bias on fairness-sensitive features (e.g., genders and ages) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, VFL models may inherit bias from data and become unfair to some user groups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the importance of fairness in machine learning, fair ML methods have attracted increasing attention in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zafar et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> proposed a fairness-aware optimization framework to improve the model fairness, which can constrain the difference between prediction distributions for different user groups.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Li
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a fair recommendation framework, which quantifies the recommendation unfairness on different user groups as a penalty for item re-ranking.
In general, most of the existing fair ML methods rely on the centralized storage of fairness-sensitive features to achieve model fairness.
However, in vertical federated learning, feature fields are decentralized on different platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, making it difficult to apply existing fair ML methods to improve the fairness of VFL models.
Thus, how to design a fair VFL framework that can protect user privacy and meanwhile improve model fairness, is a rarely studied problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a fair vertical federated learning framework (named <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span>), which can improve the fairness of VFL models in a privacy-preserving way.
In <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span>, we partition data into two groups based on their fairness sensitivities, i.e., fairness-insensitive features that can be used for the target task and fairness-sensitive features (e.g., genders) that should be causally irrelevant to model predictions.
Along this line, the core of <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> is to learn unified and fair representations of samples based on their features distributed across different platforms with user privacy well-protected.
Specifically, platforms with fairness-insensitive features first learn local data representations, which are then uploaded to servers to build unified representations.
Since unified representations encode rich information of raw data, they can be used for the target task without access to the raw data.
Besides, unified representations may inherit bias towards sensitive features (e.g., gender stereotype) from implicit feature correlations in biased data and hurt model fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.
In order to further learn fair unified representations, we apply adversarial learning to unified representations to remove bias encoded in them.
Due to the decentralized storage of feature fields, unified representations are sent to platforms with fairness-sensitive features to learn adversarial gradients.
Besides, since unified representations may still encode some private information of raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, directly sharing them among platforms may incur privacy problems.
Thus, we further use contrastive adversarial learning to remove private information from the unified representations before sending them to other platforms.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> approach can effectively improve the fairness of VFL models and meanwhile the privacy is well protected.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning is a privacy-preserving paradigm for training ML models from feature fields that are kept by different platforms that share the same data ID space, and has been widely studied in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wu
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> proposed a privacy-preserving ad CTR prediction framework with vertical federated learning.
They proposed to coordinate local platforms to learn behavior representations from local features and share the behavior representations with the server to model user interest in ads.
However, since real-world data usually encode bias on fairness-sensitive features (e.g., genders) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, VFL models may inherit bias from data and make unfair decisions for some user groups (e.g., minority users).
To improve model fairness in VFL, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Liu
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> formulated the model performance gap for different user groups as a fairness regularization and incorporated it into the federated optimization objective.
However, their method needs to share the data grouping information with the server, which may also leak user privacy on fairness-sensitive features (e.g., gender).
Different from these methods, we propose a unified framework that can improve the fairness of VFL models which applies the adversarial learning to learn fair models and employ a novel contrastive adversarial learning method to protect user privacy.</p>

Existing fair machine learning methods are usually designed to learn unbiased models with respect to various fairness-sensitive features (e.g., genders).
Some of them applied pre-processing techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> (e.g., resampling) or post-processing techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> (e.g., re-ranking) to improve model fairness.
However, these methods usually independently optimized model accuracy and fairness, which may only achieve a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.

From a fairness perspective, these data can be partitioned into two groups, i.e., fairness-insensitive features and fairness-sensitive features.
The former can be taken by models as the inputs while the latter are expected to be causally irrelevant to the model predictions.

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we present a formal definition of privacy protection and fairness.
The privacy constraint requires that the private information in the local data of a platform should not be disclosed to another platform.
Thus, the raw data of a local platform cannot be disclosed and the intermediate results shared with other platforms should be carefully protected.
Besides, in this paper, we define model fairness from a casual view <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
The counterfactual fairness requires that the model prediction for a sample should always hold if we only change the fairness-sensitive features.
According to the theoretical analysis in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Li
et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span> [<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, eliminating fairness-sensitive feature information in the data representation that is used for the model prediction can achieve casual fairness.
We remark that even though fairness-sensitive features are not taken as the inputs, the model may also inherit bias related to sensitive features by mining inherent shortcuts from data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.
The goal of fair vertical federated learning is to achieve a good trade-off among performance, privacy, and fairness, i.e., improving the fairness of VFL models with minimal performance drop in a privacy-preserving way.</p>

In <span id="S3.SS2.p1.18.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span>, local models are used to encode local fairness-insensitive features into local representations.
We remark that <span id="S3.SS2.p1.18.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> is a general framework and the architecture of a specific local model can be adjusted based on the input data.
For example, the local models for encoding textual search logs can be implemented by transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> or PLMs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">As introduced in Sec. <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Federated Model Serving ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ FairVFL: A Fair Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Contrastive Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>, the task prediction for each sample is computed based on their unified representation <span id="S3.SS3.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">s</span>.
Thus, the core of <span id="S3.SS3.p1.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> to achieve counterfactual fairness is to learn a fair and unified representation <span id="S3.SS3.p1.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">s</span> that does not encode fairness-sensitive bias.
Although the fairness-sensitive features are not model inputs, the model may still encode bias related to them by mining inherent shortcuts to these features from data.
Thus, we apply adversarial learning to prevent unified representations from encoding fairness-sensitive bias.
Vanilla adversarial learning techniques usually rely on centralized storage of input data and labels of fairness-sensitive attributes to learn adversarial gradients for model training.
However, in vertical federated scenarios, feature fields are decentralized on different platforms, which brings challenges to the application of existing methods.
An intuitive solution is sharing the unified representation with platforms that store observed fairness-sensitive features <math id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{P^{a}_{i}|i=1,2,...,m\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.3.1.cmml">{</mo><msubsup id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.2.cmml">P</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.3.cmml">a</mi></msubsup><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.4" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.3.1.cmml">|</mo><mrow id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.2.cmml">i</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.2.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.2.2.cmml">2</mn><mo id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.3.3.cmml">…</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.4.4" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.4.4.cmml">m</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.5" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.3.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.3">conditional-set</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.2">𝑃</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.2.3">𝑎</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.5.5.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2"><eq id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.1"></eq><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.2">𝑖</ci><list id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6.6.2.2.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.2.2">2</cn><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.3.3">…</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.4.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.4.4">𝑚</ci></list></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.3.m3.6c">\{P^{a}_{i}|i=1,2,...,m\}</annotation></semantics></math> to learn corresponding adversarial gradients.
However, unified representations usually encode some private information, and directly sharing them across different platforms may lead to user privacy leakage.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a contrastive adversarial learning technique to protect user privacy by modifying unified representations.</p>

In <span id="S3.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span>, each data platform locally keeps its private data and never shares it with the outside, which can protect user privacy to some extent.
Besides, for the vertical federated model learning and inference, the intermediate model results, i.e., data representations and model gradients, need to be exchanged across platforms, which may lead to potential privacy leakage.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a contrastive adversarial learning method to protect private information in data representations, which can compare data representations with the same attribute and remove the attribute-irrelated information in them.
To further protect private information in gradients, we can apply differential privacy techniques to perturb exchanged gradients as standard VFL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.</p>

It contains rich feature fields (e.g., education and social relation) for income prediction.
20,000 randomly selected data samples are used to construct training and validation dataset, and 10,000 randomly selected data samples are used to construct test dataset.
Following existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, we treat gender and age as fairness-sensitive features and utilize other feature fields for income prediction.

These three types of data are decentralized on three platforms under VFL settings.
We randomly select 100,000 news impressions in the first three weeks to construct the training and validation set and select 100,000 news impressions in the last week to construct the test set.
Besides, we also treat gender and age as fairness-sensitive attributes in <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NEWS</span>.

To simulate the VFL setting, we use the raw images and a part of the raw attributes (i.e., the “Straight Hair” attribute and “Wavy Hair”) as the input features.
The raw images are stored in a data platform and other input attributes are stored in another platform.
The target task is to classify whether the input sample has the attribute “Smiling”.
We also treat gender (the “Male” attribute) as the target fairness-sensitive attribute.</p>

If attackers can distinguish fairness-sensitive bias from unified representations then we can say the model is unfair.
Thus, a lower F1 score on the fairness-sensitive feature classification task means better model fairness.
Besides, we use accuracy and F1 score to evaluate the classification task on <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADULT</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CelebA</span>.

These methods rely on centralized storage of features to learn fair ML models.
Besides, both <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> and these three methods are general frameworks and can be applied to basic models to improve their fairness.
In addition, baseline methods also include a standard vertical federated representation learning method (<span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VFL</span>) without fairness criterion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.

First, basic models based on vertical federated training (e.g., MLP+VFL) can achieve similar performance with the same basic models based on centralized training (e.g., MLP).
These results show that the vertical federated learning technique can effectively enable ML models to utilize decentralized feature fields for target tasks without the disclose of raw data.
Second, models without the protection of fair ML methods (e.g., MLP and MLP+VFL) are biased by fairness-sensitive features.
This is because data may encode bias on sensitive features like genders.
Models may inherit bias from data and become unfair to some user groups.
Third, after applying our <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> method to basic models, the fairness of these models effectively improves.
This is because our <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> method applies the adversarial learning on bias discrimination to unified representations, which can effectively reduce bias encoded in them and improve model fairness.
Fourth, compared with models protected by centralized fair machine learning methods (i.e., <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairGo</span>, <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairSM</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairRec</span>), models protected by <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> can achieve similar performance and fairness.
These results verify that our <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> method can effectively improve the fairness of VFL models.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first evaluate the effectiveness of adversarial learning in improving model fairness.
Due to space limitations, we only show results on <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADULT</span> in the following sections.
Results are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.3 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ FairVFL: A Fair Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Contrastive Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, from which we have several observations.
First, after removing adversarial learning on gender discrimination, model fairness on user gender seriously drops.
This is because users of the same gender usually have similar behavior patterns and there may exist gender bias in data.
Models may inherit gender bias from implicit feature correlations in data and become unfair to some user groups.
To tackle this challenge, <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> applies adversarial learning on bias discrimination to unified representations to reduce gender bias encoded in them.
Second, removing adversarial learning for age discrimination also seriously hurts model fairness on user age, which further verifies the effectiveness of adversarial learning for improving model fairness.</p>

Since unified representations include private information of fairness-insensitive features on local platforms, communicating them across platforms may arouse privacy concerns.

A lower inference accuracy (the F1 value) means better privacy protection.
We remark that for fairness evaluation, we distinguish bias on fairness-sensitive features from unified representations instead of the shared representations, and these sensitive features are also not the input of representation learning.
We only show results on two representative feature fields (i.e., education, and social relation) in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.3 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ FairVFL: A Fair Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Contrastive Adversarial Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> due to space limitations.
First, without the protection of contrastive adversarial learning, shared representations are very informative for inferring private user information.
These results verify that directly sharing unified representations across platforms may leak user privacy.
Second, contrastive adversarial learning can effectively protect user privacy in protected representations.
This is because contrastive adversarial learning enforces protected representations to be indistinguishable for predicting its preimage from unified representations of the same fairness-sensitive features, which can effectively reduce bias-irrelevant personal information in shared representations.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a fair vertical federated learning framework (named <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span>), which can improve the fairness of VFL models in a privacy-preserving way.
The core of <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> is to learn fair and unified representations to encode samples based on their decentralized feature fields.
Each platform storing fairness-insensitive features first learns local representations from their local features.
Then these local representations are uploaded to a server to form a unified representation used for the target task.
In order to further learn fair and unified representations, we send them to platforms storing fairness-sensitive features and apply adversarial learning to reduce bias encoded in them.
Besides, to protect shared representations from leaking user privacy, we propose a contrastive adversarial learning method to reduce user private information in them before sharing them with other platforms.
Experimental results on three datasets show that <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span> is comparable with centralized baseline fair ML methods in terms of both performance and fairness, meanwhile effectively protects user privacy.</p>

In our future work, we plan to study an asynchronous communication mechanism to reduce the communication latency of <span id="Sx3.SSx4.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FairVFL</span>.</p>
