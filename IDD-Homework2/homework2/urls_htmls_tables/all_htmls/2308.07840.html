<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Facilitated by mobile edge computing, client-edge-cloud hierarchical federated learning (HFL) enables communication-efficient model training in a widespread area but also incurs additional security and privacy challenges from intermediate model aggregations and remains the single point of failure issue. To tackle these challenges, we propose a blockchain-based HFL (BHFL) system that operates a permissioned blockchain among edge servers for model aggregation without the need for a centralized cloud server. The employment of blockchain, however, introduces additional overhead. To enable a compact and efficient workflow, we design a novel lightweight consensus algorithm, named Proof of Federated Edge Learning (PoFEL), to recycle the energy consumed for local model training. Specifically, the leader node is selected by evaluating the intermediate FEL models from all edge servers instead of other energy-wasting but meaningless calculations. This design thus improves the system efficiency compared with traditional BHFL frameworks.
To prevent model plagiarism and bribery voting during the consensus process, we propose Hash-based Commitment and Digital Signature (HCDS) and Bayesian Truth Serum-based Voting (BTSV) schemes. Finally, we devise an incentive mechanism to motivate continuous contributions from clients to the learning task. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed BHFL system with the corresponding consensus protocol and incentive mechanism achieves effectiveness, low computational cost, and fairness.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">AS the increasing amount of data generated at end devices causes massive communication and latency overhead for traditional cloud computing, mobile edge computing (MEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has been implemented to serve end users promptly at proximity to achieve cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the network. Machine learning (ML) tasks at end devices are offloaded by sending data to edge servers for analysis and calculation. Due to data privacy and communication cost concerns,
federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is introduced in MEC to form a new distributed ML paradigm, namely federated edge learning (FEL), where the edge server acts as the parameter server and proximate devices within the server’s cover range work as FL clients to train ML model collaboratively. However, since end devices are widely spread across a vast area, one single server may not be capable of implementing FEL among all of them, stimulating the idea of hierarchical federated edge learning (HFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. According to the HFL framework illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ PoFEL: Energy-efficient Consensus for Blockchain-based Hierarchical Federated Learning This work was supported in part by the US NSF under Grant CNS-2105004.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the implementation of HFL still faces two major challenges: i) the single cloud server risks the whole system with the single-point failure; and ii) the layered topology introduces additional model security and privacy issues, such as model poisoning attacks by altering the intermediate models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and leaking the local models of end devices at the edge servers. Such inherent issues become an obstacle to deploying HFL in practice.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One promising solution is introducing the blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> into HFL to omit the need for a central server, as well as provide transparent and reliable model exchanges and global model aggregations, so as to realize better security performance. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ PoFEL: Energy-efficient Consensus for Blockchain-based Hierarchical Federated Learning This work was supported in part by the US NSF under Grant CNS-2105004. (Corresponding Author: Qin Hu.) Shengyang Li is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), IN, 46202, USA. This work was partially done when he was with the Department of Computer and Information Science at IUPUI. E-mail: sl137@iu.edu Qin Hu and Zhilin Wang are with the Department of Computer and Information Science, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), IN, 46202, USA. E-mail: {qinhu, wangzhil}@iu.edu" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>, we propose a blockchain-based HFL (BHFL), where edge servers of HFL form a consortium blockchain network and exchange intermediate models on the blockchain. The global model aggregation is then performed in a distributed and traceable manner instead of the centralized way in the traditional HFL. The consortium blockchain provides a transparent and secure platform for FL, and all edge servers can track and audit the whole FL process independently. The lower layer of our proposed framework is the same as that of the traditional HFL, where each edge server and the connected clients
exchange local model updates and aggregated intermediate models several times in multiple FEL iterations.
Limited related work about implementing blockchain in HFL can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> while others involving the keywords of blockchain, hierarchical, and FL are applying hierarchical blockchain to FEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors replace the cloud server with a dedicated blockchain as the top layer, and the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> append a blockchain between edge servers and the cloud server to work as a storage and record platform. Different from these existing studies deploying the blockchain as an additional part of HFL, our proposed system fully integrates blockchain with HFL through deploying blockchain on edge servers, thus being more compact and efficient compared with these existing BHFL frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to deploy the proposed BHFL framework. First, the existing consensus protocols cannot be arbitrarily implemented in this BHFL system since they are usually working as an additional process to determine the generator of a new block besides finishing the FL computation task, bringing extra computational overhead to edge servers and slowing down the training speed of the global model. Second, the intermediate models of edge servers need to be uploaded to the blockchain during the consensus process for verification and block generation, which makes it easy for some malicious edge servers to plagiarize models shared by other edge servers without performing the actual FEL process.
Moreover, given that numerous end devices conduct FL tasks via the coordination of distributed edge servers, consuming extensive computing and communication resources, it is imperative to provide sufficient incentives to them to compensate for their cost and motivate their long-term participation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we design an energy-efficient consensus algorithm, named PoFEL, to address the first challenge, where the intermediate models of FEL at edge servers are utilized to determine the leader in the consortium blockchain. To solve the plagiarism issue, we design a cryptographic scheme named HCDS, combining Hash, Commitment Scheme, and Digital Signature, to validate the process of model exchanges among edge servers without worrying about their dishonesty. We employ cosine similarity to measure the difference between the aggregated global model and each intermediate model from the edge server, based on which each edge server votes the edge server with the lowest difference to be the leader node. All votes will be sent to a smart contract for vote tallying,
with a weighted voting system that adopted Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS) scoring method to tackle the potential issue of bribery voting. Finally, we propose a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism to address the motivation challenge.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a client-edge-cloud HFL system where edge servers are deployed as intermediate model aggregators to reduce the overall communication cost and the processing burden of the cloud, along with the design of
a hierarchical FL aggregation algorithm named HierFAVG and its convergence analysis. This paper serves as a very promising and classical FEL architecture. Various following papers investigated the remaining issues of FEL systems. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> devise a novel client-edge assignment scheme based on client location, data distribution, and communication constraints under the same FEL system architecture, where the optimization goal is to minimize FL convergence time, as well as communication and computation cost of the whole system. Similarly, Lim et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> extend the FEL system proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> to support multiple model owners, where each edge server serves as a cluster head that connects with a model owner. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> investigate the model training challenges in a Hybrid Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HHFEL) system with device stragglers. They design an online semi-asynchronous FL approach to improve training efficiency by optimizing resource allocation and device selection.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a framework called FLchain, in which the blockchain is maintained by edge servers and a portion of powerful local devices.
Chai et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> introduce a hierarchical blockchain structure into FEL to achieve knowledge sharing among the internet of vehicles. Roadside units (RSUs) are grouped according to their locations and communication ranges, and then a ground blockchain is formulated by a group of RSUs and used for recording model updates submitted from low-level FL clients, i.e., vehicles. RSUs would integrate these model updates with their own trained model updates and then upload integrated results to the top blockchain composed of base stations.
Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> propose a similar hierarchical blockchain-enabled FL framework in which an inter-microchain network interconnects multiple independent microchain consensus networks composed of clients and intermediate aggregators. The FL server and aggregators form the inter-microchain and a subset of them are selected as a validator committee to execute Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to record microchains’ checkpoints. Both studies apply the hierarchical blockchain to FL but the extra system cost in terms of latency and energy is not discussed.</p>

Resulting models are further uploaded to a permissioned blockchain that works as the cloud server for global model aggregation. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> implement a data transmission model using the idea of edge computing, FL, and blockchain.

Huang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> propose a multi-layer blockchain-based HFL network consisting of an IoT devices layer, edge layer, blockchain layer, and cloud layer.

In each round, all BCFL nodes perform the consensus mechanism to determine a leader for block generation. Each BCFL node first broadcasts its FEL model and then computes the updated global model using all received FEL models. The consensus mechanism is based on the similarity between each FEL model and the updated global model.

Once all BCFL nodes have received and verified the new block through broadcasting, they will add it to their own ledger to finish the blockchain updating.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our proposed PoFEL consensus algorithm, the broadcast of FEL models among BCFL nodes can lead to the issues of model plagiarism, where a malicious node might copy another node’s submission with or without editing, or even fabricate an FEL model via merging multiple models from others and then claims the plagiarized model. To overcome this challenge, we devise a Hash-based Commitment scheme integrated with Digital Signature (HCDS) that enforces each BCFL node to strictly follow the BHFL protocol and submit their own FEL models.

Therefore, BTSV is developed to count votes in the form of a smart contract. BTS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> is a scoring approach that assigns higher scores to voters picking the common options. The underlying rationale is if a voter indeed has a preference for an option, s/he tends to believe others have similar preferences. As for a voter with a relatively low cumulative score, predefined penalties will be incurred, such as reward reduction or lower voting weight during tallying.

A sigmoid function is employed to transform this cumulative BTS score into a weight, ensuring the voting weight is appropriately scaled and constrained within a specific range. Specifically, when the cumulative BTS score is lower, the weight approaches 0, and as the cumulative BTS score increases, the weight also increases to approaching the maximum value. This mechanism ensures that nodes with higher cumulative BTS scores have stronger voting power, while those with lower scores have a limited influence on the voting process. Finally, the votes are tallied, and the leader node with the highest adjusted votes is selected. The detailed procedures are summarized in Algorithm <a href="#alg4" title="Algorithm 4 ‣ 4.3 Bayesian Truth Serum-based Voting (BTSV) for Leader ‣ 4 PoFEL: Energy Efficient Consensus Algorithm Design ‣ PoFEL: Energy-efficient Consensus for Blockchain-based Hierarchical Federated Learning This work was supported in part by the US NSF under Grant CNS-2105004.

A sigmoid function is chosen as it limits the range of WV with an ”S” shape, where too-small or too-large CHS results in a smoother change of WV. This aligns with our objective of strongly rewarding or penalizing nodes when they start showing good or bad behaviors instead of reaching extreme cases.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To motivate end devices to contribute to FEL tasks continuously and encourage BCFL nodes to maintain the blockchain, block generation rewards to BCFL nodes and FEL rewards to the FEL clusters are required. The leader node selected by the consensus algorithm at each BCFL round will acquire a fixed number of rewards. These rewards come from the task publisher’s budget and could be determined when the learning task is initially published. Thus, in this section, we mainly focus on designing an incentive scheme to distribute FEL rewards through BCFL nodes from the FL task publisher to the clients contributing to the learning task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The task publisher will provide rewards to motivate FEL clusters to work on the requested learning task. Rewards for an FEL cluster are first determined between the task publisher and the BCFL node, who will distribute rewards to end devices according to a pre-defined rule. An example distribution rule could be based on the CPU cycle frequency spent by each end device. In our framework, the major challenge of incentive mechanism exists at the blockchain level between the task publisher and BCFL nodes.

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In BCFL, the consensus algorithm usually requires all BCFL nodes to exchange their models in the first step for model aggregation, leader election, and verification. However, in this sort of distributed network, it is difficult to achieve model exchanges at all nodes at the same time.
In other words, some nodes could receive models much earlier than others. This provides a chance for malicious nodes that received models earlier to plagiarize models so that they could obtain rewards without consuming their own resources.

<p id="S7.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, experiments are designed to analyze the computation cost and the randomness of the ME mechanism. Randomness refers to the difference in the chance of each BCFL node participating in the same FL task being selected as the leader. The randomness metric directly reflects the fairness of ME. The input of the ME scheme is FEL models. Therefore, the number of BCFL nodes and the model complexity will affect its computation time.</p>

Observations indicate less fairness when the data distribution is non-IID. This could be caused by the dominance of several BCFL nodes having more labels available on their associated clients’ local data compared with other BCFL nodes. Given more diverse data, the FEL model learned is more representative. The chance of the BCFL node being selected as the leader increases. The randomness of ME is closely related to the actual distribution of the data possessed by each client.</p>

Here we refer to honest and malicious BCFL nodes as honest nodes (HNs) and malicious nodes (MNs), respectively. For comparison, we design two attack strategies: targeted attack (TA) and random attack (RA), where TA means that all MNs collude with each other and vote the same BCFL node as the leader, while RA implies that each MN randomly casts a vote for a BCFL node.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a BHFL framework with a novel efficient consensus algorithm to avoid extra waste of computation resources during blockchain consensus. The consensus algorithm utilizes intermediate models from BCFL nodes and compares each model with the updated global model for leader node election. Additionally, we combine the Hash-based Commitment and Digital Signature Algorithm to resolve the model plagiarism issue that occurs during the model exchange process; and we also employ BTSV in the vote tally smart contract for determining the leader node so as to prevent voting bribery from malicious nodes. A two-stage Stackelberg game is modeled to design the incentive mechanism, providing motivation for clients in the FEL clusters to contribute to the learning task. Experimental results demonstrate the validity, fairness, and efficiency of our proposed system and mechanisms. In the future, we plan to design a consensus mechanism that enables more fairness among blockchain nodes regarding leader election when the training data is non-IID.</p>
