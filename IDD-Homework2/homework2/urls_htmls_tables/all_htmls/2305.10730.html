<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Although Federated Learning (FL) enables global model training across clients without compromising their raw data, existing Federated Averaging (FedAvg)-based methods suffer from the problem of low inference performance, especially
for unevenly distributed data among clients.
This is mainly because i) FedAvg initializes client models
with the same global models,
which makes the local training hard to escape from the local search for optimal solutions; and ii) by averaging model parameters in a coarse manner, FedAvg eclipses the individual characteristics of local models.
To address such issues that strongly limit the inference capability of FL,
we propose a novel and effective FL paradigm named FedMR (Federated Model Recombination). Unlike conventional FedAvg-based methods, the cloud server of FedMR shuffles each layer of collected local models and recombines them to achieve new models for local training on clients. Due to the diversified
initialization models for clients coupled with
fine-grained model recombination, FedMR can converge to a well-generalized global model for all the clients,
leading to a superior inference performance.
Experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art FL methods, FedMR can significantly improve inference accuracy in a quicker manner
without exposing client privacy.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has been widely acknowledged as a promising means to design large-scale distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, e.g., Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, healthcare systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and recommender systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Unlike conventional Deep Learning (DL) methods, the cloud-client architecture based
FL supports the collaborative training of a global DL model among
clients without compromising their data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
In each FL training round, the cloud server first dispatches an intermediate model to its selected clients for local training and then gathers the corresponding gradients of trained models from clients for aggregation.
In this way, only clients can touch their own
raw data, thus client privacy is guaranteed.
Although FL enables effective collaborative training towards a global optimal model for all the clients,
when dealing with unevenly distributed data on clients, existing mainstream FL methods suffer from the problem of “weight divergence” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Especially when the data on clients are non-IID (Identically and Independently Distributed) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the optimal directions of local models on clients and the aggregated global model on the cloud server
are significantly inconsistent, resulting in serious inference performance degradation of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Aiming to mitigate such a phenomenon and improve FL performance in non-IID scenarios, various FL methods have been studied, e.g., client grouping-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, global control variable-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and Knowledge Distillation (KD)-based methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
The basic ideas of these solutions are to guide the local training on clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> or adjust parameter weights for model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Although these methods are promising to alleviate the impact of data heterogeneity, most of them adopt the well-known Federated Averaging (FedAvg)-based aggregation, which may potentially reduce the generalization performance.
This is mainly because
FedAvg operations only average the parameters of collected local models in a coarse manner, where the specific characteristics of client data learned by local models are almost neglected.
As a result, an intermediate global model based on simple statistical averaging cannot accurately reflect both the individual efforts and potential of local models in searching for optimal global models.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the average operation, another bottleneck of FedAvg is the uniform global
model for local training initialization,
which further degrades the overall generalization performance of
derived global models.
Some recent research on model training indicates
that, from the perspective of the loss landscapes of DL models,
optimal solutions
with the best generalization performance often lie in flat valleys, while inferior ones are always located in sharp ravines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
According to such a finding, the generalization performance of FedAvg is hard to be guaranteed.
This is because
FedAvg initializes the local training with the same global models, which
limits the diversity of local searching. This will inevitably result in the
notorious <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stuck-at-local-search</span> problem during the local training, leading to the problems of both an extremely long
convergence time and low inference performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above issues, this paper
proposes a novel FL paradigm called FedMR
(<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">M</span>odel <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">R</span>ecombination), which
can effectively help the training of local models escape from local minima, while the individual
characteristics of local models are still maintained.
Unlike FedAvg that aggregates all the collected
local models in each
FL training round, FedMR randomly shuffles the
parameters of different local models within the same layers,
and recombines them to form new local models.
In this way,
FedMR can not only keep
individual characteristics of local models at layer-level, but also
derive diversified models that can effectively escape
from local optimal solutions for the local training of clients.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the problem of uneven data distributions,
exiting solutions
can be mainly
classified into three categories, i.e., client grouping-based methods, global control variable-based methods, and knowledge distillation-based methods.
The <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">device grouping-based methods</span>
group and select clients for aggregation based on the data similarity between clients. For example, FedCluster <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> divides
clients into multiple clusters and performs multiple cycles of meta-update
to boost the overall FL convergence. Based on either
sample size or model similarity,
CluSamp <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> groups clients to achieve a better
client representativity and a reduced variance of client stochastic
aggregation parameters in FL.
By modifying the penalty terms of loss functions during FL
training, the <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global control variable-based methods</span>
can be used to
smooth the FL convergence process.
For example,
FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> regularizes local loss functions with the squared distance between local models and the global model to stabilize the model convergence. Similarly, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> uses
global control variables to correct the “client-drift” problem in the local training process.
<span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Knowledge Distillation (KD)-based methods</span> adopt soft targets generated by the “teacher model” to guide the training of “student models”.
For example, by leveraging a proxy dataset, Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a data-free knowledge distillation method named FedGen to address the heterogeneous FL problem using a built-in generator. With ensemble distillation, FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> accelerates the FL training by training
the global model through unlabeled data on the outputs of local models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the above methods can optimize FL performance from different perspectives, since conducts coarse-grained model aggregation, the inference capabilities of local models are still strongly restricted.
Furthermore, most of them cannot avoid non-negligible communication and computation overheads or the risk of data privacy exposure.
To the best of our knowledge, FedMR is the first attempt that uses
model recombination and different models
for fine-grained FL. Since FedMR considers the
specific characteristics and efforts of local models,
it can further mitigate the weight divergence problem, thus achieving
better inference performance than state-of-the-art FL methods.

the FL training processes on the same loss landscape using FedAvg and Independent training (Indep), respectively, where the server of Indep just shuffles the received local models and then randomly dispatches them to clients without aggregation.
In each subfigure, the local optima
are located within the areas surrounded by red solid lines. Note that,
since the upper surrounded area
is flatter than the lower surrounded area in the loss landscape,
the solutions within it will exhibit
better generalization.</p>
</div>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 Motivation ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a),
along with the training process,
the aggregated global models denoted by
red circles gradually move toward the lower
sharp area with inferior solutions, though
the optimization of some local models heads toward the upper surrounded area
with better solutions.
The reason for such biased
training is mainly because
the local training starts from the same
global model in each FL round.
As an alternative, due to the lack of aggregation operation, the local models of Indep may converge in different directions as shown in
Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 Motivation ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b).
In this case, even if
some local training in Idep
achieves a better solution than
the one obtained by FedAvg,
due to diversified optimization directions of local models, such an important finding
can be eclipsed by the
results of other local models.
Clearly, there is a lack of
mechanisms for Indep that can
guide the overall training
toward such superior solutions.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Intuition of Model Recombination.</span>
Based on the Indep training results shown in
Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 Motivation ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b),
Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Motivation ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrates
the intuition of our model recombination method, where the
FL training starts from the three local models (denoted by
yellow diamonds in round 1) obtained in figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 Motivation ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b). Note that, at the beginning of round 1,
two of the three local models are located in the sharp ravine.
In other words, without model recombination,
the training of such two local models may get stuck in the lower surrounded
area. However, due to the weight adjustment by shuffling the layers among local models, we can find that
the three recombined models (denoted by yellow squares) are sparsely scattered in the loss landscape, which enables the local training
escape from local optima.
According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>,
a small perturbation of the model weights can make it easier for local training to jump out of sharp ravines rather than flat valleys.
In other words, the recombined
models are more likely to converge toward
flat valleys along the local training.
For example, in the end of round 3, we can find that all three local models are located in the upper surrounded area, where their aggregated model has better generalization performance
than the one achieved in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3 Motivation ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a).</p>

The cloud server decomposes received
local models into multiple layers individually
in the same manner and then conducts the random shuffling of the same layers among different local models. Finally, by concatenating layers
from different sources in order, a new local model can be
reconstructed. Note that any decomposed layer of the uploaded model will eventually be used by one and only one of the
recombined models.

Note that the global model will be dispatched by the cloud server to all
the clients for the purpose of inference
rather than local training.
The following parts will detail the
key components of FedMR.
Since FedMR cannot adapt to the secure aggregation mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, to further protect privacy, we present an extended secure recombination mechanism in Appendix <a href="#A2" title="Appendix B Secure Model Recombination Mechanism ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a>, which enables the exchange of partial layers among clients before local training or model uploading to ensure that the cloud server cannot directly obtain the gradients of each local model.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although FedMR enables finer
FL training, when starting from blank models,
FedMR converges more slowly than
traditional FL methods at the beginning. This is mainly because, due to the low matching degree between layers in the recombined models,
the model recombination operation in this stage
requires more local training time to re-construct the new dependencies between layers. To accelerate the overall convergence, we
propose a two-stage training scheme for FedMR, consisting of both the <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aggregation-based pre-training stage</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model recombination stage</span>.
In the first stage, we
train the local models coarsely using the
FedAvg-based aggregation, which can quickly form a pre-trained
global model. In the second stage, starting from the
pre-trained models, FedMR dispatches recombined models to clients
for local training. Due to the synergy
of both FL paradigms, the overall FedMR training time can be reduced.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the effectiveness of FedMR, we implemented FedMR
on top of a cloud-based
architecture. Since it is impractical to allow
all the clients to get involved in the training processes simultaneously,
we assumed that there are only 10% of clients participating in the local training
in each FL round. To enable fair comparison, all the investigated
FL methods including FedMR set
SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and a momentum of 0.9.
For each client, we set the batch size of local training to 50, and performed
five epochs for each local training. All the experimental results were obtained
from an Ubuntu workstation with Intel i9 CPU, 32GB memory, and NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU.</p>

Here, FedAvg is the most classical FL method, while
the other five methods are the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
representatives of the three kinds of FL
optimization methods introduced in the related work section.
Specifically, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, and MOON are global control variable-based methods, FedGen is a KD-based approach, and CluSamp is a device grouping-based method.
For FedProx, we used a hyper-parameter <math id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">μ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝜇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\mu</annotation></semantics></math> to control the weight of its proximal term, where the best values of <math id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">μ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝜇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1c">\mu</annotation></semantics></math> for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FEMNIST

For FedGen, we adopted the same server settings presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
For CluSamp, the clients were clustered based on the model gradient similarity

the raw data of FEMNIST are naturally non-IID distributed. Since FEMNIST takes
various kinds of data heterogeneity
into account, we did not apply the
Dirichlet distribution on FEMNIST.
For both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we assumed that there are 100 clients in total participating
in FL. For FEMNIST, we only considered one non-IID scenario
involving 180 clients, where each client hosts more than 100 local
data samples.

To demonstrate the pervasiveness of our approach, we
developed different FedMR implementations
based on
three different models (i.e., CNN, ResNet-20, VGG-16).
Here, we obtained the CNN model from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which
consists of
two convolutional layers and two FC layers.
When conducting
FedMR based on the CNN model, we directly applied
the model recombination for local training on
it without pre-training a global model, since CNN here
only has four layers.
We obtained both ResNet-20 and VGG-16 models from Torchvision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. ·
When performing
FedMR based on ResNet-20 and VGG-16,
due to the deep structure of both models,
we adopted the two-stage training scheme, where the first stage
lasts for 100 rounds
to obtain a pre-trained global model.</p>

Figures <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Validation for Intuitions ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>
compares Indep with FedAvg from the perspectives of
both test loss and inference accuracy.
Due to the space limitation, for Indep here we only
present the results of its four random local models (denoted by Model-1, Model-2, Model-3, and Model-4).
To enable a fair comparison with FedAvg,
although there is no aggregated global model in Indep,
we considered
the aggregated model of all its local models for
each FL round, whose results are indicated by the notion “IndepAggr”.
From Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Validation for Intuitions ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we can find
that all the local models in Indep can achieve both higher accuracy and lower loss than those of FedAvg, though their loss and accuracy curves fluctuate more sharply.
Moreover, IndepAggr exhibits much worse performance than the other references.
This is mainly because, according to the definition of Indep, each local model needs to traverse multiple
clients along with the FL training processes, where the
optimization directions of client models differ in the corresponding loss landscape.</p>

To validate the intuition about the
impacts of model recombination as presented in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Motivation ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we conducted
three experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset using ResNet-20 model.
Our goal is to figure out the following three questions:
i) by using model recombination, can all the models eventually have the same optimization direction;
ii) compared with FedAvg, can the global model of FedMR eventually converge into a more flat solution; and
iii) can the global model of FedMR eventually converge to a more generalized solution?</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Validation for Intuitions ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> presents the average cosine similarity between all the intermediate models, taking four different client data distributions into account.
We can observe that the model similarity decreases first and then gradually increases in all the investigated IID and non-IID scenarios.
This is mainly because, due to the nature of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) mechanism and the data heterogeneity among clients,
all local models are optimized toward different directions at the beginning of training. However, as the training progresses, the majority of local models will be located in the same flat valleys, leading to similar optimization directions for local models.
These results are consistent with our intuition as shown in

For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we can find that FedMR outperforms the six baseline methods significantly in both non-IID and IID scenarios.
For example, when dealing with a non-IID CIFAR-10 scenario (<math id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha=0.1" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">α</mi><mo id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">0.1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">𝛼</ci><cn type="float" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">0.1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">\alpha=0.1</annotation></semantics></math>) using ResNet-20-based models, FedMR achieves test accuracy with an average of 62.09%, while the second highest average test accuracy obtained by SCAFFOLD is only 50.46%.
Note that the performance of FedMR on FEMNIST is not as notable as the one on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
This is mainly because the classification task on FEMNIST is much simpler than the ones applied on datasets CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which leads to the high test accuracy of the six baseline methods. However, even in this case, FedMR can still achieve the best test accuracy among all the investigated FL methods.</p>

Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.3 Performance Comparison ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> presents the convergence trends
of the seven FL methods (including FedMR) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
Note that here the training of FedMR is based on our proposed
two-stage training scheme, where the first stage uses 100 FL training rounds to achieve a pre-trained model.
Here, to enable fair comparison, the test accuracy of
FedMR at some
FL training round is calculated by an intermediate global model, which is an aggregated version of all the local models within that round.
The four sub-figures show the results for different data distributions of
clients.
From this figure, we can find that FedMR outperforms the other six FL methods consistently
in both non-IID and IID scenarios. This is mainly because FedMR can easily escape from the stuck-at-local-search due to the model recombination operation in each FL round. Moreover,
due to the fine-grained training,
we can observe that the learning curves in each sub-figure are much smoother than the ones of other FL methods.
We also conducted the comparison for CNN- and VGG-16-based FL methods, and found
similar observations from them.

From Figure <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 5.4 Ablation Study ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>, we can observe that the two-stage training-based
FedMR methods (i.e., FedMR-50 and FedMR-100) achieve
the best performance from the perspectives of test accuracy and convergence rate.
Note that our two-stage training scheme can achieve a
more significant improvement on the case using
VGG-16 model, which has a much larger size than ResNet-20 model.
This is because the fine-grained FedMR without the first-stage training is not good at dealing with large-size models at the beginning of FL training, which requires much more training rounds than the coarse-grained aggregation-based methods to achieve a given preliminary
classification accuracy target.
By resorting to the two-stage training scheme,
such a slow convergence problem can be greatly
mitigated.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the coarse-grained aggregation of FedAvg as well as the
uniform client model initialization, when dealing with
uneven data distribution among clients,
existing Federated Learning (FL) methods greatly suffer from
the problem of low inference performance.
To address this problem, this paper presented a new FL paradigm named
FedMR, which enables different layers of local models to be trained on different clients.
Since FedMR supports
both fine-grained model recombination
and diversified
local training
initialization,
it enables effective and efficient search for superior generalized models for all clients. Comprehensive experimental results show both
the effectiveness and pervasiveness
of our proposed method in terms of inference accuracy and convergence rate.

Note that, only in Stage 2 of the first time of secure model recombination clients can distinguish the source of received layers. Since layers sent in Stage 3 are randomly selected, clients cannot distinguish the received layers in Stage 4 from senders or other clients.
Therefore, even if there are multiple malicious clients colluding with the cloud, it can only distinguish the source of the <math id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n_{u}" display="inline"><semantics id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">n</mi><mi id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">u</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑛</ci><ci id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑢</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">n_{u}</annotation></semantics></math> layer at most for each client.

Base on the above
analysis, we can find that FedMR does not
cause any extra communication overhead. Therefore, FedMR requires
the least communication overhead among all the investigated FL methods in each FL training round.
Note that, as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.3 Performance Comparison ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ FedMR: Federated Learning via Model Recombination" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, although FedMR
requires more rounds to achieve the highest test accuracy, to achieve the highest accuracy of other FL methods, FedMR generally requires less FL rounds.
In other words, to achieve the same test accuracy, FedMR requires much
fewer overall
communication overhead.</p>

Since all the other baselines conduct FedAvg-based aggregation, the computation overhead of the cloud server for them is similar to FedAvg.
However, since FedProx, SCAFFOLD, MOON, and FedGen require clients to conduct additional computations, their overall computing overhead is more than those of FedAvg and FedMR.</p>

<p id="A3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to traditional FedAvg-based FL methods,
FedMR does not require clients to send their data to the cloud server, thus the
data privacy can be mostly guaranteed by
the secure clients themselves.
Someone may argue that dispatching
the recombined models to adversarial
clients may expose the privacy of some clients by
attacking their specific layers.
However, since our model recombination operation breaks
the dependencies between model layers
and conducts the shuffling of layers among models, in practice
it is hard for adversaries to
restore the confidential data from
a fragmentary recombined
model without knowing the sources of layers.
Our secure recombination mechanism ensures that the cloud server only received recombined models from clients, which means the cloud server cannot restore the model of each client.</p>

<p id="A3.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a novel FL paradigm, FedMR shows much better inference
performance than most SOTA FL methods. Although this paper proposed an efficient two-stage training scheme to accelerate the overall FL training processes, there
still exists numerous
chances (e.g., client selection strategies, dynamic combination of model aggregation and model recombination operations)
to enable
further optimization on the current version of FedMR.
Meanwhile, the current version of FedMR does not take personalization into account, which is also a very important topic that is worthy of studying in the future.</p>
