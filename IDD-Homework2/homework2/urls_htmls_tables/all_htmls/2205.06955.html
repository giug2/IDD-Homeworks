<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Mass data traffics, low-latency wireless services and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have driven the emergence of a new paradigm for wireless networks, namely edge-intelligent networks, which are more efficient and flexible than traditional cloud-intelligent networks. Considering users’ privacy, model sharing-based federated learning (FL) that migrates model parameters but not private data from edge devices to a central cloud is particularly attractive for edge-intelligent networks. Due to multiple rounds of iterative updating of high-dimensional model parameters between base station (BS) and edge devices, the communication reliability is a critical issue of FL for edge-intelligent networks. We reveal the impacts of the errors generated during model broadcast and model aggregation via wireless channels caused by channel fading, interference and noise on the accuracy of FL, especially when there exists channel uncertainty. To alleviate the impacts, we propose a robust FL algorithm for edge-intelligent networks with channel uncertainty, which is formulated as a worst-case optimization problem with joint device selection and transceiver design. Finally, simulation results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are desired to support a variety of advanced wireless services, such as AR/VR, smart city, and video/audio surveillance, which generate a vast amount of data at edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In order to decrease transmission delay and communication burden, it is appealing to process these data at the network edge, but not the cloud servers. Driven by such a requirement, many researchers predict that 6G wireless networks will be edge-intelligent networks powered by the integration of edge computing and machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Actually, edge intelligence has attracted considerable interests from both academia and industry. Traditional data-sharing-based edge-intelligent networks require to convey a large volume of data from edge devices to the base station (BS) for training a global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, it not only leads to network congestion due to mass data transmission, but also causes the personal privacy leakage. With the rapid development of information technology and chip technology, the federated edge learning (FEEL) framework has been developed to address these issues, which implements distributed machine learning at the network edge (e.g., intelligent devices and the BS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In this context, model-sharing-based federated learning (FL) with the nature of privacy protection has emerged as a new branch for edge-intelligent networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Different from conventional edge intelligence supported by data sharing, FL exploits the computation capabilities of multiple intelligent devices, which are coordinated by an edge server, e.g., the BS, to cooperatively train a global model in an iterative manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Specifically, in each iteration (also called a communication round) of FL, the edge server first broadcasts the global model parameters to the devices, such that all participating devices can synchronize and initialize their local models. After that, each participating device individually trains and updates the local model based on its own dataset, and then sends the updated local model parameters to the edge server for global model aggregation. Since the whole training process of the global model only involves the transmission of model parameters rather than real raw data, FL is very appealing to edge-intelligent networks for data analysis and processing with better privacy.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the exchange of model parameters between the server and the devices is a key process of FL, the design of communication-efficient FL has received wide attention in recent years. As a leading and widely used algorithm in FL, federated averaging (FedAvg), also called model-average FL, runs stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in parallel on a portion of the total devices and obtains the global model by averaging the model parameters, which effectively reduces the number of communication rounds for global model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In particular, FedAvg has been shown to work in real-world settings by Google with their GBoard in next-word-prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and emjoi-prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Based on FedAvg, many excellent FL algorithms have emerged. For example, the federated proximal (FedProx) algorithm was proposed by adding regularization on each local loss function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Additionally, Acar et. al. introduced the federated learning with dynamic regularization (FedDyn) algorithm as a solution to heterogenous dataset setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which dynamically regularizes each devices’ loss function such that the modified device losses converge to the actual global loss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, edge devices are usually connected through long-distance wireless access. Due to limited radio resources and iterative transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters, especially when applying deep neural networks (DNNs) into model training as DNNs nowadays often have millions of parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the high communication burden is a main challenge of FL for edge-intelligent networks. To this end, some prior works attempted to solve it in various aspects. From the perspective of machine learning, it is usual to reduce the communication load by decreasing the number of participating devices or compressing the model parameters via quantization and sparsification. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a joint learning and communication framework for FL by resource allocation and device selection with the goal of minimizing an FL loss function. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, an universal vector quantization scheme for FL was put forward to effectively reduce the communication-latency. These methods from the aspect of machine learning regard wireless channels as a set of independent error-free bit-limited links between the devices and the server. In fact, the transmission of model parameters over wireless channels are inevitably affected by channel fading, interference, and noise. As a result, the performance of FL is unsatisfactory. Thus, it is necessary to develop novel transmission schemes to achieve communication-efficient FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">During the transmission of model parameters in FL, co-channel interference has a great impact. To avoid the interference and achieve accurate model aggregation, a common way is to adopt an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme, i.e., allocating an orthogonal resource block to each participating device for uploading its local model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors studied a probabilistic scheduling framework of FL based on orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Besides, energy-efficient radio resource allocation algorithms for FL over wireless fading channels supported by OMA schemes were proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Yet, such approaches substantially restrict the number of accessible devices that participate in FL under limited spectrum resources. In particular, it causes a high transmission latency and a low spectrum efficiency when the number of participating devices for FL is large, and thus is no longer applicable for edge-intelligent networks with a massive number of devices. In this context, a promising solution called <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">over-the-air computation</em> (AirComp) has been proposed and raised wide interests <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which exploits the superposition property of wireless multiple access channels (MACs) to compute a class of <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">nomographic functions</em> of distributed data from devices via concurrent transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Fortunately, the averaging method for global model aggregation in the FedAvg algorithm falls into the category of nomographic functions. Hence, it is possible to effectively enhance the learning performance by applying AirComp into model-average FL for fast model aggregation and accurate learning performance. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> developed a convergent over-the-air FL algorithm by introducing a time-varying precoding and scaling scheme. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, a novel digital over-the-air aggregation scheme was proposed to alleviate the effects of wireless channel hostilities on the convergence rate of FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve accurate model aggregation based on AirComp over fading channels, the devices need to have channel state information (CSI) to carry out channel pre-equalization. Yet, inaccurate channel estimation and hardware impairment at the devices may cause imperfect equalization, and thereby distort the aggregated model. Some works have taken into consideration the aggregation error via uplink and designed efficient schemes to improve the system performance. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> derived the trade-off between communication and learning, and proposed a broadband analog aggregation scheme for FL to reduce the communication-latency. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, a resource allocation scheme for AirComp-based on-device distributed FL system was proposed to reduce the aggregation error and improve the learning performance when the edge server was equipped with multiple antennas. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a novel AirComp-based FL system to achieve fast and reliable model aggregation by utilizing the intelligent reflecting surface to compensate for the magnitude reduction and misalignment of AirComp. However, most of exiting works for Aircomp-based FL mainly focus on the effect of parameter transmission via uplink while overlooking the impact of downlink parameters transmission for model broadcast. In fact, due to imperfect channel estimation, feedback quantization, or delay in signal acquisition on fading channels, the received model parameters at the devices may not be perfectly recovered. Such model distortion caused by unfavourable wireless transmission leads to performance degradation in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This key observation is also noted in a recent parallel work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which assumed an error-free parameter aggregation over uplink and focused on studying the impact of noisy downlink on the FL performance. Then, an analog downlink transmission approach was proposed and the convergence of FL for the proposed downlink approach was well studied. In order to compare related works more clearly, we list a comparison table to highlight the contribution of our work, cf. Table <a href="#S1.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ I-A Related Works and Motivation ‣ I Introduction ‣ Robust Design of Federated Learning for Edge-Intelligent Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. Besides, the number of participating devices at each communication round is also a critical factor of the FL performance, which has different impacts on learning and communication. On the one hand, selecting more devices to participate in FL can collect more information from distributed devices by model aggregation, which is benefit to the convergence of global model. On the other hand, the error caused by AirComp-based model aggregation via wireless transmission increases as the number of participating devices for FL increases, which in turn results in the degradation of learning performance. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the effects of the number of participating devices and the distortion of transmitted model on the performance of FL, and then design a corresponding transmission scheme for FL in edge-intelligent networks.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider a practical edge-intelligent network with imperfect CSI, inevitably leading to errors of both model aggregation and model broadcast in the training process of FL. To improve the performance of model-average FL via AirComp, we provide a robust transmission scheme for FL in edge-intelligent networks. The contributions of this paper are three-fold:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a communication-efficient FL framework for edge-intelligent networks under practical but adverse conditions, where the BS as an edge sever only has partial CSI due to imperfect channel estimation or feedback.

Specifically, the combination of the broadcast error over the downlink and the aggregation error over the uplink may lead to a notable degradation of learning performance, while the convergence of training can be accelerated with more involved devices.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We provide a robust transmission scheme with joint device selection and transceiver design to improve the performance of FL. This design is formulated as a computationally difficult combinatorial optimization problem, which maximizes the number of selected devices while satisfying the MSE requirements of model broadcast via downlink and model aggregation via uplink, respectively. Then, an effective algorithm is proposed to solve such a complicated nonconvex problem and obtain a feasible sub-optimal solution.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the following, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the commonly used MNIST dataset with the model-average FL to show the impacts of the number of selected devices, model aggregation error, and model broadcast error on the prediction accuracy. The detailed experiment setup is presented in Section IV. To simulate the model distortion caused by model aggregation and broadcast errors, we add Gaussian noise to the received models at the BS and the devices, respectively. It is seen from Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-A FL Model ‣ II System Model ‣ Robust Design of Federated Learning for Edge-Intelligent Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> that the performance gap between Benchmark (ideal situation without aggregation error and broadcast error) and the case without aggregation error is negligible. This is because broadcast error is applied to the initial local model, but the device can adjust its neural network to achieve a good training performance. However, if aggregation error exists, the effect of broadcast error aggravates the performance deterioration. Thus, it is necessary to consider both aggregation error and broadcast error in the design of FL. Moreover, it is found that the number of selected devices is also a critical factor on the prediction accuracy of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Note that the errors are mainly caused by channel fading and additive noise during model aggregation and broadcast over wireless channels. Motivated by these observations, we propose to jointly conduct device selection and transceiver design to enhance the FL performance by maximizing the number of devices participating in FL while guaranteeing aggregation error and broadcast error to be within a certain range.</p>

Hence, it makes sense to jointly perform device selection and transceiver design according to instantaneous CSI. In edge-intelligent networks, it is only able to obtain partial CSI due to imperfect channel estimation or feedback. Thus, it is necessary to take channel uncertainty into consideration for joint device selection and transceiver design, namely robust transmission scheme design. To characterize the channel uncertainty, we adopt a commonly-used deterministic CSI model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.21" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the key observations that the combination of the broadcast error over the downlink and the aggregation errors over the uplink may lead to a notable degradation of learning performance, while the convergence of training can be accelerated with more involved devices, we propose to simultaneously minimize the model distortion and maximize the number of involved devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. In particular, we propose to maximize the number of selected devices while satisfying the MSE requirements of model broadcast via downlink and model aggregation via uplink, respectively.

Thus, the proposed AO algorithm for solving the feasibility detection problem is also convergent. Moreover, based on the convergence rate analysis of AO algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, it is known that the convergence rates of the proposed algorithms both show a two-stage behavior. Specifically, at first, the error decreases q-linearly until sufficiently small. After that, the sub-linear convergence is initiated. Besides, we show the required number of iterations under various MSE requirements by simulations in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-A Performance on Parameter Transmission ‣ IV Simulation Results ‣ Robust Design of Federated Learning for Edge-Intelligent Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. It is seen that Algorithm 2 has a fast convergence speed under different conditions, which also verifies the convergence property of Algorithm 2.</p>

This is because that relaxing the condition of aggregation error at the BS can make more devices to be selected to participate in FL. Moreover, it is also found that the average number of selected devices can be increased by relaxing the MSE requirements at the devices.

Thus, it is desired to choose an appropriate number of devices under the suitable MSE requirements.</p>

The AO nonrobust algorithm is the same as the proposed robust algorithm, i.e., adopting the AO method to design adaptive transceivers according to the system requirements, except that it does not take into account of channel uncertainty. It is seen that, for a given MSE requirement at the BS, the average number of selected devices increases as the required MSE at the device increases, but the improvement is finite. Moreover, for the two nonrobust algorithms, there seems to be no regularity in their trend. This is because they design the transceivers without considering the CSI uncertainty, sometimes selecting a few devices or even no device to ensure the MSE constraints. In particular, the proposed robust algorithm has the most stable performance, while the DC nonrobust algorithm has the worst performance. That quite confirms the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed robust algorithm.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In order to testify the performance of the proposed algorithm in practical FL applications, we consider a commonly used FL task of handwritten-digit recognition using the well-known MNIST dataset that consists of 10 categories ranging from digit “0” to “9” and a total of 70,000 labeled training data samples (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). To simulate the distributed mobile data, we consider two types of data partitions, i.e., the independent andidentically distributed (IID) setting and non-IID one. For the former setting, we randomly partition the training samples into 20 equal shards, each of which is assigned to one particular device. While for the latter setting, we first sort the data by digit label, divide it into 40 shards of 1,500 images, and randomly assign 2 shards to each device. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-B Performance on FL ‣ IV Simulation Results ‣ Robust Design of Federated Learning for Edge-Intelligent Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, the training model is implemented using a 6-layer CNN that consists of two 5<math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><times id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>5 convolution layers with ReLu activation (the first with 32 channels, the second with 64 channels), each followed with 2<math id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><times id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>2 max pooling layer, a fully connected layer with 512 units and ReLu activation, and a fully connected layer with Softmax classifier as the output layer (1,663,370 total parameters) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Each device updates its local model using the SGD algorithm with a learning rate being 0.01. The cross-entropy is used as the loss function, batchsize is 64, and epoch is 1. Note that different learning tasks, datasets, and training methods will have different prediction results. In particular, our adopted benchmark FL algorithm trained by such a 6-layer CNN on MNIST dataset for image classification presents over 95% test accuracy in the ideal situation without aggregation error and broadcast error, cf.

Thus, it is fair and illustrates the performance of our proposed algorithm.</p>

compare the performance on the training loss and the test accuracy for the above three algorithms with the IID MNIST dataset and the Non-IID MNIST dataset, respectively. For the IID setting, it is seen that the proposed robust algorithm and the AO nonrobust algorithm both perform better than the DC nonrobust algorithm, and the proposed robust algorithm has a most stable and best performance on the training loss decreasing and the test accuracy increasing. For the Non-IID setting, it is found that the three algorithms all have the oscillatory waves on the performance.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have investigated the factors affecting the accuracy of FL in edge-intelligent networks. For enhancing the performance of FL, we have proposed a robust parameter transmission scheme for both model broadcast and model aggregation, which has been formulated as an optimization problem by maximizing the number of selected devices participating in FL while ensuring the required MSE constraints on model broadcast and aggregation. To solve this problem, we have resorts to some approximation methods on convex transformation and proposed an AO-based robust algorithm including sparse inducing and feasibility detection. Numerical results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for edge-intelligent networks. Moreover, it is found that whether or not the dataset is iid, the proposed robust algorithm can achieve a lower training loss and higher test accuracy compared with the nonrobust baselines.</p>
