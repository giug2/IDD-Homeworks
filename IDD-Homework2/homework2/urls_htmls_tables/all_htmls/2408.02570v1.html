<p class="ltx_p" id="id4.id1">We consider the problem of source sampling and transmission scheduling for age-of-information minimization in a system consisting of multiple energy harvesting (EH) sources and a sink node. At each time, one of the sources is selected by the scheduler and the quality of its channel to the sink is measured. This probed channel quality is then used to decide whether a source will sample an observation and transmit the packet to the sink in that time slot. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) assuming i.i.d. energy arrival and channel fading processes, and relax it using a Lagrange multiplier. We apply a near optimal Whittle’s index policy to decide the node to be probed. Next, for the probed node, we derive an optimal threshold policy, which recommends source sampling and observation transmission from the probed source only when the measured channel quality is above a threshold. Our proposed policy is called Whittle’s index and threshold based source scheduling and sampling (WITS3) policy. However, in order to calculate Whittle’s indices, one must be aware of the underlying processes’ transition matrices, which are occasionally concealed from the scheduler. Therefore, we further propose a variant Q-WITS3 of WITS3 based on Q-learning assisted by two timescale asynchronous stochastic approximation, which seeks to learn Whittle’s indices and optimal policies for the case with unknown channel states and EH characteristics. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms over two baseline policies.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Many real-time applications of wireless communication systems such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) require fresh information at the monitoring devices. To this end, the popular Age of Information (AoI) metric <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite> characterizes the freshness of information for status updates and is defined as the time elapsed since the reception of the previous update at the monitoring node.
However, two key challenges in such real-time status update systems are battery limits and limited communication bandwidth. In order to deal with the scarcity of bandwidth, multiple sources often share a common frequency band for transmitting their time-sensitive status updates to a monitoring node. On the other hand, energy harvesting source (EH) nodes can address the challenge of battery limits. However, smart scheduling policies need to be used to avoid interference among these nodes and to optimally exploit the EH feature available at the source nodes.
<br class="ltx_break"/>AoI has gained significant popularity as a network performance metric, especially for ultra-reliable low-latency communication. For example, the papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite> have proposed optimal status update policies to minimize AoI for a single EH source under various network settings; especially see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite> for age-energy trade-off and optimal threshold policy for AoI minimization, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite> for a threshold policy to minimize AoI for a single EH sensor with hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocol. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite> have proposed an age-optimal threshold policy for an RF-powered source node sending status updates to the destination considering the case where the source can either harvest energy or send data at a time. Our paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite> formulated the AoI minimization problem as an MDP for a single EH source with channel probing capability and showed that the optimal channel probing and source sampling policies exhibit threshold structure. Another paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite> from us proposed reinforcement learning algorithms to minimize AoI for an EH source working in a non-stationary environment with unknown, time-varying channel statistics and energy arrival rate.
<br class="ltx_break"/>On the other hand, AoI minimization in networks consisting of multiple source nodes contending for a shared channel has been considered too <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite>. The paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite> has considered a multi-source relaying system with
independent sources, random packet generation, buffer-aided transmitter/full-duplex relay, and error-prone links, and minimized the weighted average AoI subject to transmission constraints via CMDP formulation.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite> have considered AoI minimization over an error-free delay channel. They found that the optimal scheduling and sampling policies can be decoupled. They proposed the Maximum Age First (MAF) scheduling policy and Zero wait sampling policy to minimize the total average peak age, whereas the optimal sampling policy for minimizing the total average age turned out to be a threshold policy.
The paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite> has examined the optimal sampling and updating processes for IoT devices under sampling/updating cost, a block-fading channel, and average energy constraint. For the single source case, they proposed a threshold-type sampling and updating policy. For the multiple source case, they provided an approximate policy via Q-functions.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite> have proposed a relax-then-truncate optimal policy to minimize average on-demand AoI for a resource-constrained IoT network with a cache-enabled edge node between users and EH sensors. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite> have designed a scheduling algorithm to minimize AoI for multi-sensor network with time-varying channel states under bandwidth and power consumption constraints. They decouple the problem across sensors and propose a threshold policy for scheduling of each sensor. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite> has addressed the AoI minimization scheduling problem for a system model where a source node sends status updates to multiple users via error-prone channels under average transmission constraints. For known channel statistics, it investigated optimal scheduling policy for both automatic repeat request (ARQ) and hybrid ARQ (HARQ) protocols.
<br class="ltx_break"/>However, in order to reduce the computational complexity in solving constrained MDPs (<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p1.1.1">i.e.,</span> CMDPs) for multi-source systems, Whittle’s Index <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib16" title="">16</a>]</cite> for restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) has been widely used since it provides a near-optimal solution. Many papers have used Whittle’s Index based policy for AoI minimization problems in various multi-source scheduling systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib17" title="">17</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib18" title="">18</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib19" title="">19</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib20" title="">20</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib21" title="">21</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib22" title="">22</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib23" title="">23</a>]</cite>, but without considering energy harvesting sources and channel probing.
For example, the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib17" title="">17</a>]</cite> considered a single base station (BS)- multiple client broadcast network. For the symmetric network case, the authors showed that greedily transmitting a packet with the highest age is optimal, while for the general network case, they established that the problem is indexable and obtained Whittle’s index in closed form.

It used a Cauchy criterion to prove the optimality of Whittle’s index policy.

Different RL techniques such as UCRL2, DQN, and average-cost SARSA with LFA have been studied and compared numerically in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite> for the unknown channel statistics.

It proposed Restart Q-UCB (Q-learning with UCB) and Double Restart Q-UCB algorithms where the latter doesn’t need to know the variation budget in advance. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib26" title="">26</a>]</cite> have proposed Thompson-sampling based learning algorithm for a restless bandit system model.

Unlike the literature, our Q-WITS3 algorithm learns the Q-value functions and Whittle’s indices for a two-stage action model involving source probing and sampling decisions. Though our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.02570v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite> had considered a single source with probing capabilities and proposed a Q-learning algorithm for a two-stage action model, it did not involve Whittle’s index-based decision.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1">We study the AoI minimization problem in multiple EH source system with i.i.d. energy arrival process and i.i.d. channel at each source.
At a time, two decisions need to be made optimally: (i) which source to select for channel probing, and (ii) whether to sample and transmit the status update from the selected source based on the channel quality. We formulate this problem as a CMDP where only one source can be scheduled at a time. However, a key challenge here is the two-stage action model-probing and sampling. By using the Lagrangian relaxation method, we convert the CMDP to an unconstrained MDP and further decouple this optimization problem across sources. For the unconstrained MDP subproblems, we propose a Whittle’s index and threshold based source scheduling and sampling policy (WITS3 policy) where, at each time, the source node having the highest Whittle’s index is probed, and sampled based on the channel probe outcome. We prove that, for each decoupled MDP sub-problem,
the optimal sampling policy amounts to checking whether the probed channel quality is above a threshold.</p>

In contrast to the standard Q-learning algorithm which takes a single action at each time instant, we basically combine WITS3 and Q-learning that seeks to learn the Q-values and Whittle’s indices under the two-stage action model. It is important to note that the algorithm involves two timescale asynchronous stochastic approximation; the Q-values are updated in the faster timescale and the Whittle’s indices are updated at a slower timescale.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">We, in this paper, have considered the AoI minimization problem for multiple EH source system where EH sources send their status updates to a destination node over a common wireless medium. Under a source probing constraint,
we have proposed a Whittle’s index and threshold based source scheduling and sampling policy (WITS3 policy)
which uses Whittle’s index for selecting a node for source probing, and further uses a channel quality threshold based rule for sampling and communication. Also, we have proposed a novel Q-WITS3 algorithm that computes the optimal source scheduling and sampling policy for the unknown environment case. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of WITS3 and also demonstrate that the Q-WITS3 algorithm asymptotically learns the same policy as returned by WITS3. In future, we will extend this work to the multi-sink, multi-hop setting.</p>
