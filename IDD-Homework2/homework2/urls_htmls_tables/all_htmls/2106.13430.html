<p id="id21.id1" class="ltx_p">Graphs have been widely used in data mining and machine learning due to their unique representation of real-world objects and their interactions. As graphs are getting bigger and bigger nowadays, it is common to see their subgraphs separately collected and stored in multiple local systems. Therefore, it is natural to consider the <span id="id21.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">subgraph federated learning</span> setting, where each local system holds a <span id="id21.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">small</span> subgraph that may be <span id="id21.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">biased</span> from the distribution of the whole graph. Hence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively train a powerful and generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing their graph data. In this work, towards the novel yet realistic setting of subgraph federated learning, we propose two major techniques: (1) FedSage, which trains a GraphSage model based on FedAvg to integrate node features, link structures, and task labels on multiple local subgraphs; (2) FedSage+, which trains a missing neighbor generator along FedSage to deal with missing links across local subgraphs. Empirical results on four real-world graph datasets with synthesized subgraph federated learning settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques. At the same time, consistent theoretical implications are made towards their generalization ability on the global graphs.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Graph mining leverages links among connected nodes in graphs to conduct inference. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained applause with impressing performance and generalizability in many graph mining tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Similar to machine learning tasks in other domains, attaining a well-performed GNN model requires its training data to not only be sufficient but also follow the similar distribution as general queries.
While in reality, data owners often collect limited and biased graphs and cannot observe the global distribution. With heterogeneous subgraphs separately stored in local data owners, accomplishing a globally applicable GNN requires collaboration.</p>

For example, FL has been devised in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) to allow the joint training of powerful and generalizable deep convolutional neural networks and language models on separately stored datasets of images and texts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Motivating Scenario.</span> Taking the healthcare system as an example, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Subgraph Federated Learning with Missing Neighbor Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, residents of a city may go to different hospitals for various reasons. As a result, their healthcare data, such as demographics and living conditions, as well as patient interactions, such as co-staying in a sickroom and co-diagnosis of a disease, are stored only within the hospitals they visit. When any healthcare problem is to be studied in the whole city, <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, the prediction of infections when a pandemic occurs, a single powerful graph mining model is needed to conduct effective inference over the entire global patient network, which contains all subgraphs from different hospitals. However, it is rather difficult to let all hospitals share their patient networks with others to train the graph mining model due to conflicts of interests.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In such scenarios, it is desirable to train a powerful and generalizable graph mining model over multiple distributed subgraphs without actual data sharing. However, this novel yet realistic setting brings two unique technical challenges, which have never been explored so far.</p>

Training a separate graph mining model on each subgraph may not capture the global data distribution and is also prone to overfitting. Moreover, it is unclear how to integrate multiple graph mining models into a universally applicable one that can handle any queries from the underlying global graph.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Solution 1: FedSage: Training GraphSage with FedAvg.</span> To attain a powerful and generalizable graph mining model from small and biased subgraphs distributed in multiple local owners, we develop a framework of subgraph federated learning, specifically, with the vanilla mechanism of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. As for the graph mining model, we resort to GraphSage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, due to its advantages of inductiveness and scalability.

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenge 2: How to deal with missing links across local subgraphs?</span> Unlike distributed systems in other domains such as CV and NLP, whose data samples of images and texts are isolated and independent, data samples in graphs are connected and correlated.
Most importantly, in a subgraph federated learning system, data samples in each subgraph can potentially have connections to those in other subgraphs. These connections carrying important information of node neighborhoods and serving as bridges among the data owners, however, are never directly captured by any data owner.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Solution 2: FedSage+: Generating missing neighbors along FedSage.</span>
To deal with cross-subgraph missing links, we add a missing neighbor generator on top of FedSage and propose a novel FedSage+ model.
Specifically, for each data owner, instead of training the GraphSage model on the original subgraph, it first mends the subgraph with generated cross-subgraph missing neighbors and then applies FedSage on the mended subgraph. To obtain the missing neighbor generator, each data owner impairs the subgraph by randomly holding out some nodes and related links and then trains the generator based on the held-out neighbors. Training the generator on an individual local subgraph enables it to generate potential missing links within the subgraph. Further training the generator in our subgraph FL setting allows it to generate missing neighbors across distributed subgraphs.

<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct experiments on four real-world datasets with different numbers of data owners to better simulate the application scenarios. According to our results, both of our models outperform locally trained classifiers in all scenarios. Compared to FedSage, FedSage+ further promotes the performance of the outcome classifier. Further in-depth model analysis shows the convergence and generalization ability of our frameworks, which is corroborated by our theoretical analysis in the end.</p>

One of the most frequently applied tasks on graph data is node classification.
Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs), <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, graph convolutional networks (GCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and GraphSage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, improved the state-of-the-art in node classification with their elegant yet powerful designs. However, as GNNs leverage the homophily of nodes in both node features and link structures to conduct the inference, they are vulnerable to the perturbation on graphs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.
Robust GNNs, aiming at reducing the degeneration in GNNs caused by graph perturbation, are gaining attention these days. Current robust GNNs focus on the sensitivity towards modifications on node features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> or adding/removing edges on the graph <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. However, neither of these two types recapitulates the missing neighbor problem, which affects both the feature distribution and structure distribution.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To obtain a node classifier with good generalizability, the development of domain adaptive GNN sheds light on adapting a GNN model trained on the source domain to the target domain by leveraging underlying structural consistency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
However, in the distributed system we consider, data owners have subgraphs with heterogeneous feature and structure distributions. Moreover, direct information exchanges among subgraphs, such as message passing, are fully blocked due to the missing cross-subgraph links. The violation of the domain adaptive GNNs’ assumptions on alignable nodes and cross-domain structural consistency denies their usage in the distributed subgraph system.</p>

FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is an efficient and well-studied FL method. Similar to most FL methods, it is originally proposed for traditional machine learning problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to allow collaborative training on silo data through local updating and global aggregation. The ecently proposed meta-learning framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> that exploits information from different data sources to obtain a general model attracts FL researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
However, meta-learning aims to learn general models that easily adapt to different local tasks, while we learn a generalizable model from diverse data owners to assist in solving a global task.
In the distributed subgraph system, to obtain a globally applicable model without sharing local graph data, we borrow the idea of FL to collaboratively train GNNs.</p>

It considers a different scenario assuming subgraphs have overlapped items (nodes), and the user-item interactions (edges) are distributed but completely stored in the system, which ignores the possible cross-subgraph information lost in real-world scenarios.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct comprehensive ablation experiments to verify the significant promotion brought by FedSage and FedSage+ for local owners in global node classification, as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2 Experimental results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Subgraph Federated Learning with Missing Neighbor Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The most important observation emerging from the results is that FedSage+ not only clearly outperforms LocSage by an average of 23.18%, but also distinctly overcomes the cross-subgraph missing neighbor problem by reducing the average accuracy drop from the 2.11% of FedSage to 1.28%, when compared with GlobSage (absolute accuracy difference).</p>

Compared to FedSage, the further elevation brought by FedSage+ corroborates the assumed degeneration brought by missing cross-subgraph links and the effectiveness of our innovatively designed NeighGen module. Notably, when the graph is relatively sparse (<span id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, see Citeseer in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Datasets and experimental settings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Subgraph Federated Learning with Missing Neighbor Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), FedSage+ significantly exhibits its robustness in resisting the cross-subgraph information loss compared to FedSage. Note that the gaps between LocSage and LocSage+ are comparatively smaller, indicating that our NeighGen serves more than a robust GNN trainer, but is rather uniquely crucial in the subgraph FL setting.</p>

For the studied scenario, each data owner only possesses about 20% of the nodes with rather biased label distributions, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Overall performance. ‣ 5.2 Experimental results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Subgraph Federated Learning with Missing Neighbor Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (a).
Such bias is due to the way we synthesize the distributed subgraph system with Louvain clustering, which is also realistic in real scenarios. Local bias essentially makes it hard for any local data owner with limited training samples to obtain a generalized classifier that is globally useful.
Although with 13.9% of the links missing among the system, both FedSage and FedSage+ empower local data owners in predicting labels that closely follow the ground-true global label distribution as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Overall performance. ‣ 5.2 Experimental results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Subgraph Federated Learning with Missing Neighbor Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (b).

FedSage, FedSage+, GlobSage, LocSage and LocSage+. The results are presented in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ Overall performance. ‣ 5.2 Experimental results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Subgraph Federated Learning with Missing Neighbor Generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Both FedSage and FedSage+ can consistently achieve convergence with rapidly improved testing accuracy. Regarding runtime, even though the classifier from FedSage+ learns from distributed mended subgraphs, FedSage+ does not consume observable more training time compared to FedSage. Due to the additional communications and computations in subgraph FL, both FedSage and FedSage+ consume slightly more training time compared to GlobSage.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work aims at obtaining a generalized node classification model in a distributed subgraph system without direct data sharing. To tackle the realistic yet unexplored issue of missing cross-subgraph links, we design a novel missing neighbor generator NeighGen with the corresponding local and federated training processes. Experimental results evidence the distinguished elevation brought by our FedSage and FedSage+ frameworks
, which is consistent with our theoretical implications. </p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Though FedSage manifests advantageous performance, it confronts additional communication cost and potential privacy concerns. As communications are vital for federated learning, properly reducing communication and rigorously guaranteeing privacy protection in the distributed subgraph system can both be promising future directions.</p>

<p id="A4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we provide in-depth NeighGen studies to empirically explain its power in the cross-subgraph missing neighbor generation. Specifically, we first show the intermediate results of NeighGen by boiling down the generation process into the missing cross-subgraph link generation by dGen and the missing cross-subgraph neighbor feature generation by fGen. Next, we experimentally verify the necessity of training locally specialized NeighGen. Finally, we provide FL training hyper-parameter study on batch size and local epoch to emphasize the robustness of FedSage+.</p>

In principle, due to the expressiveness of FNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, dGen and fGen with even very few layers have the power to approximate complex functions.

Both FedSage and FedSage+, where every data owner samples on a limited subgraph, fit better in batch sizes 16.
