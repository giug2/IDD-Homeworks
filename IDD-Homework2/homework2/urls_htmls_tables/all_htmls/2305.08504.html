<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Intelligent, large-scale IoT ecosystems have become possible due to recent advancements in sensing technologies, distributed learning, and low-power inference in embedded devices. In traditional cloud-centric approaches, raw data is transmitted to a central server for training and inference purposes. On the other hand, Federated Learning migrates both tasks closer to the edge nodes and endpoints. This allows for a significant reduction in data exchange while preserving the privacy of users. Trained models, though, may under-perform in dynamic environments due to changes in the data distribution, affecting the model’s ability to infer accurately; this is referred to as concept drift. Such drift may also be adversarial in nature. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to detect such behaviours promptly. In order to simultaneously reduce communication traffic and maintain the integrity of inference models, we introduce FLARE, a novel lightweight dual-scheduler FL framework that conditionally transfers training data, and deploys models between edge and sensor endpoints based on observing the model’s training behaviour and inference statistics, respectively. We show that FLARE can significantly reduce the amount of data exchanged between edge and sensor nodes compared to fixed-interval scheduling methods (over 5x reduction), is easily scalable to larger systems, and can successfully detect concept drift reactively with at least a 16x reduction in latency.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been widely deployed across various industrial and non-industrial environments to enhance and maintain different services. These include critical applications in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, manufacturing and product life cycles, warehouse inventory management, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In the majority of these cases, IoT devices must meet real-time performance and deployment constraints such as low power, small physical size, low manufacturing costs and low installation complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the past, IoT data were processed in a centralised ML architecture. When considering the data exchange cost and the ever-growing number of IoT devices, results in centralised ML becoming prohibitively expensive. Therefore, distributed ML architectures such as the Federated Learning (FL) frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> are now commonly used. Data collected by IoT sensors is sent to Edge devices for training or inference. In an FL setup, multiple edge devices locally train their models and later share them with a central parameter server to be aggregated into a global model. This global model is later sent back to the edge devices for continued learning. In such a setup, the system is able to reap the benefits of models trained from rich data while preserving data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In IoT systems, embedded microcontrollers were traditionally used only for sensing purposes such as light, temperature and humidity measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Akin to advances in edge processing technologies, these embedded devices are becoming increasingly more powerful and capable of running ML inference tasks while still generating and processing the raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Typically, a pre-trained model is converted into its embedded format and deployed on the resource-constrained embedded sensors. This significantly reduces the data exchange in the entire system and enhances the system’s scalability and efficiency while reducing the cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, real-world systems, being highly dynamic environments, introduce significant challenges in the pre-trained ML models. ML models, as the underlying relationship between the input (e.g., sensing data) and output (target) variables changes over time, become outdated and their performance drops. This behaviour is called concept drift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and can occur for several reasons, e.g., long-term climate changes, short-term sensor drift, etc. Concept drift can also result from adversarial attacks, such as data poisoning attacks which can be even more detrimental for FL deployments. Even if one node is attacked in an FL setup and its data is poisoned, the attack can disperse across all other clients as all models are aggregated to a single global one.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Concept drift is mitigated against with frequent retraining of the model with recent data and non-poisoned data. In the IoT context, even though embedded devices are capable of performing inference tasks, training is usually conducted on the edge. Thus, there is always a tradeoff between the data exchanged and the expected model performance that should be considered, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Considering all the above, we present Federated LeArning with REactive monitoring of concept drift (FLARE), a novel scheduling method of ensuring sustained model performance while minimising the communication overhead in a cloud-edge-endpoint continuum.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">ML models typically require training with large amounts of data before they can be deployed for inference. Training data would provide a good representation of the data collected at inference time. However, when the environment is dynamic, the data distribution changes over time, leading to a deterioration in the trained model’s accuracy. This change in data distribution during inference time is known as concept drift and is especially detrimental to long-term ML deployments if poorly maintained <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. There are several types of concept drift, and previous work in the literature has included different methods in categorising them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Concept drift problems are often addressed through statistical methods, such as comparing a statistic representing the similarity between two data sets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Concept drift on centralised continuous architectures can affect the long-term accuracy of one single model. However, concept drift on distributed decentralised continuous learning systems will affect the entire system, including every edge node. In the case of FL, a change in distribution at one of the sensors (data poisoning) would directly impact other local models. Therefore, it is imperative to detect concept drift for large-scale FL deployments. Previous work has explored the effects of concept drift for FL and continual settings, however, they require specific conditions. For example, CDA-FedAvg detects drift during training and thus requires the availability of drifted labels which runs the risk of missing drift<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Hassan Mehmood et al. presented a method of detecting concept drift using time series data but did not consider the model drift itself <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, the detection methods rely on absolute confidence values or differences between previous and current confidence values. DNNs often provide highly confident predictions that can be inaccurate and unreliable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Our proposed methods (detailed below) rely on the change in the distribution of the confidence values under different conditions, providing a more reliable and efficient approach for resource-constrained devices.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper, based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, proposes FLARE, which incorporates two scheduling subsystems for deployment on training nodes (e.g., a cloud server in centralised or clients in federated systems) and sensors (low power, computationally constrained embedded devices).
The proposed solution, therefore, consists of two schedulers, one placed at the client and another at the sensor. This work concentrates on deploying this approach in a federated learning setting. These two subsystems can be implemented and deployed independently, but since both methods complement each other, we deploy them in tandem to effectively optimise overall data communication. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FLARE: Detection and Mitigation of Concept Drift for Federated Learning based IoT Deployments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the architectural diagram of the entire system when used in an FL environment. It consists of a server where a global model is initialised and shared among clients for training. Clients contain processing units (such as GPUs) to train ML models (represented as their AI core at the edge) with their local datasets and produce individual local models. These local models are continuously shared with the server for aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our first proposed scheduler observes model training and assesses when the model is ready to be deployed for inference.

During inference, the model’s confidences are observed with the second scheduler that decides whether the model has drifted. In the case of drift detection, a mitigation strategy is shared; in this case, data is shared with the client for training the model with the latest data. Details of both the proposed scheduling schemes are provided below.</p>

At the client, local models are trained after receiving an initial global model from the <span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">server</span>.
Our proposed scheduler system runs within the client to evaluate model stability during training.
This is achieved using a subset of the training data to validate the model’s stability.
The losses of the training and validation sets can be calculated using the local model trained on the client.
Model stability is determined by comparing the standard deviation of the absolute loss differences using the two sets and the mean of the absolute loss difference.</p>

<p id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to observe model quality at the sensor node where raw data is collected, the method proposed compares the confidence values generated using the confidence validation set and the test sets. This is done using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> that compares the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received confidence values with the CDF of the confidence values generated from the test set.
By evaluating the similarity of the client test confidences and sensor test confidences, two possible decisions can be made, <em id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i)</em> If the similarity is low, indicating there is a change in the distribution of the sensor test set (for example, due to the addition of noise), the sensor then sends new raw data to the client for further training (in supervised learning, this data would also require labelling), and <em id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ii)</em> If the similarity is high, indicating the deployed model is still effective for the current data set, the sensor can continue inference without transferring any new data to the client.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We benchmark FLARE in two different scenarios. For both experiments, we assume: a) deploying a model on the sensor, and b) transferring the data from sensors to the clients; both at fixed intervals. We begin with a preliminary study comprised of one sensor and one client, and compare it against a fixed scheduler and a setup with no scheduling method. We later investigate a more real-world-like scenario (4 clients, 32 sensors) comparing FLARE against two fixed interval schedulers, i.e., high- and low-frequency schemes. Our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are classification accuracy, communication volume, and drift detection latency.</p>

MNIST Corrupted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> dataset is well suited for such drifts containing 15 types of corruptions applied on handwritten digits. We chose three, i.e., <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Zigzag</span>, <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Canny edges</span>, and <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Glass blur</span> (Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Sensor ‣ IV Methodology ‣ FLARE: Detection and Mitigation of Concept Drift for Federated Learning based IoT Deployments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) and introduce them at the sensor’s data with fixed intervals after the initial deployment (mainly once the model is trained for a fixed initialisation period).
For drift mitigation, we assumed these changes in data are benign in nature and as such are incorporated as new data for training within the FL system.
All the different sub-datasets in the client and sensor are set to a fixed size to keep the data distribution consistent, and our evaluation focused on the system’s ability to detect and mitigate concept drift.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep CNNs are known to perform well in image classification problems. However, due to the hardware constraints on embedded devices, a very deep CNN model is not typically optimal. As such, we opted for a basic CNN architecture (with two convolutional layers with max-pooling followed by two Dense layers; all with Relu activation function and softmax in the final layer). That can easily be optimised for embedded devices whilst still retaining high accuracy. We used a Gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1 (fixed across all of the experiments).</p>

Our results show that the accuracy using FLARE recovers well after every new introduction of corrupted images. This indicates the system is able to detect, re-train, and re-deploy without manual intervention. In the case of no scheduler, significant performance deterioration of the model is observed. When compared to the accuracy perceived at the sensor with a fixed interval scheme, FLARE scheduling closely matches it but does not follow it completely. This is due to the higher frequency of communications, as seen in Figure <a href="#S4.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ Sensor ‣ IV Methodology ‣ FLARE: Detection and Mitigation of Concept Drift for Federated Learning based IoT Deployments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3b</span></a>. In this, we essentially demonstrate that it is not required to constantly communicate data between the client and the sensor. Instead, conditional communication can significantly reduce the total data transferred. It is important to note that sending raw data is considerably more costly than re-deploying a model. Therefore, simply limiting the transfer of raw data already drastically reduces the total data transferred.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For FLARE, we observe a consistent accuracy with no more than 18% maximum drop. This is comparable to the 17.5% drop in a high-frequency fixed interval scheduler but much lower than the 32.5% seen in the low-frequency setup. Both high and low fixed schedulers are able to further recover to a 12.5% and 14.5% difference in accuracy after several more deployments, but FLARE recovers to a final accuracy difference of 10.2%.
Interestingly, as shown in Figure  <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI Results ‣ FLARE: Detection and Mitigation of Concept Drift for Federated Learning based IoT Deployments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the drift effect in the sensors of client 1 does not carry to the other sensors in other clients. Small fluctuations in accuracy are likely due to the FL training at the clients.</p>

<div id="S6.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, to evaluate the amount of data transmitted in such a multi-sensor/client setup, we first compared the cumulative data transferred between client 1 and the affected sensor; essentially isolating the affected nodes from the FL system. We then compared the data transmitted between the three schedulers in the 4 clients/32 sensors setup.
By plotting the data communicated between client 1 and the affected sensor, shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ VI-A Preliminary FL Experiment ‣ VI Results ‣ FLARE: Detection and Mitigation of Concept Drift for Federated Learning based IoT Deployments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5a</span></a>, FLARE performs similarly to the low-frequency scheduler but transmits much less than the high-frequency method.
However, if we consider all the data transmitted in the entire FL system, which includes 4 clients and 32 sensors, the proposed scheduling scheme shows a significant reduction,
as shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-A Preliminary FL Experiment ‣ VI Results ‣ FLARE: Detection and Mitigation of Concept Drift for Federated Learning based IoT Deployments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
Furthermore, since both fixed scheduling schemes regularly communicate, they are unsuitable for longer-term deployments where data communication volume is linearly increasing.
The above demonstrate the scalability of FLARE, because, as shown, the amount of data transferred does not change significantly as the length of the experiment increases.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although our system presents a compelling set of methods for reducing data communication by detecting and reacting to drift in an FL architecture, there are several areas where it could be further optimised.
Currently, FLARE uses fixed thresholds for detecting drift as well as regulating the frequency of communications. This method demonstrates the potential of our system and the need for similar systems within such FL architectures.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, further automated optimisation techniques based on the dataset can also be developed considering various factors such as available data rates.
In the future, we envision developing adaptive thresholding schemes, which will also enable generalisation to other types of data sets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. One potential method for an adaptive threshold implementation would be to use an observation window during run-time to monitor the models and set thresholds adaptively. This would allow the system to set appropriate thresholds depending on the state of training.</p>

For dealing with other types of drift, such as gradual or incremental <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, further experiments will be required either using existing datasets that present such behaviours or synthetically generating drift on existing datasets. The proposed system may also require additional research to be able to optimally detect these types of drifts, however, it must still be able to perform in a lightweight manner for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed detection and mitigation algorithms for distributed learning and deployment systems when they are exposed to dynamic environments, and as such, are subject to concept drift. The main aim of this work was to both detect and react to these changes in an optimised, scalable and timely manner. The proposed methods not only help such a system recover from performance deterioration when exposed to data distribution changes but does it with minimal data communication. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our proposed solution, FLARE, under FL deployments of varying scales, as well as benchmarked against the baseline fixed scheduling methods by comparing accuracy, drift detection latency and data communication volume. When compared against fixed interval schedulers, our proposed solution is able to achieve similar levels of accuracy whilst keeping data transfer to a minimum. FLARE, also has a lower detection latency compared to fixed interval scheduling schemes.</p>
