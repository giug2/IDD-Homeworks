<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables distributed model training from local data collected by users. In distributed systems with constrained resources and potentially high dynamics, e.g., mobile edge networks, the efficiency of FL is an important problem. Existing works have separately considered different configurations to make FL more efficient, such as infrequent transmission of model updates, client subsampling, and compression of update vectors. However, an important open problem is how to jointly apply and tune these control knobs in a single FL algorithm, to achieve the best performance by allowing a high degree of freedom in control decisions. In this paper, we address this problem and propose <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FlexFL</span> – an FL algorithm with multiple options that can be adjusted flexibly. Our FlexFL algorithm allows both arbitrary rates of local computation at clients and arbitrary amounts of communication between clients and the server, making both the computation and communication resource consumption adjustable. We prove a convergence upper bound of this algorithm. Based on this result, we further propose a stochastic optimization formulation and algorithm to determine the control decisions that (approximately) minimize the convergence bound, while conforming to constraints related to resource consumption. The advantage of our approach is also verified using experiments.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many emerging applications nowadays are driven by machine learning technologies. To train models that are used in such applications, a large training dataset is usually needed. However, it has become increasingly common that data are collected and stored by local users at their end devices or organizational servers. It is difficult to share such data with a central entity, due to privacy regulations and communication bandwidth limitation. As a result, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">federated learning (FL)</span> has emerged as a promising technique for distributed model training from decentralized local datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At its core, FL includes model updates at each client (e.g., user device) using its own local data and aggregation of model parameters through a server (e.g., a cloud instance). In a resource-constrained system, such as a mobile edge network, these FL operations consume both computation and communication resources. Therefore, an important research direction is <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to make the most efficient use of the limited resources to maximize the performance of FL</span>. Some recent works have considered this problem by tuning configuration parameters of the FL algorithm, such as the number of local updates in each FL round, participation rate of clients, and compression rate of parameters transmitted between clients and the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, the vast majority of them only focus on adjusting a small subset of all the available control options in FL, which cannot achieve the full potential of making FL the most efficient. In particular, the automatic adaptation of both parameter compression (e.g., sparsification and quantization) and partial client participation has not been studied, to the best of our knowledge. There is also usually a tight coupling between computation and communication in existing works, which may be difficult to achieve in heterogeneous systems where the costs of different resources can vary over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In light of these limitations, there is an important open problem: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Is it possible to jointly apply a wide range of control options in a single FL algorithm, to support heterogeneous and time-varying costs<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note"><span id="footnote1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">1</span></span><span id="footnote1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">We consider the resource </span><span id="footnote1.6" class="ltx_text">cost</span><span id="footnote1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright"> as a generic metric in this paper, which can be defined as related to the availability of each type of resource.</span></span></span></span> of multiple types of resources?</span>
There are several challenges in answering this question. <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">1)</span> It is non-straightforward to design an FL algorithm that allows simultaneous adjustment of multiple configurations with a high degree of freedom. <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2)</span> It is difficult to analyze and understand the influence of different control options and the interplay between them on the FL performance. <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">3)</span> It is challenging to design an efficient control algorithm to automatically determine the best configurations subject to various constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we address this problem by proposing <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FlexFL</span>, which is an FL algorithm that includes flexible control knobs that can be adjusted based on computation and communication costs. In essence, FlexFL includes three components: <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">1)</span> partial computation at clients, <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2)</span> compressed parameter transmission from each client to the server, and <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">3)</span> compressed parameter transmission from the server to clients. Each of these components includes its own controllable parameter to define the rate of computation (for the first component) or communication (for the second and third components).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There are several key characteristics in FlexFL. First, the amount of computation and the amount of communication are <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">decoupled</span> and can be controlled separately, allowing a high degree of freedom in control decisions to suit the current costs of different types of resources. Second, both the computation and communication rates can vary over time and they can be different for different clients and the server, which allows a high degree of <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">system heterogeneity</span> and flexible resource usage depending on time-varying costs.
Third, FlexFL includes the special case of <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiple local computations<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note"><span id="footnote2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">2</span></span><span id="footnote2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">In FlexFL, clients may perform multiple local computations (updates) with different mini-batches on the same local model parameter, and do not immediately update the parameter. This is slightly different from local updates done in the FL literature, but conceptually both approaches share similarities.</span></span></span></span></span> by setting the communication rate to zero in certain rounds.
Moreover, FlexFL and its analysis also allow <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">statistical heterogeneity</span>, i.e., non-i.i.d. data across clients, which is commonly observed in practical FL scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We also present a convergence analysis of our FlexFL algorithm for general non-convex objectives. The resulting convergence bound provides important insights. In particular, we reveal that the convergence error increases in the residual error and decreases in the participation (computation) rate, where the residual error captures the gap between the transmitted model parameter and the computed local parameter (at each client) or received aggregated parameter (at the server).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we formulate our control problem as <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stochastic optimization</span> over a finite time horizon, which makes decisions on the computation and communication rates over time, to minimize the convergence error subject to time-averaged cost constraints. We propose a <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">distributed</span> and <span id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">online</span> algorithm
to approximately solve this problem.
In addition, we conduct a thorough analysis of this control algorithm and discuss its important properties and insights, based on which we explain how to balance constraint satisfaction and optimality, and also give closed-form solutions for a class of costs.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the past few years, efforts have been made to make FL resource-efficient, using techniques such as computing multiple local updates between communication rounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, transmitting compressed (sparse or quantized) model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and allowing only a small subset of clients to participate in each FL round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. A large body of these works focuses on analyzing the convergence behavior of these algorithms, but the study of multiple local computations with partial client participation has been largely separate from compression. To our knowledge, there does not exist work that incorporates both partial client participation and the special case of no transmission (similar to multiple local computations) with general (possibly biased) compressors.</p>

This shows that the client-to-server communication is the main bottleneck with the current choice of cost and constraint parameters.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.6" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed FlexFL and its online control algorithm. FlexFL has a set of flexible control knobs to adjust the amount of computation and communication. It includes no communication as a special case and randomly decides whether to compute in each iteration according to an adjustable probability, therefore supporting multiple local computations and partial participation. By analyzing its convergence, we have provided a theoretical foundation on how the amount of computation and communication affect the model training performance. Accordingly, we have proposed a control algorithm to automatically determine the configuration parameters of FlexFL subject to time-averaged cost constraints.
