<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Data privacy and silos are nontrivial and greatly challenging in many real-world applications. Federated learning is a decentralized approach to training models across multiple local clients without the exchange of raw data from client devices to global servers.
However, existing works focus on a static data environment and ignore continual learning from streaming data with incremental tasks.
Federated Continual Learning (FCL) is an emerging paradigm to address model learning in both federated and continual learning environments. The key objective of FCL is to fuse heterogeneous knowledge from different clients and retain knowledge of previous tasks while learning on new ones.
In this work, we delineate federated learning and continual learning first and then discuss their integration, i.e., FCL, and particular FCL via knowledge fusion. In summary, our motivations are four-fold: we (1) raise a fundamental problem called “spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting” and evaluate its impact on the performance using a well-known method called federated averaging (FedAvg), (2) integrate most of the existing FCL methods into two generic frameworks, namely synchronous FCL and asynchronous FCL, (3) categorize a large number of methods according to the mechanism involved in knowledge fusion, and finally (4) showcase an outlook on the future work of FCL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning has been instrumental in the advances of both data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The algorithms have also been successfully used in almost all areas of applications in industry, science, and engineering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, traditional deep learning algorithms often require large amounts of training data and centralized training, which are usually impractical or even impossible in practical situations. For example, in the case of mobile devices, it is difficult to collect and transfer large amounts of data to a central server with limited bandwidth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Centralized training is also infeasible due to data privacy and data silos because of the information security, related laws and regulations, and intensive competition among technology giants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In recent years, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a positive response to the increasing need for privacy and other concerns in machine learning applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This newly emerging paradigm deploys multiple devices to train a global model collaboratively by uploading their models to a server while keeping the private data locally, as opposed to the traditional centralized data storage and model training approach. FL mainly involves privacy preservation, knowledge transfer, and collaboration among data owners, which are essential for many real-world applications of AI. After several years of development, FL has produced promising results, particularly in industries that handle sensitive data such as finance, healthcare, electronic communication and government affairs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its numerous advantages, FL confronts significant challenges. The first challenge is the lack of dynamism. The setting assumptions of most existing FL methods are somewhat strong, assuming all data and classes should be known prior and will be unchanged forever. It contradicts the dynamic nature of the real world, where data are collected in streams and the data could form sequential tasks.
However, traditional FL would suffer from terribly temporal catastrophic forgetting (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TemporalCF</span>) when local models learning on new tasks. <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TemporalCF</span> is a major challenge in Continual Learning (CL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which refers to changes in crucial parameters of a single model when learning on consecutive tasks, resulting in poor performance on previous tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Apparently, FL would certainly encounter <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TemporalCF</span> if each client learns on a sequence of tasks from a private local data stream.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another challenge of FL is data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, also known as non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. It refers to the differences in data distributions, feature spaces and labels across clients participating in the federated training process, aroused by variations in the data sources, data collection methods, data quality, etc. Data heterogeneity results in diverse knowledge extracted by local models. Knowledge of a model is often represented by parameters. The more different the data, the greater the parameter divergence. Simply aggregating these local models, like averaging parameters, can lead to critical parameters for certain local tasks being overwritten. Such that the aggregated global model may perform worse than the local models on the local test set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. We call this phenomenon spatial catastrophic forgetting (<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SpatialCF</span>). It is worth noting that <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SpatialCF</span> is a new concept we introduce in this paper, which is analogical to the <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TemporalCF</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Continual Learning (FCL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> breaks the static limitations of traditional federated learning on each client learning a task sequence. Beyond FL and CL, FCL has a fundamental problem called <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting</span>. On the local side, clients need to overcome <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TemporalCF</span> induced by learning new tasks. On the server side, the server must address <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SpatialCF</span> caused by aggregating different local models. Specifically, after completing the training of a task, the server aggregates local models into a global model. Then the clients use the global model as a foundational model for continual learning of the next task. Therefore, <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SpatialCF</span> may exacerbate <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TemporalCF</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we enumerate several FCL algorithms profoundly to explore how they overcome spatial/temporal catastrophic forgetting or both. We evaluate them with extensive experiments and show that the training process of FCL is essentially a sort of knowledge fusion: fuse knowledge of previous tasks with current task’s knowledge, as well as fuse heterogeneous knowledge from different clients. Specifically speaking, since uploading the entire local parameters or gradients to the server may cause privacy leakages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and slow down the aggregation due to the large communication cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, FCL methods typically extract knowledge during local training, upload the extraction of local knowledge and explore more efficient model aggregation strategies.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the rapid development of network technology and AI has brought about a growing concern regarding the potential risks of privacy disclosure. As citizens and companies become increasingly aware of personal privacy and data ownership, governments have taken measures to address privacy risks and security threats <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Notably, the European Union issued the General Data Protection Regulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> in 2018, which represents the first bill on data privacy protection. In May 2019, San Francisco banned the use of face recognition by government agencies to eliminate the hidden dangers caused by technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In addition to laws and regulations, information asymmetry, an important factor in improving competitiveness, is also against the needs of traditional deep learning for centralized data storage and processing. On the one hand, many data are of poor quality and lack labels, while on the other hand, data are scattered across various data subjects and enterprises, creating data silos that cannot be connected <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In brief, there is an insoluble dilemma of protecting data privacy and breaking data silos in the traditional centralized machine learning paradigm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL has been proposed as a potential solution to this dilemma <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. FL is a distributed learning approach where multiple devices or nodes collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. It originated from FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which allows each client to use local data to train their own local model, then local models will be aggregated as a global model by weighted average based on the proportion of data, the global model will then be distributed to clients who take part in aggregation and help to train a new initial model in the next round of communication. The core idea of FL is to break down data silos while preventing privacy breaches by fusing extracted knowledge, instead of raw data, of edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Since then, various FL algorithms have been proposed. However, recent studies have evidently shown that uploading full gradients to the server fails to protect the raw data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposes Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG), an algorithm that can obtain original local data from publicly shared gradients.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> shows that the ground-truth labels can be extracted with 100% accuracy under DLG attack. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> demonstrates the feasibility of reconstructing images at high resolution from the knowledge of uploaded parameter gradients. Other forms of attacks also pose threats to the security and privacy of FL. Attacks conducted during the inference phase are called evasion or exploratory attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> firstly devised an active inference attack called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) attack against deep FL models. It allows the adversarial participant to train a GAN to generate prototypical samples of the targeted private training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To further enhance privacy protection, researchers have explored alternative information forms to exchange instead of original gradients. We summarize alternative approaches in FCL settings in the later section.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">According to the different distribution characteristics of data, existing FL methods can be categorized into horizontal federated learning (HFL), vertical federated learning (VFL), and federated transfer learning (FTL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. HFL refers to the case where clients share a similar feature space but differ in sample space, which occurs in cross-silo and cross-device scenarios. VFL refers to the case where clients share a similar sample space but differ in feature space, which typically occurs in the cross-silo scenario. FTL refers to the situation that neither overlaps of feature space nor sample space are large, requiring some transfer learning approaches to assist FL training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth mentioning that although FL has achieved remarkable success in addressing the data silo issues and privacy concerns, and it is recognized as a promising direction, data heterogeneity has become a major bottleneck of this paradigm. Data heterogeneity is an inherent challenge in FL, as the data distribution across different clients is typically Non-IID due to differences in data sources, data collection methods, and data quality. Local models trained with heterogeneous data are also heterogeneous, which leads to poor performance when aggregating these models to produce a global model. After distributing it to clients, its performance may not be as good as some local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. We coin the term “<span id="S2.SS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">spatialCF</span>” to describe this phenomenon, since its intrinsic similarity with the scenario of CL–only a portion of data is available. Specifically, catastrophic forgetting in CL is due to the temporal unavailability of data, while heterogeneity in FL is caused by the spatial unavailability of data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In reality, the entire dataset is not available all at once but rather arrives continually in the form of task streams. The sequential training on new tasks often results in overwriting parameters of the model, leading to a significant decline in performance on previous tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several techniques have been proposed to address the challenges of CL, including regularization, parameter separation, dynamic architecture, replay, and knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, aim to constrain the changing of important parameters to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Parameter separation techniques, such as PackNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and PathNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, only activate relevant parameters for a certain task and keep the network the same in scale.

Some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> consider parameter separation and dynamic architecture techniques to be in the same category, namely parameter isolation, as they both reduce interference between new and old tasks by isolating parameters. The only difference is whether the structure of the network is dynamic or fixed. Replay-based methods, such as Experience Replay (ER) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> and Generative Replay (GR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, store and replay previously seen data to mitigate forgetting. Knowledge distillation methods, such as Knowledge Transfer via Distillation (KTD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> and Learning without Forgetting (LwF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, transfer knowledge from previously learned models to new models periodically to mitigate forgetting.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We believe the primary challenge faced by FL is comparable to CL: integrating knowledge learned from multiple clients’ data. The purpose of CL is to integrate knowledge from different time into a single model, conducted sequentially. In contrast, FL aims to fuse knowledge from multiple clients into one global model, carried out in parallel. Both CL and FL share the goal of fusing diverse knowledge. To some extent, FL can be seen as a sort of traditional CL but across different machines. Evidently, CL methods would be helpful in resolving FL problems.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct twelve experiments on CIFAR-100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> in an FL system that has three clients and one server. Every client would be trained on three tasks sequentially.
Each task’s data is split into a training set and a test set in a ratio of 7:3. Every client maintains a large test set that consists of the test dataset from the seen tasks so far. Therefore, the evaluation of the current model and the aggregated global model will run on this large test set.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For each scenario of data distribution among clients, the designed data distribution is different, as shown below:
In scenario <span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(A)</span> and <span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(B)</span>, the initial step involves randomly selecting 30 classes from a pool of 100. In Scenario <span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(A)</span>, the data of each class is evenly distributed among three clients, ensuring an equal quantity of data for each client. Conversely, in Scenario <span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(B)</span>, the data of each class is randomly assigned to different clients using a Dirichlet distribution. While all clients have data for every class, the sample quantities for each class are distributed randomly. In scenario <span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(C)</span>, each client initially randomly samples 15 classes exclusive to itself. Subsequently, from the remaining classes, 15 overlapping classes are selected. The data for these overlapping classes is evenly distributed among all clients. As for scenario <span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(D)</span>, there are no overlapping classes among clients.

Solid lines represent knowledge retention of clients in time, and dashed lines represent knowledge retention of clients in space. When the data distribution among clients is identical, and the distribution among local tasks is also the same, spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting does not occur, and the model’s performance improves. However, severe performance degradation occurs after aggregation when clients have training data with different classes. Additionally, when the local task sequence follows a class-incremental pattern, the model forgets all knowledge from previous tasks, resulting in temporal knowledge retention to zero.</figcaption>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At the beginning of the experiment, each client has a task sequence of three different tasks. After completing the training for a task, they will upload it to the server and participate in aggregation. Subsequently, they employ the received global model for continual learning on the next task.</p>

Meanwhile, each column represents a scenario among clients, e.g., Scenario <span id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A</span>. From the last row of Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.2.2 Datasets ‣ 3.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 3 Spatial-Temporal Catastrophic Forgetting ‣ Federated Continual Learning via Knowledge Fusion: A Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we can tell that when the task sequence is class-incremental, traditional FL methods have no ability to alleviate <span id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TemporalCF</span>. On the contrary, if the distributions among tasks are entirely identical, the local model will consistently learn from similar data, continually enriching its knowledge. In this scenario, the model’s performance on the initial test set may significantly improve, as it can accumulate and leverage similar patterns and features during the training process.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As for <span id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SpatialCF</span>, we observed that Scenario <span id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A</span> exhibits the highest spatial knowledge retention, especially when the distribution among tasks is class-incremental. Conversely, Scenario <span id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">D</span> has the lowest spatial knowledge retention, particularly in the setting where tasks follow an IID distribution. When clients share the same classes and each client has an equal number of samples, local models become more similar, leading to enhanced performance after weighted averaging. The Class-Incremental setting reduces the complexity of each task, further minimizing the differences among local models. However, when each client has different classes, the heterogeneity among local models intensifies, causing crucial parameters to be overwritten during aggregation, resulting in a sharp decline in performance on local tasks.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the analysis, we can draw a very important conclusion: <span id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">The divergence in distributions among clients leads to spatial forgetting, whereas differences in distributions among tasks result in temporal forgetting. </span>The greater the variance in data among clients, such as differences in classes, the more crucial it becomes to design an effective knowledge fusion algorithm for amalgamating heterogeneous models, rather than a straightforward aggregation approach. A good FL algorithm must be able to effectively integrate knowledge extracted from various clients, especially retaining knowledge of seen classes to prevent performance degradation caused by catastrophic forgetting.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on whether the task sequence of the client is the same, FCL can be preliminarily divided into two types: synchronous FCL and asynchronous FCL.
Synchronous FCL refers that all clients share a common task sequence, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.1 Synchronous FCL ‣ 4 Federated Continual Learning ‣ Federated Continual Learning via Knowledge Fusion: A Survey" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
In other words, all clients would learn one task and learn the next task together.</p>

According to the limitations we mentioned above, we prefer to call this scenario CFL rather than FCL. The setting is idealized since it has strict limitations on the task sequences of different clients. We give the definition of synchronous FCL:</p>

And they proposed a framework called CFeD, which employs knowledge distillation based on surrogate datasets to mitigate catastrophic forgetting both on the server-side and client-side. The most interesting point is that a part of clients are used for learning the new task and others are used for reviewing the old tasks in order to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Asynchronous FCL refers that clients will train their local models using distinct sequences of tasks and then send information to the server. And these sequences consist of tasks from a global task set in different orders. Subsequently, the knowledge from clients needs to be fused into one global model, then it will obtain the ability to perform well on all the tasks that have been seen by clients. Notice that no matter how different the order or number of tasks the clients process, in the view of the server, each client just processes one unique task.

Please note that we refer to this figure as an “ideal” asynchronous FCL because most existing FCL methods are primarily based on “aggregation” rather than “fusion”. Therefore, they are more like a combination of asynchronous and synchronous approaches: handling different task sequences and then aggregating local models to obtain the global model rather than fusing knowledge into global models.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 3: </span>Illustration of Asynchronous FCL. In Asynchronous FCL, the process of fusing knowledge is gradual, which means that once a client has finished training on a task, the server timely fuses it into the global model without waiting for other clients. An ideal Asynchronous FCL can turn <span id="S4.F3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">aggregation</span> into <span id="S4.F3.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">fusion</span>, allowing much more tolerance of asynchronous clients.</figcaption>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Apparently, asynchronous FCL is much more complex than the former one. As all clients share the same task sequence, there is no need to consider too much when aggregating models. However, in asynchronous FCL, the task sequences processed by clients are different, which poses greater challenges to overcome spatial catastrophic forgetting. On the one hand, knowledge needs to be layered, and on the other hand, different layers of knowledge need to be fused separately. But from another perspective, asynchronous FCL tends to be more practical because it is impossible to make the task sequence of all clients identical in reality.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of asynchronous FCL is explicit: the global model needs to retain the knowledge of clients as much as possible when fusing local models. In some applications with higher real-time requirements, new local knowledge uploaded by clients also needs to be fused into global model continually. Besides, new local model which is initialized on global model in next round would be better if it retains some local parameters in order to prevent dropping performance on local tasks.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section mainly discusses a diverse form of knowledge fusion in FCL. As discussed before, simply uploading the local model gradients to the server not only poses privacy risks but also hinders knowledge fusion. Recent research presented at NeurIPS 2019 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> demonstrated that in just a few iterations, a malicious attacker can fully extract the training data from gradients.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised learning to group similar data points together based on certain similarities or patterns within the dataset. Some FCL methods cluster the tasks for each client or directly cluster clients according to their similarity of task flows to enhance the effectiveness of model aggregation. Clustering in FCL is typically for personalization, which aims to precisely assign greater importance to the specific information of individual clients in order to balance the generalized knowledge learned from the entire set of clients with their unique characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>. There are two levels of personalization in FCL: client-level and group-level. Client-level personalization involves clients receiving the same global model from the server and adapting it locally to better fit their own tasks, as mentioned before. However, empirical evidence suggests that in practical scenarios, a single global model may not be able to accommodate the specific requirements of all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite>. Group-level personalization emerges to address this issue, by clustering the clients according to their similarity distance of tasks, and jointly training multiple global models to better accommodate the clients with Non-IID datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.</p>

This approach enables the automatic selection of the weights for different client models, enabling them to minimize the expected distance between the server model and client models. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>]</cite> proposes <span id="S5.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedAtt</span> to tackle concept drift in distributed 5G networks and achieves excellent results. FedAtt takes the server as query and clients as keys, computes layer-wise attention scores, and minimizes the weighted distance between global and local models, which enables the FL system to adaptively evaluate and balance the contribution of each local model.

The proposed approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite> commences with the random selection of a balanced set of samples from each client, establishing a balanced pre-training dataset. The federated averaging technique is then applied to train the model, resulting in an initial global model on the server. Subsequently, the traditional FL framework is augmented with the iCaRL strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>.

On a single client, if there is no intervention, the previously learned knowledge will deteriorate quickly when the new tasks do not overlap with the old ones. This problem is not limited to the client side; it also affects the server side since the heterogeneity of the client-side data and aggregation can cause some knowledge to be forgotten. Moreover, the dynamic nature of tasks on the client side exacerbates this forgetting phenomenon.

Subsequently, the merged prototypes are distributed to the clients, completing the knowledge exchange between local and global. Moreover, for privacy preservation, prototypes can be perturbed while transmitting. And it requires only a small amount of communication and reduces memory storage costs, leading to a more efficient federated system. Here are detailed introductions of these works.

The first neglected issue is task overlap. True incremental tasks and pseudo-incremental tasks should be distinguished to avoid unnecessary overhead. There are three scenarios for client-side incremental tasks: full-covered, semi-covered and not covered. If the present classes of a specific client are fully covered by its previous classes, the client can be trained directly. The authors solve this problem by utilizing a double-ended task alignment table. Similar to the routing table, it exists on both the server and the client side. The table on the client side records all task classes covered up to the current task and is uploaded to the server along with the local model after local training. The table on the server side then participates in the knowledge fusion of local models. The second neglected issue is the aggregation of heterogeneous local models. Due to the intrinsic nature of continual learning, different clients have dimensionally identical feature extractors and structurally heterogeneous classifiers (the output layers). The authors put forward Pre-Alignment (PreA) and Post-Alignment (PostA) strategies to solve this problem. PreA method means the output layers of clients are pre-defined by the server before each round of federated training. PostA method means the server adjusts and aggregates the output layers according to the alignment table submitted by the client. Another approach to perform the aggregation of heterogeneous local models is to utilize partial masks for the specific knowledge of each client and a total fusion mask for common knowledge among clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite>.</p>

Specifically, LGA surmounts both forgetting by a category-balanced gradient-adaptive compensation loss and ensures intrinsic category relations consistency within different incremental tasks with a category gradient-induced semantic distillation loss. Besides, perturbed prototype images of new classes are transmitted from local clients to the proxy server, reconstructed by the proxy server and processed via self-supervised prototype augmentation to pick the best old global model for semantic distillation. Global forgetting is thus overcome by improving the distillation gain of the category gradient-induced semantic distillation loss at the local side by providing the best global model from a global perspective.</p>

In traditional federated learning, the set of classes learned by each client is static. Federated reconnaissance, instead, requires that each client individually learn a growing set of classes and effectively communicate knowledge of previously observed and incoming classes with other clients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib105" title="" class="ltx_ref">105</a>]</cite> proposes prototypical networks to address federated reconnaissance, which compresses concepts into relatively small vectors known as prototypes, enabling efficient communication. More important is that it enables fast knowledge transfer as it does not rely on gradient. Instead, first, a base model is trained on a set of base classes to provide the foundation for basic classification. The model is then deployed to clients, who are trained on instances of new or previously seen classes using local supervision. After each client has learned new classes, it is evaluated on the combined set of previous and new classes. The clients then share their knowledge of the new classes with a central server, which merges the knowledge and distributes it back to the clients. At this point, the server and clients have prototypes for each class, which can be used for classification. The most interesting point about this paper is that it can restore and load knowledge extracted from other tasks, as Knowledge Base used in CL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>, <a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>]</cite>.</p>

Then, regard the global model as the second teacher model to make use of the server’s ability to maintain a comprehensive knowledge base of all clients. The first teacher (the past model of a client) can improve the performance of a student on specific tasks, helping it maintain proficiency on previously learned tasks. On the other hand, the second teacher (the server) enhances the general features of a client model by transferring knowledge from all other clients and mitigating the risk of overfitting on new tasks.</p>

<p id="S5.SS8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, to overcome the problem of spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting in FCL, knowledge fusion is necessary. Knowledge can be represented in various forms: data, gradients, parameters, models and so on. How to fuse knowledge, especially fuse relevant knowledge, is the key to address challenges. Regularization realizes the common optimal solution by constraining the direction of parameter update, but if there is a huge difference between the two tasks, or even the opposite, then the performance will be even worse. The method of parameter isolation divides the parameters of a model into different parts based on specific rules, fusing relevant knowledge together without fusing irrelevant ones, which can further improve the generalization ability of the global model. Based on this idea, clustering divides clients into different groups through similarity, generating more than one global model, and avoiding the possibility of integrating irrelevant knowledge.</p>

<p id="S5.SS8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">By utilizing specific rules to divide the parameters of a model, the method of parameter isolation only fuses relevant knowledge, ultimately enhancing the generalization ability of the global model.

<p id="S5.SS8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The dynamic network structure method allows for dynamic adjustment of the network structure to accommodate more knowledge, but this puts higher demands on the design of the network structure. The knowledge distillation method conveys knowledge through the input and corresponding output of the models. The student model adjusts its output according to the guidance of the teacher model, making its output similar to the output of the teacher model, thus achieving knowledge transfer. Similarly, if encountering unrelated teacher models, its output may shift, resulting in the inability to complete tasks.</p>

Replay past knowledge to learn from it, but in FCL settings, a simple replay may cause privacy breaches. Moreover, whether replaying data from other clients is useful for oneself is also a question. And prototype networks achieve knowledge sampling by compressing a type of data into prototypes in a sample space. If we want to use this method in FCL, then we must ensure the consistency of the sample space.</p>

<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Trustworthy FCL</span>: One of the biggest challenges in promoting FL techniques is to strike a balance between privacy protection and model utility, which is also confronted by FCL. Generally, the enhancement of privacy comes at the cost of decreased model performance. To address this issue, Yang proposes Trustworthy Federated Learning to incorporate secure and reliable mechanisms into distributed federated modeling. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>]</cite> first reveals the incompatibility of privacy and utility in FL, set it as a multi-objective optimization problem, and applies the no-free lunch theorem in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>]</cite> to three privacy-preserving mechanisms, namely differential privacy, secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption. In addition to privacy and utility, an FL method should also consider the efficiency of algorithm, robustness of outliers, fairness of sampling, incentive mechanism and interpretability of the whole model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite> designs measurements of privacy leakage, utility loss and training cost for various privacy protection approaches, and finds Pareto optimal solutions to all considered objectives. The conflicts of objectives, especially the contradiction between utility and privacy, also exist in FCL. And the dilemma between stability and plasticity makes the problem more complicated and challenging. A possible solution is to seek the Pareto Front of multi-objective optimization and determine the equilibrium point based on the specific requirements of users, which is worth researching.</p>

Obviously, if uncertain samples are subjected to delayed decision-making, the average accuracy can be significantly improved, which is the underlying assumption of three-way decision (3WD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>, <a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>]</cite>. 3WD divides the decision space into three mutually disjoint regions, respectively signifying positive, negative and uncertain, the decision-making of uncertain samples is delayed until the learner has sufficient capacity of predicting at a high level of confidence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S6.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Convergence Time</span>: Due to the need for multiple rounds of knowledge communication and model iteration, FL often implies longer convergence time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib126" title="" class="ltx_ref">126</a>]</cite>. Some methods used for overcoming catastrophic forgetting in CL, such as rehearsal and generative replay, can result in slower convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>]</cite>. As the combination of FL and CL, FCL still has room for improvement in this area. Theoretically, reducing convergence time is crucial for efficient FCL training, since it can enable quicker deployment of updated models and more efficient utilization of computational resources. And numerous rounds of communication can inevitably increase the risk of privacy breaches or security vulnerabilities because it extends the duration of the exposure of information and thus weakens the privacy and security guarantees of FCL. Besides, the users of edge nodes also expect a shorter convergence time. However, most of the existing works on FCL only focus on accuracy. It is necessary for researchers to take convergence time into account and develop new techniques to improve the efficiency of FCL algorithms.</p>
