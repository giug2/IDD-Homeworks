<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Proof of work (PoW), as the representative consensus protocol for blockchain, consumes enormous amounts of computation and energy to determine bookkeeping rights among miners but does not achieve any practical purposes. To address the drawback of PoW, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus mechanism named platform-free proof of federated learning (PF-PoFL), which leverages the computing power originally wasted in solving hard but meaningless PoW puzzles to conduct practical federated learning (FL) tasks.
Nevertheless, potential security threats and efficiency concerns may occur due to the untrusted environment and miners' self-interested features. In this paper, by devising a novel block structure, new transaction types, and credit-based incentives, PF-PoFL allows efficient artificial intelligence (AI) task outsourcing, federated mining, model evaluation, and reward distribution in a fully decentralized manner, while resisting spoofing and Sybil attacks. Besides, PF-PoFL equips with a user-level differential privacy mechanism for miners to prevent implicit privacy leakage in training FL models. Furthermore, by considering dynamic miner characteristics (e.g., training samples, non-IID degree, and network delay) under diverse FL tasks, a federation formation game-based mechanism is presented to distributively form the optimized disjoint miner partition structure with Nash-stable convergence. Extensive simulations validate the efficiency and effectiveness of PF-PoFL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain, as a disruptive next paradigm innovation, offers a decentralized solution to immutably store information, transparently execute transactions, and automatically establish trust in open and trustless environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In blockchain systems, the consensus protocol is the core component which determines the system scalability, security, and consistency. The goal of consensus protocols is to ensure that all involved entities agree on an identical and consistent ledger without the need for a central authority.
The representative consensus protocol is the proof of work (PoW) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which is widely adopted in various blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
In PoW, miners compete for the bookkeeping rights and rewards by solving a cryptographic puzzle (which is hard to solve but easy to validate) through brute-forcing, i.e., <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">mining</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, the mining process is computation-hungry and consumes an enormous amount of computation and energy in solving meaningless PoW puzzles, controversial to the trend of sustainable and environment-friendly technology. As reported, the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin is comparable to that of Thailand, and the electricity that a single Bitcoin transaction consumes can power a U.S. household for about 3 weeks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the energy waste in PoW, research efforts have been made from two aspects: <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">energy saving</em> and <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">energy recycling</em>.
Proof of stake <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and proof of space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> are two typical energy-saving alternatives, which conserve energy by reducing mining difficulty for wealthy stakeholders who invest more in cryptocurrency or storage space. An explicit side effect of these methods is the non-democracy and corresponding Matthew's effects as rich participants have a higher chance for bookkeeping to earn more rewards. Meanwhile, there still exists ``useless'' resource waste on computation or storage in reaching consensus, remaining far from being really ``useful''.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another line of work studies the energy-recycling consensus approaches, where the wasted energy in solving hard but meaningless puzzles in PoW is recycled to perform practical useful works, known as proof of useful work (PoUW) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In PoUW, PoW mining tasks can be replaced with practical computational problems such as searching prime chains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, image segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and all-pairs shortest path <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which offers a suitable substitution of PoW for better sustainability of the blockchain system.
Recently, various works have attempted to design PoUW mechanisms using machine learning as the basis for useful tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Essentially, similar to PoW mining, training artificial intelligence (AI) models usually costs considerable computing power and time while its verification process is much easier.
Besides, the current trend of going deeper in AI models inevitably results in the ever-increasing demand for computing power. Thereby, it is natural to reinvest the computation power in PoW to train valuable AI models and employ trained models as proofs for completing the consensus.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, training a qualified AI model requires considerable training data as ``fuel", and a single miner or the task initiator may lack sufficient data samples on its device. Moreover, privacy concerns make it risky or even illegal in centralizing data samples from data owners (i.e., miners) for model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. As an attempt to fully unleash the power of AI using distributed data, Qu <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> recently introduced a general proof of federated learning (PoFL) consensus framework by reinvesting miners' computing power in solving meaningless PoW puzzles to train high-quality federated learning (FL) models. FL is a distributed AI paradigm which usually contains (i) a crowd of data owners (e.g., <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">miners</em>) who cooperatively train an AI model by sharing intermediate gradients and model parameters instead of their local datasets, and (ii) a central <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">curator</em> for learning coordination. Under FL, miners' training datasets are kept on local devices and only the locally computed model updates are shared, thereby greatly alleviating data privacy concerns. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, in PoFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, users first outsource their FL tasks to the online third-party platform (e.g., Kaggle and Codalab), then all the members within a mining pool collaboratively train the requested FL model before the deadline, and finally different pools compete to earn rewards by using the trained models as proofs.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> has made significant progress, there are still significant challenges that remain to be tackled.
First, the working of PoFL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> heavily depends on the trusted third-party platform which hosts FL tasks issued by requesters, determines the order of tasks for mining, and delivers rewards to the winning pool in the race. The malfunction or breakdown of the platform can cause a system failure, which is essentially a single point of failure (SPoF). Besides, the platform may collude with certain mining pools and disclose the FL tasks to them in an early stage, so that they can start training before others and gain benefits. Therefore, <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">it remains a concern to design a robust and fully decentralized PoFL scheme which gets rid of the central platform</em>.
Next, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> directly leverages off-the-shelf pooled-mining structures in PoW-based blockchains to train FL models. Different from the homogeneous PoW tasks, miners usually have distinct training samples and non-IID degrees and correspondingly distinct contributions when conducting different FL tasks under PoFL, causing a more complex pool formation problem. <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">There exists a challenge in dynamically forming optimized pooled structures with stable miner-pool association for diverse FL tasks</em>.
Furthermore, in the fully distributed and autonomous blockchain system, well-designed incentives for self-interested miners are benign impetuses to build a healthy consensus system with enhanced efficiency. Due to the intrinsic selfishness and behavior diversity of miners, <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">how to offer precise incentives to heterogenous miners for optimized consensus process is a challenging issue</em>.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, we propose a novel platform-free proof of federated learning (PF-PoFL) scheme to build a sustainable and robust blockchain ecosystem by removing the central platform and forming a dynamically optimized pooled structure for AI model training.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, PF-PoFL involves three types of blockchain nodes: (i) <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">requesters</em> that produce FL tasks, (ii) model <em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">trainers</em> (consisting of <em id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">curators</em> and <em id="S1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">miners</em>) that train FL models within a pool, and (iii) <em id="S1.p6.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">validators</em> (selected from miners) that are in charge of model rankings and proposing new blocks.
Specifically, requesters directly announce their FL tasks with rewards to the blockchain, and a group of validators collectively maintain an ordered queue of unfinished tasks.
For an unfinished task, a crowd of miners with distinct training data size, non-IID degree, and network delay dynamically form a stable pooled structure via the federation formation game.
Next, coordinated by the corresponding curator, different pools compete to train the FL model and the pool with the best model earns the task reward via the consensus process. The validators are evenly compensated with the transaction fees.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the literature, there has been an increasing interest in designing energy-recycling consensus mechanisms by substituting the hash puzzles in PoW with valuable works which are hard to solve but easy to verify.
Initially, early efforts focus on replacing the PoW nonce with practical computational problems.
Ball <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed a novel concept proof of useful work (PoUW) to replace the PoW mining with mathematic problems such as all-pairs shortest path and orthogonal vectors.
King <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a novel cryptocurrency named Primecoin to generate scientific value in the mining process, where miners are required to search long prime chains as proofs of work with difficulty adjustability and non-reusability.
Shoker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> devised a sustainable consensus protocol named proof of exercise, in which miners choose to solve matrix-oriented computation issues hosted on a third-party platform instead of calculating hashes in PoW.

After FL model training, malicious pools may submit multiple meaningless models (to waste system resources) or send the same model multiple times (to earn more benefits), using Sybil identities.

The malicious platform may also collude with part of miners to conduct market manipulation by revealing FL tasks to them in advance. In addition, the platform may be compromised by attacks such as DDoS, causing leakage of miners' sensitive information that is stored in it.</p>

Thereby, our work is also applicable to non-cryptocurrency applications and can encourage nodes' participation willingness and honesty.
Specifically, members of the validator committee are randomly chosen based on their weights via a cryptographic sortition approach implemented by a verifiable random function (VRF).</p>

In the model ranking smart contract, a model transaction will not be included in the candidate block by honest validators if it is published within the testing phase of the task. Hence, trainers do not have incentives to cheat by training a perfect model on the test data. Besides, as only the hashes of trained FL models are released in federated mining process, adversaries cannot plagiarize the FL models trained by other pools. Besides, the payment delivery to members of the winning pool is executed automatically via the block rewarding smart contract, the refusal-to-pay threat can be avoided.

Besides, instead of allowing multiple miners to simultaneously transfer to a single pool, the switch operation to a single pool is executed in a greedy manner in our work, where only the miner with the largest positive switch gain is permitted.
Thereby, the partition result derived through Algorithm <a href="#alg3" title="Algorithm 3 ‣ V-B Stable Pool Formation Algorithm ‣ V Dynamic Optimized Pool Structure Formation ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> is near-optimal, which is also evaluated using simulations in comparison with the exhaustive optimal solution in Sect. <a href="#S6.SS3" title="VI-C Federated Mining with UDP ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-C</span></span></a>.

In the blockchain, the shorter the consensus time, the better the consensus efficiency. Here, the consensus time is mainly determined by the delay in model downloading, model ranking, model verification, block propagation, and voting-based agreement process. In the simulation, the ratio of malicious or Byzantine miners is set to be 20%.
From Fig. <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI-B System Throughput and Latency ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, it can be seen that, when the block height grows from 100 to 200, both the TPS and the block latency of our proposed PF-PoFL consensus mechanism remain relatively stable. Specifically, the throughput mainly varies between [300, 500] TPS, while the block latency changes within [18, 25] seconds, which indicates a relatively stable block packaging frequency of our PF-PoFL consensus mechanism. It can be explained as follows.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI-B System Throughput and Latency ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> shows the throughput and the block latency of PF-PoFL in the distributed setting when the block size increases from 0.5 MB to 10 MB. It can be observed that our PF-PoFL system can efficiently handle hundreds of transactions per second and the block latency is below 47 seconds. As seen in Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI-B System Throughput and Latency ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, with the increase of block size, the block latency keeps increasing while the blockchain throughput first increases then decreases when the block size is over 8.5 MB. It can be explained as follows. On one hand, the higher block size indicates that more transactions are included within a block, resulting in a higher latency in transaction processing and block propagation. On the other hand, the relatively higher block size means that more transactions to be processed in a new block, which brings a higher TPS. However, the TPS cannot grow with the block size all the time. The reason is when the block size is too large (i.e., over 8.5 MB), the time to verify and broadcast the block can be extended, so that the distributed blockchain cannot be synchronized in time.</p>

The execution time of model ranking contract mainly consists of two parts: the contract running time (to produce local model ranking result) and the time to reach agreement on the final model ranking result (to be committed on blockchain). Note that in Algorithm 1, each validator can process multiple FL model transactions (including model downloading and evaluation) in parallel to reduce the contract running time. As seen in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VI-B System Throughput and Latency ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, the average contract running time of validators is 4.952 seconds and the time to reach agreement is 16.583 seconds, leading to a overall latency of about 21.1 seconds.</p>

As seen in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VI-B System Throughput and Latency ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, PoFL involves huge computation cost in model evaluation process (i.e., calculating model performance), especially for pools due to the expensive HE operations.
Compared with the PoFL scheme, our PF-PoFL adds the Gaussian noise according to Eqs. (<a href="#S4.E7" title="In IV-D Federated Mining with UDP ‣ IV PF-PoFL: Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Framework ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>) and (<a href="#S4.E8" title="In IV-D Federated Mining with UDP ‣ IV PF-PoFL: Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Framework ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>) to ensure UDP for miners, and the time cost for pools in this process can be negligible.
For model ranking and verification operations performed by validators, PoFL only needs to determine the best model. It indicates that if the model with the best performance is verified as true, there is no need to verify other models.
In our PF-PoFL, each validator needs to test and sort all relevant models to determine the financial rewards and credit incentives in the block rewarding contract, causing a longer running time (e.g., 172 microseconds for model ranking and 2.927 seconds for model verification in setting 2) than that in the PoFL (e.g., 51 microseconds for model ranking and 1.296 seconds for model verification in setting 2).
Besides, Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VI-B System Throughput and Latency ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ A Platform-Free Proof of Federated Learning Consensus Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchains" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> shows that the total consensus time for reaching agreement among validators on a new block is about 9.4 seconds in our PF-PoFL in setting 1 (resp. 21.3 seconds in setting 2), which is faster than that in the PoFL, i.e., 12.2 seconds in setting 1 (resp. 39.8 seconds in setting 2). The reasons are as follows. On one hand, the block proposal in PoFL involves huge storage space for encrypted model parameters in HE and 2PC, resulting in a higher block propagation latency. On the other hand, our credit-based Algorand BA protocol can employ more honest miners in the validator committee and incentivize miners to act legitimately and actively, thereby reducing the voting stages and the delay in reaching an unambiguous agreement.</p>

The reason is that in the non-cooperative scheme, all miners work alone and each of them forms a singleton in conducting FL tasks, resulting in the lowest social welfare. Besides, as different miners generally have distinct training samples and non-IID degrees under heterogenous FL tasks, the fixed mining pool structure in the PoFL scheme cannot adapt to the varying federated mining environment, resulting in relatively lower social welfare.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a novel energy-recycling consensus mechanism named PF-PoFL, where the wasted energy in solving cryptographic puzzles in PoW is reinvested to FL.
To implement PF-PoFL in a fully decentralized manner, we utilize the blockchain to host the unfinished tasks, perform model ranking, and enforce financial settlement by devising a novel block structure, a model ranking contract, and a block rewarding contract. PF-PoFL also incorporates credit-based incentives to motivate miners' honest participation and improve consensus efficiency. Furthermore, a user-level privacy-preserving model training algorithm is designed to offer rigorous privacy protection for miners in each pool. In addition, based on the federation formation game, we present an optimized pool formulation algorithm, where miners with diverse characteristics (i.e., training samples, non-IID degree, and network delay) in heterogenous FL tasks can self-organize into a disjoint Nash-stable partition.
Simulation results have validated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed PF-PoFL mechanism.
For the future work, we will further investigate the optimized PF-PoFL consensus mechanism with optimal FL task rewarding, task difficulty adjustment function, and non-reusability guarantees.</p>
