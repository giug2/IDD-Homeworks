<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Health management has become a primary problem as new kinds of diseases and complex symptoms are introduced to a rapidly growing modern society.
Building a better and smarter healthcare infrastructure is one of the ultimate goals of a smart city.
To the best of our knowledge, neural network models are already employed to assist healthcare professionals in achieving this goal.
Typically, training a neural network requires a rich amount of data but heterogeneous and vulnerable properties of clinical data introduce a challenge for the traditional centralized network.
Moreover, adding new inputs to a medical database requires re-training an existing model from scratch.
To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep learning-based clinical decision support system trained and managed under a federated learning paradigm.
We focused on a novel strategy to guarantee the safety of patient privacy and overcome the risk of cyberattacks while enabling large-scale clinical data mining.
As a result, we can leverage rich clinical data for training each local neural network without the need for exchanging the confidential data of patients.
Moreover, we implemented the proposed scheme as a sequence-to-sequence model architecture integrating the attention mechanism.
Thus, our objective is to provide a personalized clinical decision support system with evolvable characteristics that can deliver accurate solutions and assist healthcare professionals in medical diagnosing.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Remarkable advances in digital and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies bring great potential to transform a wide range of cities into smart cities.
With the rise of the smart cities concept, automation strategy, based on a tremendous deployment of IoT devices and software solutions, helps to improve cities’ services and makes more efficient use of their existing infrastructures and assets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Smart cities take the advantages of information and communications technology (ICT) to enhance a better quality of life for their citizens by delivering smarter infrastructures in education, transportation, healthcare, economy, and environmental management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Thus, the goal of every smart city is to keep a balance in terms of sustainability in economic, environmental, and social impact <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Despite the countless benefits of smart city innovations, many challenges need to be focused on, as rapid urbanization introduces new problems to an already complex environment of a highly-populated area.
Among them, health management has become one of the primary issues as new kinds of infectious diseases (i.e., Ebola, plague, COVID-19, etc.) are introducing to a rapidly growing modern society <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
To prevent such disease outbreaks leading to the global pandemic, the authorities keep investigating the medical science and provide better innovations to the health management sector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed numerous kinds of innovations to the smart city domain and gains great attention in many different and popular applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
AI also plays as a key component in developing better healthcare infrastructures ranging from patient monitoring to clinical data mining.
As many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data, various types of supervised machine learning models can provide AI-based solutions for medical diagnoses and deliver accurate results to healthcare professionals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
A sufficient amount of clinical data is an important prerequisite for accelerating and promoting healthcare services through AI technology.
For training a better medical diagnosis system, clinical data such as electronic health records (EHRs) from different sources of the medical organization need to be collectively organized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
However, these data may involve not only the privacy of individual patients but also the experimental details of medical organizations.
Due to the heterogeneous and vulnerable properties, dealing with limited clinical data becomes a huge obstacle for big data analysis to facilitate precision medicine while developing better healthcare infrastructures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based clinical decision support system that can provide healthcare professionals with accurate predictions of potential diseases according to patients’ symptoms in their medical records.
We integrate the aid of edge AI that allows the processing of AI algorithms locally on edge devices (i.e., healthcare professionals’ personal computers or mobile phones) for reducing the cost of data communication to perform the real-time operations and avoiding the transmission of vulnerable clinical data for a privacy perspective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
We exploit the federated learning paradigm that can work with a certain degree of non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data from heterogeneous sources by learning a shared global model at the central server while keeping all the sensitive clinical data on each local device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
As a result, local models can benefit from a global model with a predictive capacity of training on a rich source of clinical data while not compromising their data as well as preventing the cause of misdiagnosis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, most of the existing medical diagnosis models need to be re-trained from scratch whenever new input features (i.e., symptoms) and target labels (i.e., diseases) are added in order to expand the prediction for new diseases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
In our proposed system, we designed a sequence-to-sequence network for training local medical diagnosis models in which symptoms and diseases are treated as input and output sequences, respectively.
For the models to be able to focus more on the relevant input sequences and predict accurate output sequences, we adopt the attention mechanism in designing the network architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Thus, our system can easily adapt new input features and target labels and evolve to predict new kinds of diseases from heterogeneous sources without re-training the models from scratch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Let us consider a personalized healthcare architecture in which different medical diagnosis models jointly participate in learning the heterogeneous clinical data from the EHRs of regional healthcare professionals.
The global model in the centralized server does not take part in the training process but captures the shared knowledge of all local models and monitors their training rounds.
Each local model trains its own neural networks on its private training dataset of medical records. Each trained model is deployed onto the personal devices of individual healthcare professional to assist in classifying the diseases based on the related symptoms.
Classification outputs from those models are analyzed by the healthcare professionals based on their expert knowledge to evaluate the final result.
The evaluated results of symptom-disease pairs are stored in the local database for the model calibration.
The local model sends its model updates to the central server after each round of the training process.
The server aggregates the collected local model updates and creates a new single global model. Then, the aggregated global model is distributed for replacing the local models and updating their performance.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.4" class="ltx_p">We design the architecture of our proposed clinical decision support system as a deep recurrent neural network (Deep RNN).
While constructing the local medical diagnosis models, we process the sequence-to-sequence modeling for symptom-disease mapping, where symptoms are input sequences as well as diseases are treated as output sequences.
Each mapping is comprised of two RNN models for the encoder network and decoder network, respectively.
We establish direct shortcuts between the input symptoms and the target diseases by applying the attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder network.

In the traditional training pipeline of a neural network, the training process is centralized and it becomes infeasible to communicate as the data to be collected grows larger.
To alleviate the expensive communication costs together with security and privacy issues of the centralized training scheme, we collaborate the federated learning settings to our model architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

The aggregated global model is distributed back to the local models after each round of global model updates.
By training our RNN models under the federated learning settings, we can reduce the communication costs between the local models and the server.
As well as the local clients are no longer required to reveal their sensitive data to the central server or between each other.
The aforementioned procedure of the federated learning setting is listed in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II-B Collaboration of Federated Learning ‣ II System Architecture ‣ Attention on Personalized Clinical Decision Support System: Federated Learning Approach This work was partially supported by Institute of Information &amp; communications Technology Planning &amp; Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.2019-0-01287, Evolvable Deep Learning Model Generation Platform for Edge Computing) and by Institute of Information &amp; Communications Technology Planning &amp; Evaluation(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT)(2020-0-00364, Development of Neural Processing Unit and Application systems for enhancing AI based automobile communication technology). *Dr CS Hong is the corresponding author." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

As the individual local model is trained on its own local dataset and evaluates the results on the same dataset, all the local models converge after five rounds of the training process.
However, the results of the testing processes are evaluated on the dataset of various clinical data.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based personalized clinical decision support system trained and managed under a federated learning paradigm to assist healthcare professionals in medical diagnosing.
We integrated the aid of edge AI to train the local models distributively on the personal devices of healthcare professionals for reducing the data communication cost and avoiding the transmission of vulnerable data.
We exploited the federated learning framework to train our personalized models collaboratively by learning a shared global model at the central server while keeping all the privacy of clinical data on each local device.
As a result, our proposed clinical decision support system outperforms the benchmark centralized scheme by enabling large-scale clinical data mining while preserving the sensitive information of patients and medical organizations.
Moreover, we adopted the attention mechanism in designing our medical diagnosis models as sequence-to-sequence networks.
Thus, our system possesses the evolvable characteristics that can easily adapt new input symptoms and expand the prediction for new diseases.
For a more detailed scenario as optimizing the communication costs of the federated model to account for the noisiness of various biomedical data is considered as our future work.</p>
