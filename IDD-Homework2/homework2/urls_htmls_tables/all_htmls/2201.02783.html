<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In a modern power system, real-time data on power generation/consumption and its relevant features are stored in various distributed parties, including household meters, transformer stations and external organizations. To fully exploit the underlying patterns of these distributed data for accurate power prediction, federated learning is needed as a collaborative but privacy-preserving training scheme. However, current federated learning frameworks are polarized towards addressing either the horizontal or vertical separation of data, and tend to overlook the case where both are present. Furthermore, in mainstream horizontal federated learning frameworks, only artificial neural networks are employed to learn the data patterns, which are considered less accurate and interpretable compared to tree-based models on tabular datasets. To this end, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework based on XGBoost, for distributed power prediction from real-time external features. In addition to introducing boosted trees to improve accuracy and interpretability, we combine horizontal and vertical federated learning, to address the scenario where features are scattered in local heterogeneous parties and samples are scattered in various local districts. Moreover, we design a dynamic task allocation scheme such that each party gets a fair share of information, and the computing power of each party can be fully leveraged to boost training efficiency. A follow-up case study is presented to justify the necessity of adopting the proposed framework. The advantages of the proposed framework in fairness, efficiency and accuracy performance are also confirmed.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Power prediction has become an increasingly important topic in the modern power system. An accurate and efficient prediction of the generated/consumed power not only enables system operators of different levels to make optimal planning and operation decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, but also enlightens electricity and ancillary service retailers on customizing their prices and services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The prevalence of machine learning further empowers power prediction with universal and high-performance data-mining algorithms. In the past decades, various literatures have employed machine learning to address power prediction, from statistical regression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and time series analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, to the more recent family of neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, using data collected from multiple sources of power generation or consumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One problem inherent in power prediction is the distributed nature of these data sources. For example, district-level power consumption data are generated inside numerous smart meters, and subsequently aggregated by hundreds of transformer stations across the city. Features relevant to power prediction (e.g., population mobility data) are also held by external parties in a distributed fashion. A centralized machine learning framework would require all these distributed parties to transfer their data to a central server for training, which would jeopardize data security and lead to high communicational burden during the data transfer.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, federated learning, proposed by Google in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, provides a viable solution framework that learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed model updates. In this framework, the proprietary datasets of each party remain immobilized, which protects both data privacy and training efficiency. Federated learning was then extensively investigated to address heterogeneity, security among other issues under various scenarios, during which two major branches emerged: (a) horizontal federated learning, which involved collaboration of multiple homogeneous parties with the same feature set but a different sample set; (b) vertical federated learning, where the collaborating parties were heterogeneous, holding the same sample set but with complementary features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the past three years, federated learning has started to garner interest in various aspects of the power system. Saputra <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> designed a federated energy demand prediction framework for electric vehicle networks. Wen <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed FedDetect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to identify energy theft behavior in the smart grid. Wang <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> introduced federated learning into electricity consumer characteristics identification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In terms of power prediction, Fekri <em id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a distributed load forecasting scheme based on federated learning using recurrent neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and Gholizadeh <em id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> combined federated learning with hyperparameter-based clustering for electrical load forecasting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> systematically explored both horizontal and vertical federated learning on a power consumption dataset of 64 transformer stations across a southern China city, while introducing population mobility as external features to improve prediction accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, since its foundation, federated learning has been polarized towards either the horizontal or vertical framework, while neglecting the case where both are present. As is often the case, though, that features can be scattered in local heterogeneous parties while samples are scattered in different local districts, resulting in a hybrid case where data are separated both vertically and horizontally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">It is also noticeable that artificial neural networks are the mainstream machine learning algorithm built in federated learning frameworks, particularly horizontal federated learning, including the most renowned FedSGD and FedAvg frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. This is mostly attributable to the fact that neural network model updates can be properly “averaged” by the central server in these traditional frameworks, resulting in an aggregated model as if all data were centralized for training. On the other hand, averaging the updates of locally-trained models makes little sense for tree-based models, especially for the most advanced Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and LightGBM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> algorithms. There is empirical evidence, though, that tree-based models generally outperform neural networks in terms of prediction accuracy, especially on tabular datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Also, neural networks are known to be lacking in interpretability unlike decision trees. In a scenario where we wish to predict power with real-time external features such as demographics while maintaining an interpretable model, tree-based algorithms would be highly preferred.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, a handful of research papers on horizontal federated learning proposed alternative aggregation schemes for tree-based architectures. Instead of averaging the locally-trained model updates in each round, these schemes aggregate gradient statistics of the samples in each party, after which a central server starts a round of training (i.e., node splitting) on behalf of all parties. Liu <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed FEDXGB for mobile crowdsensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, in which the central server was forced to perform aggregation before decryption in the presence of a secret sharing algorithm. Li <em id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a serverless framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> where each party boosted a number of trees in turn, by exploiting similarity information based on locality-sensitive hashing. Tian <em id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed a horizontal and serverless FederBoost framework for private federated learning of gradient boosting decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, in which all the uploaded gradients were transferred to the active party for node splitting, and only a lightweight secure aggregation scheme was required. The essence of gradient aggregation in these frameworks, if properly combined with an XGBoost-based vertical framework such as SecureBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, can result in a hybrid federated learning framework entirely based on XGBoost, to address the case where data are both horizontally and vertically separated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, to maximally protect the privacy of each participant, a federated learning scheme independent of central servers, which are often assumed semi-honest, is pursued. Nonetheless, in a serverless tree-based federated learning framework, an “active party” is often responsible for the training of an entire tree, during which other parties have to transfer all gradients to that party and wait passively for the node splitting results. This poses additional fairness and efficiency threats to the framework, both of which are frequently discussed topics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> in federated learning:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study is based on a Smart City project carried out in a southern city of China, similar to the problem setup of our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In the project, the power consumption data are stored in 64 district-level transformer stations across the city, which are directly coordinated by the Power Supply Bureau. Weather information, scraped from the TimeAndDate website <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, are also treated as real-time internal features of the local transformer stations. In addition, China Mobile, China’s largest telecommunication company, signed an agreement in 2019 to supplement the project with district-level demographic information as external features. These features include real-time district portraits (headcount, age, gender, etc.) and the district’s Pearson correlation factor with typical zones (industrial, commercial, etc.).

XGBoost is therefore more interpretable than neural networks, the latter of which contains countless nonlinear feature combinations in neurons, making it hard to explain. XGBoost is also known to be a more powerful model with higher prediction accuracy on tabular datasets. This is one of the reasons that we adopt XGBoost as our bottom-level learning algorithm in the first place.</p>

Since the transformer stations hold the power consumption labels, one of the transformer stations is expected to become the active party and perform the node splitting task for each training epoch. All other transformer stations and mobile branches are obliged to send the bin statistics and aggregated gradients in steps 2) and 3). By leveraging both vertical SecureBoost and horizontal FederBoost, a collaborative XGBoost model is now trained with participation from all districts and both heterogeneous parties (namely the transformer stations and China Mobile). The resulting model is therefore expected to have a higher prediction accuracy and generalization ability with the additional samples and features supplemented into the dataset.</p>

This raises fairness and efficiency issues, as (a) The active party receives the whole intermediate information, while the other homogeneous parties, despite an equal contribution of training data, do not. This gives the active party an unfair advantage at inferring data of other parties; (b) The gradient aggregation and node-splitting tasks are all processed by the active party’s computing resources only, while other parties passively wait for the results, which is time-consuming.

Another important property of the framework, losslessness against a centralized and unencrypted XGBoost, is axiomatic, as long as the precision before encrypting floating-point gradients is set high enough (e.g., round gradients to a scale of <math id="S4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10^{-6}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p1.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mo id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3a" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">6</mn></mrow></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">10</cn><apply id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><minus id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">6</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1c">10^{-6}</annotation></semantics></math>).

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The security of the framework is guaranteed based on the following observations. First, all individual raw data are stored locally, with only timestamp IDs being publicly transferred. Second, all intermediate variables for training (e.g., individual gradients and gradient statistics) are Paillier-encrypted before being transferred. We can easily balance the trade-off between encryption quality and efficiency by tuning the magnitude of the prime number in Paillier. Third, each party has access to the node-splitting criteria if and only if it holds the feature that splits that node. Even after training, each party only holds half of the XGBoost model, and a collaborative learning is required in order to predict labels with the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this section, we perform a comprehensive case study on the problem setup. We implement the proposed XGBoost-based hybrid federated learning framework to predict distributed real-time power consumption of 10 spatially-adjacent districts, which span over a longitude of 0.1<sup id="S5.p1.2.1" class="ltx_sup">∘</sup> and latitude of 0.06<sup id="S5.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sup">∘</sup>. The training set spans over a time range of 2019.1.1 – 2020.1.20, and the test set spans over a time range of 2020.1.23 – 2020.3.21. All labels, namely the real-time power consumption, are normalized before training. Also, the dynamic task allocation scheme is implemented to improve fairness and efficiency. The case study is implemented in C++ (MinGW32-GCC 4.8.2) for constructing a modified version of XGBoost, and Python 3.8 for fairness and efficiency evaluation.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the superiority of XGBoost as a bottom-level machine learning algorithm, in <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V Case Study ‣ A Fair and Efficient Hybrid Federated Learning Framework based on XGBoost for Distributed Power Prediction" class="ltx_ref ltx_font_bold">Table 2</a> we compare the prediction accuracy of different learning algorithms after parameter tuning, in terms of the MSE. It can be seen that although the last three algorithms achieve a low prediction error on the training set, artificial neural network is prone to overfitting and sometimes even fails to converge. On the other hand, tree-based networks such as random forest and XGBoost generalize better to the test set, and XGBoost is proven to be the most outstanding. It should be noted that time-serie power forecasting based on historic consumption records reaches a test set MSE of 0.1788, indicating our prediction method based on real-time external features is sufficiently accurate.</p>

<p id="S5.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we observe that models trained by hybrid federated learning in fact have a higher generalization ability on all districts under study. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V Case Study ‣ A Fair and Efficient Hybrid Federated Learning Framework based on XGBoost for Distributed Power Prediction" class="ltx_ref ltx_font_bold">Figure 7</a> plots an adjusted heatmap of the MSE error vertically trained and tested respectively on each of the 10 single districts, as well as a heatmap of the prediction MSE of the hybrid learning model on each district. Blocks with a green colormap indicate scenarios where the as-trained model predicts worse on the test district than a model trained exactly on the training data of the same district (i.e., the diagonal blocks of the same column), and blocks with a blue colormap indicate otherwise. It can be seen that the vertically-trained single-district models mostly generalize poorly to other districts. The only exceptions are Districts 8-10 where the models of other districts may seem to generalize surprisingly well. However, this specious intuition can be debunked by the fact that these districts have much higher diagonal MSEs (a maximum of 0.57) compared to others, indicating that their training datasets are unrepresentative even of their districts, leading to inappropriate MSE baselines for comparison. Regardless, hybrid federated learning manages to predict accurately on each of the 10 districts with an enriched training dataset, with a maximum MSE of only 0.19.</p>

In District 1, vertical and hybrid federated learning frameworks predict equally well on the test set, with the predicted power curves almost overlapping with the actual one. Horizontal federated learning fails to reach a comparable performance due to the absence of features from China Mobile. Interestingly in District 10, the actual power curve experiences a steady downturn after January 25, attributable to the week-long Lunar New Year’s festival in China and the outbreak of Covid-19. All three federated learning frameworks fail to predict accurately in this particular scenario, but hybrid federated learning, possibly due to incorporation of the most datasets from other districts, generates a predicted curve closest to the actual curve.</p>

With the dynamic task allocation scheme, the training now requires only 9,017 seconds to complete, and may otherwise require an additional 7,220 seconds if we adopted a fixed active party allocation scheme instead. A closer investigation suggests that with the dynamic task allocation scheme, the node-splitting tasks are now more inclined towards districts with higher computational power; in fact, Districts 9 and 10 shoulder no node-splitting tasks due to their computational slowness. This further boosts computational efficiency, as the total gradient aggregation time is now identical to the least time required, namely the time for the slowest party to finish its own aggregation.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework that combines both horizontal and vertical federated learning based on XGBoost, for distributed power prediction of a city in southern China. With the hybrid framework, homogeneous and heterogeneous parties can collaboratively train an XGBoost model without leaking private information. In addition, a dynamic task allocation scheme is proposed to improve training performance. The follow-up case study justifies the practicability of the proposed framework, and its in providing a secure, fair and computationally efficient solution for the power prediction problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The hybrid federated learning framework with the dynamic task allocation scheme have deep implications in the power system. It addresses the distributed nature of smart grid data in both the horizontal and vertical dimension, and guides all parties to contribute to the pattern mining of power generation/consumption data in a coordinated manner. This allows for timely and effective decision-making after the power prediction process. Other potential improvements to this framework include the consideration of communication delays to address system heterogeneity, as well as the adoption of multi-task learning to address statistical heterogeneity.</p>
