<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) is a widely accepted means for supporting customized services for mobile devices and applications. Federated Learning (FL), which is a promising approach to implement machine learning while addressing data privacy concerns, typically involves a large number of wireless mobile devices to collect model training data. Under such circumstances, FL is expected to meet stringent training latency requirements in the face of limited resources such as demand for wireless bandwidth, power consumption, and computation constraints of participating devices. Due to practical considerations, FL selects a portion of devices to participate in the model training process at each iteration. Therefore, the tasks of efficient resource management and device selection will have a significant impact on the practical uses of FL. In this paper, we propose a spectrum allocation optimization mechanism for enhancing FL over a wireless mobile network. Specifically, the proposed spectrum allocation optimization mechanism minimizes the time delay of FL while considering the energy consumption of individual participating devices; thus ensuring that all the participating devices have sufficient resources to train their local models. In this connection, to ensure fast convergence of FL, a robust device selection is also proposed to help FL reach convergence swiftly, especially when the local datasets of the devices are not independent and identically distributed (non-iid). Experimental results show that (1) the proposed spectrum allocation optimization method optimizes time delay while satisfying the individual energy constraints; (2) the proposed device selection method enables FL to achieve the fastest convergence on non-iid datasets.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) has been widely used to help automate decision-making and improve business efficiency. However, traditional ML relies on centralized training approaches, hence leading to data privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. As mobile application services have achieved remarkable successes, there has been an emerging trend of employing Federated Learning (FL) over wireless mobile network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. As a large-scale data-intensive distributed system, FL involves a large number of wireless mobile devices to train a shared model given a training time budget and a resource budget.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Being a decentralized form of ML, FL performs ML without aggregating user data to a centralized server, thus making it easier to comply with the relevant data privacy regulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. At each global iteration in FL, the wireless devices first download initialized parameters of a global model from a remote server. Then, the devices train local models using their local available data in parallel. After several local iterations, the devices send their parameters to the server, and the global model is updated using the uploaded local parameters. The learning process is repeated until the global model achieves a preset accuracy.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the benefits, there are key challenges that limit the applications of FL over wireless mobile networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. To date, FL has been applied in a wide variety of fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. For example, mobile service providers such as Apple and Google investigate FL for enabling enhanced user experiences through learning from users’ behavior <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, in such important application scenarios, FL needs to deal with practical challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Specifically, FL usually involves a large number of mobile devices to ensure sufficient training data. In this case, it is challenging to deploy FL due to the limited bandwidth resources. In addition, the energy constraints of the individual devices also increase the difficulty of implementing FL. Although most existing spectrum allocation optimization methods mainly focus on total energy consumption, the energy cost of individual devices should be considered. Therefore, an effective spectrum allocation optimization method is critical to the adoption of FL in important applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In many scenarios, however, bandwidth resources are still insufficient even though the sophisticated spectrum allocation optimization methods are adopted, hence necessitating device selection methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. As device selection allows FL to choose a subset of wireless devices at each global iteration, the problem incurred by bandwidth limitation is significantly alleviated. Unlike traditional distributed ML which assumes that the datasets are independent and identically distributed (iid) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, FL needs to consider the statistical properties of the local datasets and deals with non-iid datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. To handle non-iid datasets in FL, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> mentioned a benchmark which performs device clustering based on the model weights of the local devices and randomly selects the same number of devices from each cluster. However, this method cannot guarantee that the selected devices are the optimal ones to help FL achieve convergence swiftly. Besides, this method suffers from high training latency as the model weights for training the clustering algorithm are usually high-dimensional.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we enhance the performance of FL by proposing an energy-efficient spectrum allocation optimization method and a weight divergence based device selection method. Specifically, the energy-efficient spectrum allocation optimization method aims to optimize the time delay of FL given the energy constraint of each local device. For the device selection problem, we train the K-means to perform device clustering while ensuring low training latency and high clustering performance. Then, we carry out device selection based on the weight divergence between the local model and the global model. The main contributions of our works include:</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper focuses on spectrum allocation optimization and device selection for FL. While existing works are dealing with spectrum allocation optimization and device selection for FL, our proposed method improves from existing schemes by addressing a number of practical considerations. Specifically, the proposed spectrum resource optimization scheme optimizes the bandwidth and CPU frequency of each local device, and the individual energy constraints are considered in the optimization problem; the proposed device selection method aims to speed up the convergence on non-iid datasets.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For spectrum allocation optimization to enhance FL, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a low-latency multi-access scheme for edge learning to minimize the communication latency of FL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> focused on minimizing the FL completion time by determining the tradeoff between computation delay and transmission delay. These works mainly considered minimizing the delay without considering energy consumption, while our proposed method considers not only time delay but also individual energy costs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a hierarchical framework for federated edge learning to jointly optimize computation and communication resources. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> illustrated two tradeoffs in FL and proposed FEDL to jointly optimize the FL completion time and energy consumption. These works considered both delay and energy by introducing an importance weight, though did not investigate the means for obtaining the optimal weight given the resources and time constraints. Our proposed method balances the tradeoff between delay and energy adaptively given the individual energy constraint. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> proposed a novel optimization algorithm to minimize the training time for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> studied the convergence bound for FL and propose a control algorithm to optimize the frequency of global aggregation under a resource budget constraint. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed an iterative algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption of FL and designed a bisection-based algorithm to optimize the time delay. Compared with our proposed method, these works did not consider the limited battery power of the individual local device.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For device selection, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed FedAvg that randomly selects a portion of local devices. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed a multicriteria-based approach for client selection to reduce total number of global iterations and optimize the network traffic. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposed a new FL protocol to select devices based on resource conditions to accelerate performance improvement. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> designed a greedy algorithm for device selection to balance the trade-off between the total number of global iterations and the latency. Compared with our proposed method, these works did not consider the data distribution of local datasets or assumed the local datasets to be iid. Recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed Favor that adopts double deep Q-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to perform active device selection on non-iid local datasets. However, a new policy network has to be trained from scratch when the datasets are changed, while our approach aims to remain effective when directly applied to other FL tasks with different datasets.</p>

First of all, the device clustering method divides local devices into several clusters based on the data distribution of the model weights. Next, at each global iteration: the device selection method chooses devices from each cluster; the selected devices download the global model from the server, and the spectrum allocation optimization method allocates the bandwidth and CPU frequency for each device; the subset of devices carries out the local update and upload their model weights to the server. The device clustering and selection methods aim to select the optimal devices that enable FL to swiftly achieve the target accuracy.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, the local devices are usually trained on highly skewed non-iid datasets. In a non-iid local dataset, most of the data samples come from a majority class (also called a dominant class <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>), while the remaining data samples belong to other classes. It is difficult for the local models to correctly identify the samples unless the samples belong to the majority class. Without a feasible device selection method, the global model is very likely to inherit such detrimental property through model aggregation. Take an image classification task on CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> as an example. If the device selection method rarely selects the devices whose majority class is "dog", the global model will achieve low accuracy in recognizing the samples that belong to the "dog" class.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, K-means based device clustering is bottlenecked by long training latency especially when heavyweight CNN models are used as the local model. This is because the feature vectors for training the K-means model are the model weights which usually contain millions of parameters. In addition, randomly choosing devices from each cluster does not guarantee that the selected devices are the optimal ones to help FL reach fast convergence. There is still room to further enhance K-means based device clustering and selection.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We improve K-means based device clustering by reducing the computational running time without sacrificing the clustering performance. To this end, the size of the feature vector for training the K-means model should be shrunk. Specifically, the K-means model is trained using the model weights of only one layer in CNN instead of all the weights. Since K-means clustering adopts the Euclidean distance to measure the similarities between two samples, we calculate the Euclidean distance between two local models using the model weights of each layer. The clustering performance can be estimated by visualizing the Euclidean distance matrix.</p>

It can be observed that the global model achieves the highest accuracy on the "dog" cluster when local device 22 is selected. This is because the weight divergence can reflect the performance gap between the local model and the global model on the corresponding local dataset. Thus, the dataset of local device 22 is most informative for the global model. Selecting this device allows the global model to be improved significantly on this cluster. Note that the above experiments are conducted and evaluated on the training set.

The solid curves represent the mean, and the shaded regions correspond to the minimum and maximum returns over the ten trials. In most cases, the accuracy curves of the proposed method and the K-means method are above the curve of FedAvg. This is because the proposed method and the K-means method divide the local devices into several clusters based on the majority class. By choosing the local devices from each cluster, the bias incurred by non-iid datasets is significantly alleviated. Besides, we observe that the accuracy curve of the proposed method increases fastest among these device selection methods. This experimental result shows that the local devices chosen by the proposed method enable the FL model to reach convergence swiftly. Furthermore, the shaded regions of our method are the smallest, which demonstrates the stability of our method.

This is because given the target accuracy 55%, the accuracy of FL is only about 53% when FL reaches convergence. Thus, we cannot obtain the total number of global iterations of ICAS. First, the confidence intervals of the proposed method and the K-means method are smaller than that of FedAvg. It further demonstrates that device clustering speeds up the FL training process. Secondly, the medians values of the proposed method are smaller than the two baselines. Thirdly, ICAS does not obtain good performance because the mechanism of ICAS is on the basis of the assumption: the loss function is Lipschitz continuous and strongly convex. Nevertheless, our paper adopts a non-convex function, hence degrading the performance of ICAS. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the weight divergence based device selection method.</p>

Favor applies the reinforcement learning algorithm to select the optimal devices for training FL. However, the CNN architectures of the local models, the local datasets, and other parameter settings in Favor are different from ours. Therefore, we cannot directly cite the total number of global iterations of Favor into our work for comparison. As FedAvg was also implemented in Favor as a baseline, the performance of Favor and the proposed method can be compared by evaluating how much these methods improve the FL training over FedAvg. To this end, we introduce an improvement score as follows.</p>

Besides, the well-trained reinforcement learning models in Favor are no longer effective when dealing with new datasets. In contrast, the proposed method is flexible and can be directly employed even though the datasets are changed. In conclusion, the experimental results demonstrate that the weight divergence based device selection method outperforms Favor.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied the spectrum allocation optimization and device selection problems for enhancing FL over a wireless mobile network. We formulated the computation and communication models to calculate the energy consumption and time delay of FL. We formulated the optimization problem to minimize the time delay of training the entire FL algorithm given the individual energy constraint and the total bandwidth. We proposed an energy-efficient spectrum allocation optimization method and a weight divergence based device selection method to solve this problem. The proposed spectrum allocation optimization method aims to minimize the time delay under one global iteration while warranting the energy constraints. For device selection, we conducted device clustering by training the K-means algorithm with part of model weights in CNNs. We have proposed the weight divergence based device selection method to select the devices from each cluster. According to our experimental results, the proposed spectrum allocation optimization method optimizes the time delay of FL while satisfying the energy constraints; the proposed device clustering method realizes a fast training process and high clustering performance; the proposed device selection method helps FL to achieve convergence swiftly and outperforms other baselines.</p>
