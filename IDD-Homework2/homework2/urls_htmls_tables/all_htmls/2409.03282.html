<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Non-recurrent conditions caused by incidents are different from recurrent conditions that follow periodic patterns. Existing traffic speed prediction studies are incident-agnostic and use one single model to learn all possible patterns from these drastically diverse conditions. This study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to improve traffic speed prediction under two separate conditions, recurrent and non-recurrent (i.e., with and without incidents). The MoE leverages separate recurrent and non-recurrent expert models (Temporal Fusion Transformers) to capture the distinct patterns of each traffic condition. Additionally, we propose a training pipeline for non-recurrent models to remedy the limited data issues. To train our model, multi-source datasets, including traffic speed, incident reports, and weather data, are integrated and processed to be informative features. Evaluations on a real road network demonstrate that the MoE achieves lower errors compared to other benchmark algorithms. The model predictions are interpreted in terms of temporal dependences and variable importances in each condition separately to shed light on the differences between recurrent and non-recurrent conditions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Transportation networks, designed to serve people with efficient mobility, are plagued by congestion. In 2019, U.S. roadways witnessed 8.8 billion hours of travel delay and 55 hours of delay per driving commuter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, around half of which is with incidents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> (25% by accidents, 15% by weather and 10% by work zones). Those planned and unplanned incidents (e.g. hazardous weather conditions, accidents, local events, etc.) on the highway networks can catastrophically impact mobility and safety. Mitigating incident impacts requires accurate and ahead-of-curve real-time prediction and proactive operational management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. This study seeks to address the primary challenge of accurately predicting network traffic states.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traffic conditions with the occurrence of incidents are regarded as non-recurrent, which are distinct from the recurrent conditions that follow periodic patterns. Non-recurrent conditions caused by incidents are volatile because incidents typically lead to sudden disruptions in the flow of traffic. These incidents create irregular traffic patterns and can significantly impact travel times and congestion levels. In contrast, recurrent conditions are the result of consistent and predictable factors, such as daily rush hours or regular bottlenecks, where traffic patterns follow a routine cycle.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite consideration of road incidents (accidents, severe weather impact, etc) in modeling, existing approaches of traffic prediction fail to distinguish between recurrent conditions and non-recurrent conditions. A general consensus is that existing real-time traffic prediction works reasonably well for recurrent traffic, but not yet well for non-recurrent traffic (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> in which a state-of-the-art time series forecasting model is applied). It is less studied to accurately predict traffic states in non-recurrent conditions by learning from multi-source emerging traffic data. What makes it particularly challenging is to work with an incident that occurs at a location/time where incident data is very rare or even nonexistent. It is also unclear how predictions in non-recurrent conditions differ from recurrent ones.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A Mixture of Experts (MoE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> is a universal model structure that combines multiple specialized sub-models, or "experts," each tailored to handle different aspects or patterns within a dataset. A gating network determines which expert(s) to utilize for a given input, optimizing performance by leveraging the strengths of each expert for specific types of data or tasks. Inspired by the diverse capabilities of MoE shown in recent large language models (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>) and the observation that data of recurrent and non-recurrent conditions is heterogeneous, we propose a MoE-based model that contains a recurrent expert model and a non-recurrent expert model. For the expert model backbone, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> is selected because of its superior forecasting capability and interoperability. Moreover, a general training pipeline is proposed for the non-recurrent expert model to remedy the limited data issues.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Leveraging machine learning to predict traffic flow or traffic time has been widely studied in the last decades. First, linear time series analysis has been widely recognized and used for traffic flow/speed prediction, such as Auto-Regressive Intergrated Moving Average (ARIMA) utilized by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, for instance. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> adopts Kalman filtering for traffic flow forecasting. Non-parametric regression model was also utilized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Classical machine learning models, such as Support Vector machine model, is also used to predict traffic flow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> as well as travel time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Compressed sensing is exploited by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to reduce the complexity of network, then support vector regression (SVR) is used for predicting travel speed on a Nationwide traffic network in Singapore. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> applied hidden Markov Model by incorporating traffic volume, lane occupancy, and traffic speed data in the model, using data from a 38 mile corridor of I-4 in Orlando, FL. In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> also used Markov chains to predict travel time on arterial routes. In those studies, oftentimes features used to train machines are limited to the road segment of its own. Very few spatio-temporal features were incorporated, which can drastically improve prediction performance, particularly under incidents.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, studies have taken spatial-temporal correlations into consideration when predicting link travel time or flows. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> considered spatial correlations as function of distance and degree of neighbors when applying a multivariate autoregressive moving-average model to the forecasting of traffic speed, which was tested on a dataset collected via 25 loop-detectors at Athens, Greece. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> discusses the extensions of time series prediction model such as ARIMA by considering correlations among neighbors and the utilization of LASSO for model selection.

First, the raw data is processed to be features. Then, the features are aligned both spatially and temporally.</p>

The raw speed data is organized from INRIX probe vehicle data in TMC (Traffic Message Channel) resolution with a temporal resolution of 5 minutes. The slowdown speed (SD) is then extracted from the organized TMC speed data by Equations (<a href="#S4.E1" title="In 4.1.1 Data processing ‣ 4.1 Data pipeline for multi-source data ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). The reason of including SD is to provide the model with indicators of traffic congestion and incidents and denoise the incident features, which will be elaborated on later.</p>

The incident status of targeted road segments is initially collected from Waze. Several types of incidents, including accidents, road-closing events, and hazard floods, are deemed critical and chosen for our study. Because Waze does not record all critical events or anomalies and some Waze reports have trivial impacts on traffic states, we propose an algorithm to denoise the Waze incident data, which is summarized in algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 4.1.1 Data processing ‣ 4.1 Data pipeline for multi-source data ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

Then, for each incident reported by Waze, if there is no abnormal slowdown during the reported incident interval, the incident is regarded as insignificant and removed.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Given the denoised incident indicators, three incident features are produced, including segment incident indicator, network incident indicator, and incident count.

The incident count is the number of incidents happening in the network at this time.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Mixture of Experts (MoE) model is a machine learning approach that combines the strengths of multiple specialized models to solve complex prediction tasks. Each "expert" within the mixture is typically a separate neural network or other machine learning models. A gate or router dynamically assigns input data to the most appropriate experts. This gate determines the weighting of each expert’s output based on the input features. The MoE approach is advantageous for predicting recurrent and non-recurrent traffic states due to its ability to handle diverse and complex patterns in traffic data. By employing multiple specialized models (experts) and a gate to dynamically allocate input data, MoE allows each expert to focus on specific aspects of traffic patterns, leading to more accurate and robust predictions. Besides, this method enhances model interpretability, as it highlights the factors influencing different traffic states, and offers flexibility and scalability, allowing for the addition of new experts without retraining the entire model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.12" class="ltx_p">We adopt the MoE model structure to suit the diverse needs of predictions in recurrent and non-recurrent conditions. Specifically, our model is composed of independent recurrent and non-recurrent components, thereby enabling efficient adaptation to diverse traffic conditions.</p>

First, TFT demonstrated superior time series forecasting performances in various types of datasets including traffic and electricity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

The input features and past target values first go through variable selection blocks, in which gated residual networks are utilized to assign variable selection weights to all input variables. Then, the weighted input features in the context time window and the weighted past target values are sent to a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based encoder, while the weighted input features in the prediction window are sent to an LSTM-based decoder. Subsequently, a temporal fusion decoder calculates the multi-head attention among embeddings of different time steps similar to the attention mechanism in the transformer model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. These blocks enable TFT to learn the temporal dependencies and the variable importance, which bring not only strong forecasting performances but also superior interpretability.

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The data distribution of the non-recurrent conditions is different from recurrent conditions because of the occurrences of incidents. Therefore, the recurrent expert model is trained on the train data in recurrent conditions only. For the non-recurrent expert model, we first pre-train it on the train data in recurrent conditions, and then fine-tune it on the train data in non-recurrent conditions. This training procedure for the non-recurrent model is designed for two reasons. First, the non-recurrent conditions are not as prevalent as the recurrent conditions, so the dataset size of non-recurrent conditions is not relatively small. Thus, using non-recurrent data only is not desirable for deep learning models that typically desire large datasets. Besides, we think recurrent data contain some common and general traffic patterns that may be helpful for prediction in non-recurrent conditions. In the above train, pre-train, and fine-tune processes, the quantile losses in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> are adopted.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">First, the expert models are evaluated on the recurrent and non-recurrent test datasets respectively. Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2 Model performances ‣ 5 Experiments and results ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> summarized the evaluation results. DeepAR, MVAR-R, and TFT-R are models trained on the recurrent dataset, while DeepAR-NR, MVAR-NR, and TFT-NR are trained on the non-recurrent dataset. Note that TFT-FT is a TFT model that is firstly pre-trained on the recurrent dataset and then fine-tuned on the non-recurrent dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The results of recurrent expert models show that TFT-R leads to the lowest SMAPE and RMSE. Besides, MVAR-R is worse than DeepAR-R, indicating that formulating the traffic speed prediction as a multivariate time series forecasting problem is not desirable in our study. One possible reason is that the efforts to model the correlation between time series hinder the model training efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The results of non-recurrent expert models also show the superiority of TFT models. TFT-NR and TFT-FT are the two best models. Notably, TFT-FT performs better than TFT-NR, which validates the efficacy of our proposed training pipeline for non-recurrent models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing the results of recurrent and non-recurrent, SMAPE and RMSE in non-recurrent conditions are generally higher than in recurrent conditions. This observation is expected, because traffic patterns in the non-recurrent conditions are less predictable due to the disruptive impacts of incidents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Then, the MoE model is tested on the entire test dataset. For comparison, we also train DeepAR, MVAR, and TFT models on the entire train dataset, which are denoted as DeepAR-ALL, MVAR-ALL, and TFT-ALL respectively. The results are summarized in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.2 Model performances ‣ 5 Experiments and results ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Among all baselines, TFT-ALL is the best, and our proposed MoE is better than the TFT-ALL, which proves the functionality of the proposed MoE structure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In time series forecasting problems, how the prediction errors propagate along prediction horizons is of interest. We first show the prediction errors on the entire test dataset in Figure <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Model performances ‣ 5 Experiments and results ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Among all different prediction horizons, MoE leads to the lowest SMAPE and RMSE. Besides, both types of errors increase along prediction horizons as expected, but the increased magnitude of MoE is the smallest.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In non-recurrent conditions, the prediction performances on the road segments where incidents happen are critical for proactive management to mitigate incident impacts. To this end, the models are evaluated on the incident road segments during incident occurrences, as Figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Model performances ‣ 5 Experiments and results ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows. Interestingly, DeepAR-ALL which performs well in the entire test dataset, is sometimes even worse than LOb in this test. This observation indicates that DeepAR-ALL learns to fit the main recurrent pattern and regards these incident conditions as noise. Among all models, MoE leads to the lowest SMAPE and RMSE, and the gap between MoE and other baselines is more significant than the results on the entire test dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate how MoE outperforms TFT-ALL, we give two prediction examples of TFT-ALL and MoE in the non-recurrent conditions, as Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Model performances ‣ 5 Experiments and results ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> show. In example 1, TFT-ALL and MoE both can capture the speed drop tendency caused by incidents, and predict that the speed continues to decline in the prediction horizon. However, in example 2 where the speed drop is less observable in the context window, TFT-ALL forecasts that the speed will be flat, while MoE successfully foresees the speed decrease. These examples specifically show MoE can adapt to non-recurrent conditions better than TFT-ALL.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One research question of this study is trying to answer is how traffic prediction in non-recurrent conditions differs from recurrent conditions. Interpretation of patterns learned by our proposed MoE model may give some insights.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of deep learning, attention measures how much predictions depend on different vectors. In our study, attention quantifies the temporal dependencies between predicted speed and the values in the context window. The temporal dependencies learned by MoE are plotted separately for recurrent and non-recurrent conditions, as Figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.3 Interpretation ‣ 5 Experiments and results ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> shows. In both conditions, the largest dependencies are located at the beginning and the end of the context window, indicating the model learns the tendency of past values, such as speed drop and speed recovery. Compared with recurrent conditions, non-recurrent conditions depend more on the most recent time indices. Speed in non-recurrent conditions is volatile due to occurrences of incidents, so the predictions depend more on recent values.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our models are trained on multi-source features, so we analyze the importance of various features. The variable importances are split by recurrent and non-recurrent conditions. The encoder variables include multi-source features and past speed values, while the decoder variables only contain the multi-source features. Importance percentages of the most important variables are plotted in Figure <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 5.3 Interpretation ‣ 5 Experiments and results ‣ Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. Generally, we find ’speed’ is not the most important feature, while ’link incident’, ’precipitation’, and ’hour of the day’ are the most important. This indicates traffic speed either is impacted by incidents or follows a periodic pattern. The decoder variable importance shows holidays significantly affect traffic speed as well. Comparing the decoder variable importance in the recurrent conditions with the non-recurrent conditions, we can find the ’link incident’ feature is more important in the non-recurrent conditions.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, this study presents a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that leverages recurrent and non-recurrent expert models to predict traffic states up to 30 minutes in advance. The MoE architecture allows the model to handle the diverse patterns of recurrent and non-recurrent traffic conditions, leading to superior prediction accuracy compared to baseline models. We also propose a novel training pipeline for non-recurrent models to accommodate limited data issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By interpreting the model prediction in recurrent and non-recurrent conditions separately, we shed light on the differences among two types of conditions. Future work could explore incorporating additional data sources, such as real-time incident severity information, to further enhance prediction accuracy.</p>
