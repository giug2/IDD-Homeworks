<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Wireless federated learning (WFL) enables devices to collaboratively
train a global model via local model training, uploading and aggregating.
However, WFL faces the data scarcity/heterogeneity problem (i.e.,
data are limited and unevenly distributed among devices) that degrades
the learning performance. In this regard, artificial intelligence
generated content (AIGC) can synthesize various types of data to compensate
for the insufficient local data. Nevertheless, downloading synthetic
data or uploading local models iteratively takes a lot of time, especially
for a large amount of devices. To address this issue, we propose to
leverage non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to achieve efficient
synthetic data and local model transmission. This paper is the first
to combine AIGC and NOMA with WFL to maximally enhance the learning
performance. For the proposed NOMA+AIGC-enhanced WFL, the problem
of jointly optimizing the synthetic data distribution, two-way communication
and computation resource allocation to minimize the global learning
error is investigated. The problem belongs to NP-hard mixed integer
nonlinear programming, whose optimal solution is intractable to find.
We first employ the block coordinate descent method to decouple the
complicated-coupled variables, and then resort to our analytical method
to derive an efficient low-complexity local optimal solution with
partial closed-form results. Extensive simulations validate the superiority
of the proposed scheme compared to the existing and benchmark schemes
such as the frequency/time division multiple access based AIGC-enhanced
schemes.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, due to the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, the data collected by IoT devices are needed to be analyzed
using machine learning techniques to support various IoT applications
such as augmented reality and virtual reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
However, because of the limited communication resources, it is unbearable
to transmit all of the collected data to a data center to perform
centralized machine learning. Luckily, the computing capability of
devices is surging due to the fast development of chip technology,
and it motivates to implement distributed machine learning that lets
each device train a learning model locally using its collected data.
Wireless federated learning (WFL) is one of the most famous distributed
learning framework that allows devices to collaboratively learn a
global model while protecting the data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
In WFL, devices train local models using local data independently
based on a received global model, then the trained local models are
transmitted to the WFL server for aggregating to a global model, while
the new global model is redistributed back to the devices, and the
process repeated until the global model converges. Therefore, wireless
transmission schemes affect the WFL performance greatly and need to
be tailored for WFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, due to data scarcity and heterogeneity, data are limited
and unevenly distributed among devices and some important portions
of data are missing locally at some devices, which leads to poor learning
convergence accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Therefore, to improve
global model accuracy, some measures have to be taken. For example,
device selection can be performed to select proper devices for global
model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, this will introduce
the fairness issue. Another method is to let devices collect the missing
portions of data. However, due to physical limitations, sometimes
it is difficult for the devices to collect the missing portions of
local data by themselves. Even if collecting data is possible, it
will certainly introduce much more latency and energy consumption,
which is not desirable for energy-limited devices and delay-sensitive
services. In this regard, artificial intelligence generated content
(AIGC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, which is a promising technology for
synthesizing data, can be adopted to generate synthetic data for device
local training. Specifically, AIGC can automatically create various
data such as texts, images, and videos as the devices request <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>,
and can save time and resources that may otherwise be spent on the
data collection. Since AIGC usually requires high computation capability,
it can be deployed at an AIGC server in the cloud computing center,
and devices can request the server for synthesizing specific data
and then download the synthetic data for local model training.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of WFL networks, many works such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>
have studied various important problems regarding the implementation
of WFL. Specifically, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, an algorithm for jointly
optimizing the learning, radio resource allocation and device selection
based on the Hungarian method was proposed to minimize the WFL loss
function. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the problem of joint learning
and communication resource optimization to minimize the total energy
consumption was investigated, and an iterative algorithm was proposed
to achieve a local optimal solution. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>,
the computation and the communication resources as well as the number
of the local model parameter quantization bits were jointly optimized
to minimize the WFL convergence time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, an
iterative algorithm for jointly scheduling devices, local iterations
and radio resources was developed based on the pointer network embedded
deep reinforcement learning method and the breadth-first search method.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, an incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg
game was designed to motivate the devices to participate in collaborative
model training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the above works, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>
adopted the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) wireless transmission
scheme, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> adopted the time division
multiple access (TDMA) wireless transmission scheme. Both FDMA and
TDMA belong to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission scheme.
However, OMA suffers from low transmission efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
To fully realize the potential capability of WFL, more efficient transmission
schemes other than OMA are needed. In this context, non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which
supports multiple concurrent transmissions on the same spectrum band,
is a promising technique to realize high transmission efficiency in
WFL networks. Particularly, devices can upload their local models
simultaneously using the superposition coding, and the WFL server
can decode different device signals by using the successive interference
cancellation (SIC) technique.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There have been some works on NOMA-enhanced WFL networks. Specifically,
in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, devices were assumed to be wirelessly powered
by the base station (BS), and the problem of joint optimization of
the NOMA communication and computation resources to minimize the system-wise
cost was investigated. A layered algorithm based on the monotonic
optimization was developed to solve the joint optimization problem.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the problem of jointly optimizing device
scheduling, transmit power and computation frequency allocation in
a relay-assisted NOMA-enhanced WFL network to minimize the energy
consumption was solved by graph theory. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, devices
were grouped into different NOMA groups for local model uploading,
and the transmit power and bandwidth of NOMA groups were jointly optimized
to maximize the system convergence metric based on convex optimization.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the joint optimization of device selection
and resource allocation to minimize the total training latency in
a NOMA-enhanced WFL network was carried by the monotonicity analysis
and dual decomposition method.</p>

AIGC has also been integrated with WFL in recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

focused on how WFL can empower the AIGC, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>
adopted AIGC to empower WFL. Specifically, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>,
AIGC was proposed to generate more training data for devices to minimize
the device energy consumption under the learning performance constraint.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since devices are heterogeneous and the data are limited and unevenly
distributed, AIGC can be used to generate the specified data missing
at the devices for more efficient local training and improved global
convergence performance in WFL. In this regard, the pioneer work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>
has considered to use AIGC to enhance the WFL performance. However,
the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> ignored the procedure of synthetic
data downloading from the AIGC server to the devices, the time of
which cannot be neglected in practice. In addition, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>
used a low-efficient FDMA transmission scheme for local model uploading,
which is inadequate for a large amount of devices. The above research
gaps motivate the work in this paper to use the highly efficient NOMA
transmission scheme both for synthetic data downloading and local
model uploading in AIGC-enhanced WFL networks, and jointly design
the synthetic data distribution, two-way communication resource and
computation resource allocation to maximize the learning performance.
Note that jointly designing resource optimization policy in NOMA+AIGC-enhanced
WFL networks is non-trivial, since the optimization variables are
highly coupled in such complicated non-convex optimization problems,
while the SIC decoding policy in NOMA can further complicate the optimization.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">(1) We are the first to propose a NOMA+AIGC-enhanced WFL system model,
where devices can download synthetic data from the AIGC server based
on NOMA, then train the local models based on the local data and synthetic
data, and upload the local models to the WFL server based on NOMA
for global model aggregation. The problem of jointly optimizing the
synthetic data allocation, the time allocation, the transmit power
allocation of the BS and the devices, the SIC decoding order, and
the computing frequency allocation, is formulated with the objective
of minimizing the global learning error, under various system constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">(2) We propose an efficient low-complexity algorithm with partial
closed-form results to achieve a local optimal solution to the problem.
First, we analytically derive the closed-form optimal computing frequency
allocation to simplify the problem. Then, the block coordinate descent
(BCD) method is adopted to decouple the complex problem into two simpler
subproblems. The first subproblem optimizes the synthetic data allocation
and the time allocation, where the optimal time allocation is analytical
obtained in closed form, and the optimal synthetic data allocation
is obtained via convex optimization. The second subproblem optimizes
the transmit power allocation of the BS, the transmit power of the
devices, and the SIC decoding order, where the optimal transmit power
allocation of the BS and the transmit power of the devices are analytically
obtained in a recursive form, and the optimal SIC decoding order is
analytically obtained in closed form.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">(3) Extensive simulation results are illustrated to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed NOMA+AIGC-enhanced scheme. The results
show the advantages of combining NOMA and AIGC with WFL. It is shown
that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing and benchmark schemes
such as the FDMA or TDMA+AIGC-enhanced schemes, in terms of global
learning accuracy, under various system configurations. Particularly,
the learning performance improvement of our proposed scheme is more
obvious when the data synthesizing capability of the AIGC server is
stronger, the maximum latency requirement is more stringent, and the
number of devices is larger.</p>

according to the downlink NOMA principle, the messages intended for
the devices are transmitted simultaneously based on the superposition
coding. Each device can apply SIC to cancel the messages of other

It shows that the learning
performance of the proposed NOMA+AIGC scheme outperforms all the other
schemes including FDMA+AIGC. This indicates that our proposed scheme
is more effective in improving the WFL performance. Meanwhile, it
shows that the learning performance with AIGC improves a lot compared
to that without AIGC. This is because by downloading synthetic data
from the server, more training data are available for local training
to improve the training performance. It is also shown that TDMA+AIGC
even underperforms the NOMA and the FDMA schemes without AIGC. This
is due to the fact that the devices that are unscheduled for synthetic
data downloading in TDMA shall wait and this significantly lowers
the time resource utilization and makes the maximum latency constraint
vulnerable.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, AIGC and NOMA are jointly adopted to enhance the WFL
performance. The synthetic data distribution, two-way communication
and computation resource allocation are jointly optimized to minimize
the global learning error, under various system constraints. Specifically,
an efficient low-complexity local optimal solution to the problem
with partial closed-form results is proposed based on the BCD method
and the analytical method. Extensive simulation results verify the
superiority of the proposed NOMA+AIGC-enhanced scheme compared to
the existing and benchmark schemes such as FDMA or TDMA+AIGC-enhanced
schemes, under various system configurations. Our results have demonstrated
the effectiveness of jointly combining NOMA and AIGC to enhance the
WFL performance.</p>
