<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">A key aspect of Federated Learning (FL) is the requirement of a centralized aggregator to maintain and update the global model. However, in many cases orchestrating a centralized aggregator might be infeasible due to numerous operational constraints. In this paper, we introduce BAFFLE, an aggregator free, blockchain driven, FL environment that is inherently decentralized. BAFFLE leverages Smart Contracts (SC) to coordinate the round delineation, model aggregation and update tasks in FL. BAFFLE boosts computational performance by decomposing the global parameter space into distinct chunks followed by a score and bid strategy. In order to characterize the performance of BAFFLE, we conduct experiments on a private Ethereum network and use the centralized and aggregator driven methods as our benchmark. We show that BAFFLE significantly reduces the gas costs for FL on the blockchain as compared to a direct adaptation of the aggregator based method. Our results also show that BAFFLE achieves high scalability and computational efficiency while delivering similar accuracy as the benchmark methods.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is a distributed machine learning paradigm that accomplishes large scale learning tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. FL leverages data sets localized on end user devices in order to ensure privacy. A fundamental assumption of the FL paradigm is the presence of a centralized aggregator meant to coordinate the global computational progress. An aggregator discharges four main functions in the FL paradigm. First, it is responsible for delineating the global computational process into distinct rounds. Second, it maintains a global estimate of the machine learning model to be updated after every round. Third, the aggregator selects the end user devices and sends a copy of the global model estimate to each. Lastly, the aggregator performs the critical step of updating the global model estimate based on the local copies of selected user devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The requirement of central aggregator raises operational challenges, especially in FL applications wherein the global model is of vital operational and diagnostic value to the end users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. First, in many instances, implementing a central aggregator might not be a feasible option due to logistical challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Second, end users must trust the aggregator’s selection and update mechanism for the user devices and their local models respectively. In case an aggregator holds a bias towards specific users, the final global model might not generalize well <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Third, the central aggregator results in a single point of failure for the FL task, thereby raising robustness concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Lastly, the central aggregator is typically cloud based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Access to the cloud, might be out of reach for consortia of small industries due to skill and expertise requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. As a result, a central aggregator might induce a high barrier of entry for small organizations which might be incapable of implementing large scale FL tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain based decentralization can be effectively leveraged for alleviating operational issues with respect to a centralized aggregator. However, careful consideration of the computational constraints imposed by the blockchain is required in order to realize an aggregator free FL scheme<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. First, storage of data and computation on the blockchain incurs significant costs.
Second, pushing an entire machine learning model to the blockchain becomes computationally bulky potentially incurring heavy latency due to consensus. Lastly, there are limits on transaction size imposed by the blockchain protocols that restrict the amount of data that can be stored and updated on blockchain in a single transaction. These computational constraints place limitations on the model aggregation and update process in FL. Nevertheless, the need for a scalable, low cost framework that retains the benefits of aggregator free FL while fulfilling the computational constraints of the blockchain has so far not been addressed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose BAFFLE, a blockchain based aggregator free FL environment. BAFFLE leverages SmartContracts (SCs) to maintain the global model copy and the associated computational state of the users. By its very design, BAFFLE enables users to update the global model on the SC independently and in parallel, leading to significantly lower computational costs. On the operational front, for a particular round, selection of end users in BAFFLE is based on the worth of their local updates as assessed by the SC. BAFFLE ensures that rounds are delineated according to the reported computational state of all the users thereby avoiding bias. Lastly, owing to a fully decentralized, agggregator free approach, BAFFLE saves on cloud setup and operational costs and eliminates technical expertise requirements for maintaining centralized aggregators<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Therefore, BAFFLE is able to deliver high computational efficiency while successfully eliminating the operational limitations of an aggregator driven approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">From a social standpoint, the computational benefits of BAFFLE coupled with elimination of cloud based costs and expertise requirements lowers the entry barrier for small organizations. BAFFLE can be used by micro scale organizations on public or private blockchains to self organize and leverage FL among their peers in a computationally friendly way. In doing so, each organization in a community can preserve their own data privacy but yet collaborate on building a global model that helps address challenges common to the entire community. As a result, BAFFLE can effectively be used to empower communities of users who would otherwise not have the capability to obtain robust machine learning models for their own internal challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we show that BAFFLE is able to successfully circumvent operational constraints of FL and deliver its benefits in a computationally sound manner.
BAFFLE consists of a budgeted approach towards the model update and aggregation steps and leverages SCs to delineate the rounds. We theoretically show that a classical FL scheme is equivalent to a BAFFLE driven approach with a linear relation between the respective learning rates.
We provide a practical, production level implementation of BAFFLE on a private Ethereum network, with Solidity powered SC deployments. We demonstrate the merits of BAFFLE on a real world case study using a large Deep Neural Network(DNN) model. Based on our case study, we perform exhaustive experiments to study the user benefits, robustness and scalability of BAFFLE compared to other benchmarks. Our results indicate that BAFFLE provides superior computational performance despite the highly restrictive constraints imposed by the blockchain.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Improving a global neural network model using distributed data with a privacy-preserving purpose was first studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The authors provide a scheme of jointly learning an accurate model by multiple parties for a given objective. More specifically, they consider a global shared memory model where parameters of the global model are held. Various agents participating in this framework can update a random subset of global parameters based on their local training.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning was later proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> with its theoretical basis explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The authors provide an effective method for building collective knowledge across a set of devices while preserving their individual autonomy and privacy. More recently, there have been renewed efforts to scale up the FL framework as presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Such frameworks consider multiple aggregators headed by a master in order to manage the entire FL process. Although the work proposes a distributed network of aggregators coordinated by a master, it is not inherently aggregator free.</p>

While the theoretical aspect of decentralized FL is explored in these works, numerous system and architectural issues persist in achieving true decentralization. As a result, such systemic issues need to be dealt with in order to obtain a FL framework that is feasible under practical settings.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Practical efforts to integrate AI onto the blockchain are largely confined to white paper proposals without any tangible real world implementations available. The framework proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> designs an SC based machine learning platform allowing users to upload tasks as well as contribute models to solve existing tasks. A distributed, AI computing platform has also been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> where mining nodes earn their income from processing AI models.</p>

However, owing to modification requirements to the underlying consensus protocols such approaches tend to be cumbersome to implement on off the shelf blockchain platforms. The work done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposes and implements a decentralized AI framework using the blockchain. However, a key requirement of this framework is that training data from devices needs to be published on the blockchain. As a result, the data privacy benefits of FL paradigm is eliminated. In fact, the authors note that a decentralized, blockchain based AI framework with data privacy is a key component of their future work.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most blockchain platforms have an upper limit pertaining to the data size of each transaction.
For the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the version we have used, this limit has been set to 24 kB by default.
Such a limitation immediately results in a bottleneck for an aggregator free FL scheme since the underlying machine learning models are usually significantly larger than the block sizes. Such a system induced constraint necessitates the need for partitioning the machine learning model weight vector into numerous <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chunks</span> such that each chunk size is less than the maximum transaction size. However, chunking in turn introduces a few other notable aspects with regards to model sharing that can be described as follows.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since storage on the SC is expensive, the machine learning model needs to be stored in a serialized format. However, partitioning the model after serialization could lead to inconsistencies. Therefore, for a specific FL task, it is important to first generate a partitioning scheme that must be used by all agents followed by individual serialization of the chunks. Such a <span id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chunk-and-serialize</span> scheme has numerous benefits.
First, the chunks can be read to and written from independently and seamlessly. Second, such an independence among chunks can be exploited for parallel updates from multiple devices at the same time. Lastly, a chunk independence scheme also leads to a potential scoring technique wherein parts of the model can be evaluated for their worth.

Since, pushing chunks on the blockchain involves a computational cost as well as miner fees, users can independently evaluate their own cost to benefit ratio and decide the number of chunks that they wish to update in a round. The maximum limit on the number of chunks that a user device wishes to update is referred to as the budget for that device. As a result the set of budget values from all user devices can be heterogenous in nature.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Globally, the computational process employed by BAFFLE is divided into three distinct phases. We illustrate the global computational perspective with the help of an example shown in in Figure <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 4.2 Globally Relevant Blockchain Driven FL ‣ 4 Computational Perspectives of BAFFLE ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. In our example we consider a BAFFLE system comprising of 5 asset devices A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 respectively. The model is divided into 5 chunks C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5. For this example, we consider a PL value of 4. In Phase 1, each device performs local training and aggregation to generate new bids. Next, every device attempts to submit bids for its randomly chosen chunks. The bids chronologically arrive in the order A1, A3, A5, A4 and A2. In Phase 2, owing to the PL value being met with the arrival of bids from A4, A2 is rejected from the current round. The accepted devices push the respective chunks for which their bids were accepted. In Phase 3, every device eventually signals the culmination of all its local steps to the SC to mark the end of Phase 3 as well as the current round.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A key problem in the taxi and ride sharing industry is to improve driver revenue by reducing idle time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Drivers are often unable to find passengers at certain locations in the city at varying points of time during the day due to low demand <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. As a result, they usually hover around the same location until they find a passenger. Idling time reduces vehicle utilization and leads to potential loss in revenue for the individual driver <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

Based on existing work, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheme is demonstrated to provide good quality improvement in driver revenues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. However, these approaches assume the presence of a centralized coordinator to steer the RL process. A central repository of ride information presents several privacy issues which have been successfully exploited to de-anonymize passenger information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The work done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> as an extension of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduces privacy preserving features and distributed computation as a means to improve driver revenue. However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> assumes a hierarchical computational setup that prevents all the benefits of decentralized computations from being realized in their entirety. The requirements of multiple control centres to perform the learning tasks leads to limited applicability of such approaches.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The taxi and ride sharing industry is a perfect example of micro scale enterprises that could benefit significantly from an aggregator free FL approach. The ride sharing and taxi industry remains largely an unorganized market where setting up a trusted coordinator remains a challenging proposition. Even in case of a central data repository, extracting intelligence from the anonymized data proves to be a futile exercise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, drivers usually also do not have access to sophisticated computing platforms on which they could orchestrate learning tasks to improve their revenue. Therefore, a decentralized aggregator free FL environment allows drivers to leverage their collective ride experiences and improve their revenue without sharing their private ride data itself.</p>

Specifically, we randomly chose 2 million rides pertaining to May 2018 which was divided into two equal parts to denote the training and testing data sets.

We perform a benchmark study where we compare the potential benefits from BAFFLE with respect to classical FL as well as other non FL paradigms. Next, we examine the trends arising from varying number of chunks as well as budget sizes of user devices. We then move onto a scalability analysis that demonstrates the impact of varying the total number of active user devices on the model quality. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of BAFFLE to the participation level (PL) parameter of BAFFLE.

<p id="S6.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the basis of Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table IV ‣ 6.3 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, we conclude that time incurred for training is marginal compared to the push time depicted in Figure <a href="#S6.F3.sf2" title="Figure 3(b) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 6.3 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a> for all combinations of budget and chunk sizes. The relatively small training time implies that reducing the total push time is critical in ensuring a computationally efficient performance for a blockchain based FL mechanism. We can therefore draw upon the trends shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 6.3 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> to reveal numerous key insights which elucidate the high computational efficiency of BAFFLE.</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Primarily, in Figure <a href="#S6.F3.sf1" title="Figure 3(a) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 6.3 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a> we observe a smaller variation in gas costs for the 2 kB chunk size irrespective of budget sizes. However, as the chunk size increases we see the variation in gas costs also increase substantially for all budget sizes. Second, despite the increased variation, the mean gas cost appears to saturate for higher chunk sizes. We also observe that for the budget size of 32 after the initial uptick there is a relatively more pronounced downward trend for higher chunk sizes.
This trend can be clearly attributed to the scoring and bidding mechanism incorporated in BAFFLE. Since a higher chunk size implies lesser number of chunks, there is relatively more competition among user devices to update the same set of chunks. As a result for higher chunk sizes, only user devices which are able to consistently contribute higher scoring chunks will incur a higher gas cost. Therefore, owing to its underlying scoring and bidding mechanism, BAFFLE is able to achieve significant savings in gas costs for the users. Lastly, we observe that in Figure <a href="#S6.F3.sf2" title="Figure 3(b) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 6.3 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a> despite the budget size increasing, the total push time increases only marginally owing to the scoring and bidding mechanisms. Therefore, we can safely say that BAFFLE is successfully able to circumvent the computational bottleneck posed by the push step of BAFFLE .</p>

However, the convergence characteristics of BAFFLE with a 5% PL value closely mirrors the RandomDFL case. Overall, the trends in Figure <a href="#S6.F5.sf1" title="Figure 5(a) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.5 Participation Level (PL) Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a> generally indicate that a lower PL value leads to a faster convergence. Figure <a href="#S6.F5.sf2" title="Figure 5(b) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.5 Participation Level (PL) Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a> shows that a lower PL value in BAFFLE incurs a lower gas cost as well. Trends similar to Figure <a href="#S6.F5.sf2" title="Figure 5(b) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.5 Participation Level (PL) Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(b)</span></a> are also exhibited in Figure <a href="#S6.F5.sf3" title="Figure 5(c) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.5 Participation Level (PL) Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(c)</span></a> wherein a lower PL value in BAFFLE corresponds to a lower total push time as well. We observe that in general, BAFFLE incurs barely half the gas cost and push time as compared to the RandomDFL case. In fact, BAFFLE outperforms the RandomDFL case by a factor of more than 2 with a PL value of 5% both in terms of the gas cost as well as the push time. Since fewer devices are pushing to the global model copy every round, the chances of multiple devices pulling the same global model is significantly higher in case of a lower PL value. This leads to greater stability in the decentralized process which ultimately leads to a faster convergence for a low PL value as shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F5.sf1" title="Figure 5(a) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 6.5 Participation Level (PL) Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S6.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">BAFFLE incurs significantly lower gas costs compared to the RandomDFL case owing to minimization of redundant updates. Due to the decentralized round delineation and a robust scoring and bidding process, devices only push chunks that are among the best in the round. As a result, collision among devices for the same chunk is completely eliminated leading to a much lower gas cost and push time.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we investigate the use of the blockchain for realizing a decentralized aggregator free FL mechanism. We design and develop BAFFLE, a custom made blockchain based framework for aggregator free FL. In our framework, we successfully eliminate the role of a centralized aggregator by effectively decentralizing the concepts of round delineation, user device selection and model aggregation with the help of an SC. Further, in order to circumvent the computational restrictions imposed by the blockchain, we employ an effective model partitioning and serialization mechanism that enables independent and parallel model updates. We orchestrate BAFFLE on a private Ethereum blockchain network with a Solidity driven SC implementation. We argue that the operational and computational benefits of aggregator free FL has significant potential for solving business problems for micro scale enterprises. We support our claims by applying BAFFLE to a case study pertaining to the ride sharing and taxi industry which serves as a perfect example of a micro scale enterprise. Our case study utilizes the BAFFLE framework to improve driver revenue based on a DRL model that is collectively augmented by all drivers using FL. We show that BAFFLE yields approximately a 40% improvement in driver revenues compared to non FL approaches. We further show that despite being aggregator free, BAFFLE’s result quality matches that of classical FL schemes that require investment in an aggregator. Moreover, BAFFLE performs significantly better compared to other aggregator free approaches that are inspired by the current state of the art.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our work shows that an aggregator free approach to FL offers significant potential for revolutionizing small scale organizations and their businesses by delivering quality machine learning models at lower costs. Driven by a robust decentralized platform like the blockchain, the benefits of FL could impact a variety of domains leading to widespread adoption. The issue of aggregator free FL opens up new avenues for research especially in the blockchain domain. Therefore, our future work is driven by the desire to incorporate other machine learning paradigms as well as differential privacy into BAFFLE. Incorporating an aggregator free FL for complex paradigms like CNNs and LSTMs will go a long way to enable wider adoption of FL.</p>

It starts with observation of a new ride set every epoch. For every ride in the ride set, the existing Q-value estimate is updated with the fare collected for the ride and a discounted future reward. The discounted future reward is based on the action that gives highest Q value originating from the destination state. Based on the observed set of rides, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to calculate the next Q function estimate.</span></p>
