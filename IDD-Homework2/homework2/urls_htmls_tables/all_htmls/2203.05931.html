<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">As Deep Learning algorithms continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, they require massive datasets for model training and efficacy of models. Some of those data requirements can be met with the help of existing datasets within the organizations.
Current Machine Learning practices can be leveraged to generate synthetic data from an existing dataset. Further, it is well established that diversity in generated synthetic data relies on (and is perhaps limited by) statistical properties of available dataset within a single organization or entity.
The more diverse an existing dataset is, the more expressive and generic synthetic data can be. However, given the scarcity of underlying data, it is challenging to collate big data in one organization. The diverse, non-overlapping dataset across distinct organizations provides an opportunity for them to contribute their limited distinct data to a larger pool that can be leveraged to further synthesize. Unfortunately, this raises data privacy concerns that some institutions may not be comfortable with.</p>
<p id="id9.id2" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel approach to generate synthetic data - <span id="id9.id2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSyn</span>. FedSyn is a collaborative, privacy preserving approach to generate synthetic data among multiple participants in a federated and collaborative network.
FedSyn creates a synthetic data generation model, which can generate synthetic data consisting of statistical distribution of almost all the participants in the network.
FedSyn does not require access to the data of an individual participant, hence protecting the privacy of participant’s data.
The proposed technique in this paper leverages federated machine learning and generative adversarial network (GAN) as neural network architecture for synthetic data generation.
The proposed method can be extended to many machine learning problem classes in finance, health, governance, technology and many more.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Back in 2017, The Economist published a story titled, ”The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data.” Since then data has continued to be one of the most critical and valuable asset in industry today, where we see innovative and complex machine learning algorithms and architectures, which are dependent on a plethora of data for training, testing, mining and designing ‘data-centric’ statistical algorithms<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In many organizations, big data is mined with robust data engineering pipelines, which allows them to create sufficient datasets to train machine learning and deep learning models.
Scarcity of data can be a big challenge to application of machine learning for organizations or entities which are not able to mine big data.
Though transfer learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> may help, it does not cater to all the needs as they are generally designed over public data.
In few cases, even organizations with abundant data may find some bias in their dataset because of various reasons, resulting in biased and non-generic machine learning models with limited variance in available data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">GAN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> have emerged as one of the prominent neural network architectures to generate synthetic data. The architecture can be modified to accommodate various data signals. Since discriminator and generator models compete with each other in an adversarial game to generate synthetic data as close as possible to original data, the quality of synthetic data is directly dependent on training data used. Generative Adversarial Networks trained on available data can help generate data required for training machine learning models in organizations.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In financial, health care and Internet of Things industries, recent trends<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> have indicated an increase in collaboration among organizations to benefit from data of their peers in their respective industries. To draw a hypothetical scenario, different financial organizations have varying concentration of their business operations in different geographical distributions. This in turn results in the concentration of a specific dataset in those locations. Localized regional data would certainly be valuable to other regions that can leverage it for training their local models for developing intelligent solutions, including anomaly detection, potential payment fraudulent in case of cross border payments etc. However, considering data privacy laws and governance on data accessibility within industry it may be challenging to share such data across regions. In such cases, it may be possible to share the local models across regions that can augment other regional models. To extend it further, the proposed method in this paper can be implemented for greater research opportunities to obtain powerful and global machine learning models.</p>

Though collaboration is required, <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data privacy</span> must be honoured.
Generating synthetic data is a strategic way to proceed, where challenges to data scarcity could be solved, but data bias would still be observed, since synthetic data generation models would be trained on existing data only. The experiments in this paper demonstrate generation of synthetic data in a privacy preserving and collaborative manner.</p>

FedSyn proposes a novel method, in which federated learning, synthetic data generation using GAN and differential privacy are combined as a framework. For solving the challenge of data scarcity, generative adversarial networks are being used to generate synthetic data after being trained upon existing data. Federated learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> provides privacy of data as well as that of underlying data of participants in collaborative network, with aggregation algorithm executed on <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">non-IID data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a><span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span>. This essentially tries to solve the problem of data bias, as aggregated models from federated server builds on learning from individual participants. To extend data privacy and anonymity guarantee even further, FedSyn implements differential privacy by adding Laplacian noise<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to model parameters.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, differential privacy is defined as a method to protect privacy of underlying data and statistical properties, which can be potentially leaked from models. The core idea is to add noise onto training data, which would be added to model parameters and learnt indirectly, since the data used for training is modified.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the current work, differential privacy is implemented by adding noise to model parameters, rather than data. Doing this adds noise to generator weight layers, which are responsible for generating latent space for synthetic images<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Adding noise to model parameters of generator adds noise to latent space in multi-dimensional hyper-sphere, effecting synthetic images itself, hence providing similar benefits as of adding noise to data itself. This approach also makes it computationally favourable for all the participants. Laplacian noise is added to the model parameters before they are sent from participant server to aggregation server. Use of Laplacian noise is favourable over Gaussian noise, as the resultant model parameters are quantitatively less distorted compared to Gaussian noise. Even after that, privacy guarantees are better for Laplacian noise<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Below equation shows how the noise from each participant is accumulated at federated aggregated server. One can observe that noise from each participant is added together and propagated further in aggregated model parameters, and subsequent federated learning rounds.</p>

<p id="S4.p6.4" class="ltx_p">Though quantitative metric for GANs is still an active area of research, Frechet Inception Distance (FID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> is a metric which calculates distance between feature vector of base images and synthetically generated images. FID scores have been also used several other works<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> related to synthetic data generation using federated learning. Lesser the FID score, better is the quality of synthetic images generated. In our case, base images are the synthetic images generated by a GAN model, which is trained over all the MNIST and CIFAR10 data, centrally (in two separate experiments). Thus, central GAN model forms the upper bound for synthetic images generated with FedSyn.

As it can be observed, the images generated from global generator model, created after using aggregated model parameters from federated learning round consists of images from all the 10 labels (handwritten digits).
Whereas, individual participants have been trained on fraction of total labels. Also, aggregator server does not have access to all the data points, but the aggregated model parameters is capable of generating synthetic data from all the labels.
This observation supports the claim of using FedSyn on non-IID data with Laplacian noise for differential privacy on local generator model parameters, which has been proposed in this paper.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Growing need for data intensive, deep learning models across industries is the key driver for collaboration among enterprise and participants. The key challenges faced here are data privacy, data scarcity and data bias.
In the current work, Privacy preserving method like federated learning along with synthetic data generation using GAN is implemented to create <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSyn</span> framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedSyn tries to solve the data privacy challenge with federated learning where the original data is never shared for GAN training, but model parameters are shared, after applying differential privacy with Laplacian noise.
Federated learning with non-IID data among participants of network, minimizes the risk of data bias while aggregating the local model parameters.
Data scarcity among certain participants are observed, because of imbalanced train size or data availability. Federated learning framework with synthetic data generation could solve that issue for participants with lesser data resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Through experiments, it has been observed that quality of synthetic data generation is dependent on the degree of noise being added for differential privacy. For differential privacy, noise is added to model parameters as opposed to adding to original data. With federated learning, the results of experiments have shown that aggregated models after federated learning are capable of generating synthetic data of all the labels, without accessing any data for training. This further strengthens the claim of using FedSyn for non-IID data.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The research presented in this paper can also be extended further to quantify energy consumption of federated learning models, compared to centralized models, which can be the direction towards sustainable machine learning. Study can be extended to identify classes of problems, where federated learning techniques can be employed and can perform better, along with low carbon footprint. This can be further studied to identify key parameters of federated learning for energy consumption like energy consumed during communication, upload/download of model parameters, training at edge and aggregations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.
