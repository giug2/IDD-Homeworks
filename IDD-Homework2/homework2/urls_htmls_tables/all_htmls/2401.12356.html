<p id="id20.id1" class="ltx_p">In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), decentralized paradigms for machine learning are gaining prominence. In this paper, we introduce a federated learning model that capitalizes on the Euclidean distance between device model weights to assess their similarity and disparity. This is foundational for our system, directing the formation of coalitions among devices based on the closeness of their model weights. Furthermore, the concept of a barycenter, representing the average of model weights, helps in the aggregation of updates from multiple devices. We evaluate our approach using homogeneous and heterogeneous data distribution, comparing it against traditional federated learning averaging algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in offering structured, outperformed and communication-efficient model for IoT-based machine learning.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in a new era of connectivity, with billions of devices from wearables and smartphones to industrial sensors and smart home appliances interacting in complex networks. These devices continuously generate vast amounts of data, offering unprecedented opportunities for data-driven insights and machine learning applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, the traditional paradigm of centralizing this data for processing and analysis is increasingly being challenged. Concerns related to bandwidth consumption, latency, privacy breaches, and the sheer volume of data make centralized approaches less feasible and efficient. This is where Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a promising alternative.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that allows devices, or ”nodes”, to train models on their local data without sharing the raw data itself. Instead of sending data to a central server, nodes process data locally and only transmit model updates or gradients to a central entity. This not only preserves user privacy by keeping sensitive data on the device but also reduces the bandwidth required for data transmission, making it particularly suitable for IoT scenarios where devices might be constrained by limited connectivity or power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the adoption of FL in the IoT landscape is not without challenges. One of the most significant challenges is heterogeneity. In the vast and diverse world of IoT, devices differ widely in terms of computational capabilities, storage, power availability, and even the nature and distribution of the data they hold. For instance, data from a wearable health monitor will be vastly different from that of a smart thermostat. This non-IID (independent and identically distributed) nature of data across nodes can lead to disparities in local model updates, which, when aggregated at the central server, can adversely affect the global model’s accuracy and convergence rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the computational heterogeneity among devices means that while some devices can compute updates rapidly, others might lag, leading to asynchronous updates. This asynchronicity can introduce challenges in aggregating updates and ensuring that the global model remains current and relevant for all participating nodes. In essence, as the IoT ecosystem continues its exponential growth, the need for decentralized learning mechanisms like FL becomes increasingly evident. However, the inherent heterogeneity of this ecosystem poses unique challenges that need to be addressed to harness the full potential of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Through strategic approaches like coalition formation, there is potential to navigate these challenges and pave the way for more efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving machine learning in the IoT domain.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">One potential strategy to navigate the challenges posed by heterogeneity is the concept of coalition formation. By allowing devices to form strategic groups or ”coalitions” based on similarities in data distribution, computational capabilities, or other criteria, it might be possible to create more homogeneous subgroups. These coalitions can then train local models that are more representative of their specific data distributions, leading to more accurate and robust global models when these local updates are aggregated.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of Federated Learning has been extensively studied in recent years. A seminal work by researchers highlighted the challenges of communication in federated learning, emphasizing the need for structured and sketched updates to mitigate uplink communication costs and enhance efficiency. This work laid the foundation for subsequent studies that sought to integrate federated learning into various domains, such as internet of things. In this context, the decentralized training approach was underscored for its ability to maintain user data privacy, a critical concern in mobile applications. Furthermore, the applicability of federated learning was extended to the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Comprehensive surveys in this domain emphasized the significance of decentralized learning in connected devices, addressing challenges and charting future directions for federated learning in IoT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly evolving, with Machine Learning (ML) driving significant advancements in the realm of data communication for intelligent devices. Within this IoT framework, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a decentralized approach, with its application spanning across a myriad of IoT gadgets. While FL has gained considerable traction, many of its algorithms operate on the presumption that client nodes are trustworthy and collaborative during model training. However, real-world applications reveal that nodes can be deceptive or uncooperative. In this context, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> introduces ”DistFL”, an innovative FL algorithm designed to thwart biased training by pinpointing malicious nodes during the training process, setting it apart from traditional FL methodologies. Concurrently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> delves deeper into the FL paradigm, particularly contrasting the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Personalized Federated Averaging (Per-FedAvg) strategies. Their analysis accentuates the pivotal role data heterogeneity plays in the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when data is Non-Identically and Independently Distributed (Non-IID). Notably, in scenarios of pronounced data disparity, Per-FedAvg showcases enhanced resilience and performance. This highlights the need for tailored FL strategies in an IoT context, ensuring efficient and robust decentralized learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The fusion of Federated Learning and game theory has been a subject of interest in recent research. One of the notable works in this domain is the DIM-DS model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which introduces a dynamic incentive mechanism based on evolutionary game theory to model users’ behavior in data sharing. The model also introduces ”credibility coins” as a novel cryptocurrency for data-sharing transactions, emphasizing the importance of trust and incentives in federated systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another significant contribution is the Towards Bilateral Client Selection in Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which proposes an intelligent client selection approach for federated learning on IoT devices using matching game theory. This approach surpasses traditional federated learning client selection methods by optimizing both the revenues of client devices and the accuracy of the global federated learning model.
The FedGame framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is another noteworthy mention, designed to secure Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications leveraging FL. This framework evaluates its accuracy against centralized ML/DL schemes, emphasizing not only the privacy of industrial systems but also its efficiency in providing required resources to counter IIoT attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning facilitates the joint training of machine learning models by enabling collaboration between an aggregation server and various clients, all while preserving data privacy. However, this privacy-centric approach renders the FL structure susceptible to potentially harmful model updates, primarily since the server perceives clients as opaque entities. Such a setup, compounded by vast heterogeneous data, magnifies security vulnerabilities and may degrade model performance. Despite the significance, the ramifications of client selection and data heterogeneity on FL’s resilience are often understated. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the authors introduced the Incentive Design for Heterogeneous Client Selection (IHCS) to bolster performance and mitigate security concerns. IHCS innovatively leverages cooperative game theory and dynamic client clustering based on data heterogeneity. By assigning a unique Shapley Value-derived recognition to each client, it refines client participation probabilities. Furthermore, our incorporation of a heterogeneity-focused clustering technique, known as HIC, counters the adverse effects of data diversity, enhancing the overall contributions from client.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of IoT devices has unveiled a vast reservoir of IoT data. ML models leveraging this data are instrumental in monitoring vital environmental parameters such as air quality and climate change. Traditional centralized ML models, however, consolidate data from all clients at one central location, compromising user privacy. Federated Learning (FL), an alternative, prioritizes user privacy by training models on dispersed data sets. Yet, FL grapples with a heterogeneity challenge, often favoring some data sources at the expense of others. To address this, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> introduce a central server, fortified by reinforcement learning (RL), that discerns data disparities. This server, within the FL framework, gauges collaborative benefits by interpreting patterns in diverse client feedback. By iteratively adjusting client weights, it strives to achieve a coalition of clients that delivers near-optimal performance.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of the Internet of Things has ushered in a new era of interconnected devices, from smart thermostats in homes to intricate sensors in industrial settings. These devices, while constantly collecting and processing data, are often constrained in terms of computational power and memory. Our model introduces a decentralized paradigm, leveraging federated learning, tailored specifically for the IoT ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Central to our approach is the use of the Euclidean distance between the weights of local device models. In the vast expanse of the IoT, where devices are continuously learning and adapting, each device’s model weights can be conceptualized as vectors in a high-dimensional space. The Euclidean distance between these vectors serves as a metric to measure the similarity or disparity between two models. A smaller distance implies that the models are close, while a larger distance denotes significant differences. This metric is foundational for our system, guiding the formation of coalitions among devices based on the proximity of their model weights.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To further refine the aggregation of updates from multiple devices, we employ the concept of a barycenter. In this context, the barycenter symbolizes the average of model weights across a subset of devices. It acts as a central point in the weight space, encapsulating the collective learning of a group of devices. This is especially pivotal when performing federated averaging across multiple devices in the IoT network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our model ensures that devices, based on the similarity of their local models, are grouped into coalitions. These coalitions then collaboratively contribute to a global model, minimizing communication overheads, making it a promising approach for the future of IoT-based machine learning.</p>

This dataset comprises 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) with dimensions of 28 × 28 pixels. For the purpose of training and evaluation, the dataset was divided into 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. The data was further segmented into 10 parts, each containing 6,000 samples. These samples were distributed among clients in an IID manner as well as heterogenous and highly heterogenous manner, ensuring each client had 600 samples for every class.

Two max-pooling layers (pool1 and pool2) with a 2x2 kernel and a stride of 2.
Two fully connected layers (fc1 and fc2) with 512 neurons and 10 neurons respectively. The latter corresponds to the 10 classes of the MNIST dataset.
The forward pass involved reshaping the input tensor, passing it through convolutional layers, max-pooling, and then the fully connected layers to produce class logits.
This model is a typical representation of CNN architectures used for image classification tasks, leveraging convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling for spatial reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.

<p id="S4.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the homogeneous dataset shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-F Discussion ‣ IV Simulation and Numerical Results ‣ Efficient Collaborations through Weight-Driven Coalition Dynamics in Federated Learning Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, both methodologies exhibited impressive performance metrics, particularly in terms of model accuracy. Convergence was achieved swiftly, revealing stability in accuracy as the communication rounds advanced. The uniform nature of the dataset clearly favors decentralized learning strategies due to consistent data distribution across nodes. Yet, even in these conditions, the slight edge FL with Coalitions held demonstrated its potential robustness in the aggregation process, possibly alluding to the benefits of coalition-driven dynamics.

The standard FedAvg displayed higher fluctuations in accuracy during initial communication rounds, gradually achieving stability. In contrast, FL with Coalitions showcased a consistent upward trajectory in accuracy, suggesting its adeptness in managing data variance. The relative stability of this coalition-based approach highlights its proficiency in addressing the challenges of data disparity, potentially by capitalizing on the collective strength of nodes with similar data.

Both methodologies grappled with the data’s disparate nature, but it was the FL with Coalitions that maintained controlled accuracy ascents, demonstrating its resilience. Meanwhile, the standard FedAvg showcased pronounced volatility, reflecting its limitations in such environments. This superior performance of FL with Coalitions indicates its adaptability and suggests that its mechanism, possibly its nuanced approach to clustering similar nodes, mitigates the impact of pronounced data disparities.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our exploration into the field of federated learning for the IoT domain led to the design of a decentralized learning model leveraging the Euclidean distance between model weights of individual devices. The results highlight the efficiency of our proposed model in forming coalitions among devices based on the similarity of their model weights. The use of a barycenter to represent the average model weights has also shown to be effective for aggregating updates from several devices. By conducting our experiments, we provided a comprehensive comparison between the conventional FedAvg algorithm and our federated learning approach using coalition formation . Our findings underscore the significance of utilizing such techniques in the IoT context, minimized communication overheads, and efficient learning.
