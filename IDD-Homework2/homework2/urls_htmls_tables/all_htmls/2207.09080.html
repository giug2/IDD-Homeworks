<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning paradigm, has been adapted to mitigate privacy concerns of clients. Attributing to its advancement, institutions (i.e., hospitals) with sensitive data leverage FL to collaboratively train a global model without transmitting their raw data. Despite attractive, there exists various inference attacks that can exploit the shared plaintext model updates embedding traces of clients private information, causing severe privacy concerns.
To alleviate such privacy concerns, cryptographic techniques such as secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption have been incorporated for privacy-preserving FL. However, this inevitably exacerbates security concerns once clients are malicious to launch attacks, in particular, corrupting the model to ruin the main impetus of benign clients in FL. Those benign clients aim to gain a better global model by contributing their computational and communicational resources and their local data for local model updates. Such security issues in privacy-preserving FL, however, lack elucidation and are under-explored.
This work presents the first attempt towards elucidating the trivialness of performing model corruption attacks against lightweight secret sharing based privacy-preserving FL. We consider the scenario where the model updates are <span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">quantized</span> to reduce the communication overhead in this case, the adversary can simply provide local parameters out of the small legitimate range to corrupt the model.
We then propose MUD-PQFed, a protocol that can precisely detect malicious clients who performed the attack and enforce fair punishments. By deleting the contributions from the detected malicious clients, the global model utility is preserved as comparable to the baseline global model in absence of the attack. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy in terms of retaining the baseline accuracy and effectiveness in terms of detecting malicious clients in a fine-grained manner.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> is one of the most popular distributed machine learning techniques. It aims to mitigate the privacy concerns when sensitive data has to be aggregated by a centralized training party to train models in the conventional centralized training paradigm.
FL collaboratively trains a global model among multiple clients without accessing the local raw data, and thus greatly motivates distributed clients to contribute to gain a global model with better performance than that being trained merely on its limited local data. This is especially the case for the cross-silo FL where all clients will participate in each round of aggregation, instead of only selecting a fraction of clients to participate in each round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
This is particularly suitable for the clients that are institutional organizations (i.e., hospitals) with limited data at local and wish to collaboratively train a more accurate model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to obtain higher accuracy and encourage more clients with high-quality resources (e.g., data, computing resources) to contribute to FL, incentive mechanisms are always taken into FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposes an effective incentive mechanism combining reputation and contract theory to motivate clients with high-quality data to participate in FL. In the meantime, in order to prevent malicious clients or low-quality clients intentionally degrading the aggregation quality, it is also important to punish these clients. Therefore, incentive schemes for FL should not only reward honest clients, but also penalize malicious clients once being identified <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Privacy Inference Attack.</span> In each round of the FL training, each client independently updates the local model trained over its local data, and transmits the updated local model to the central server who serves as a coordinator. The server aggregates all local models and updates the global model through, e.g., <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">FedAvg</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Albeit the FL can greatly mitigate privacy leakages from the raw data, it is still vulnerable to advanced privacy inference attacks such as membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, data inversion attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, property inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and preference profiling attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> when the local model communicates in plaintext with the server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Communication Overhead.</span> Generally, a local model’s parameters are downloaded/uploaded in full-precision by default, which results in large communication overhead to the FL. The overhead is further exacerbated in a scenario where a large number of clients are involved, and each local model contains millions or even tens of millions of parameters, rendering somehow unbearable communication overhead.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A practical solution to the excessive communication overhead caused by full-precision parameters in FL is to quantize the parameters, namely quantized FL. As such, ternary FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and ultimately binary FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> have recently been proposed to substantially reduce the communication overhead. In addition, <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">an inadvertent security merit of the quantized FL is that it has constrained the legitimate parameter change degree</span> if an malicious client does tamper the parameters <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">in plaintext</span>. For example, tenary parameter can only have three legitimate values {-1, 0, 1}, which restricts the legitimate parameter manipulation degree.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Security Dilemma of Cryptographic Privacy-Preserving FL.</span> In order to fundamentally protect clients’ privacy (e.g., preventing privacy inference attacks), cryptographic designs have been proposed in which model parameters are encrypted into ciphertext and the aggregation is also performed over ciphertexts to prevent direct access to local model parameters in plaintext, no matter whether the FL is in full-precision  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> or quantized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, such cryptographic aggregation designs render security attacks much easier, e.g., corrupting the global model convergence to cause denial of service (DoS). As the privacy-preserving FL designs are merely focusing on privacy but not security attack perspective, the security dilemma of the privacy-preserving FL is much less elucidated (see details in Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="2.1 Federated Learning ‣ 2 Background ‣ MUD-PQFed: Towards Malicious User Detection in Privacy-Preserving Quantized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Privacy-Preserving Quantized FL.</span> Although it greatly reduces communication overhead, it is inevitably threatened by security attacks, resulting in worrisome deployments. This is exacerbated by the fact that the malicious clients can easily corrupt the model without obeying the legitimate parameter range.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Consider ternary FL as an example,
since the parameters are values from {-1, 0, 1}, malicious clients only need to make some illegitimate changes, such as changing -1 to -5, which will affect the correctness of the aggregated model such as preventing the global model from converging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">It is imperative to identify malicious clients in the quantized privacy-preserving FL, then remove and penalize them to ensure the utility of the global model without falsely punishing normal clients. However, there is no existing robust privacy-preserving FL scheme that has considered such <span id="S1.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">trivial but realistic model corruption</span> attack caused by illegitimate parameter unique to <span id="S1.p10.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">quantized FL</span>.</p>

MUD-PQFed works for the quantized privacy-preserving FL where the local model parameters are in the form of ciphertexts. In addition, MUD-PQFed can efficiently mitigate the attack effects by removing the detected malicious clients’ poisoned (alike fault injection to some extent) local models.

A small change (e.g., the number of model parameters or/and the degree per parameter) will have a substantial impact on the accuracy of the global model, and thus make it completely corrupted.</p>

Finally, the ciphertext encrypted by BGV is embedded in the augmented learning with error (A-LWE) ciphertext (called external ciphertext) to realize the secure FL aggregation protocol.

The ShieldFL is based on secure cosine similarity on encrypted local gradients to distinguish malicious clients from normal clients. However, both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> are based on privacy protection under HE, which will undoubtedly lead to very large overhead (i.e., violates the motivation of reducing communication overhead of quantized FL focused in this work) and the scalability for the number of clients is not high. In addition, even if malicious clients can be detected, both schemes leak other information about clients (such as Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine similarity), which may lead to other potential attacks such as data inversion attack and model stealing attack recognized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Moreover, these two studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> build upon two (non-colluding) servers, which interact with clients and communicate with each other to carry out a secure two-party protocol. Such a two-server setting is different from the common one-server FL setting.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, communication overhead is an important issue that could be a severe bottleneck if the available bandwidth is restricted. This is because in FL, the number of clients could be very large, such as millions of smartphones. When full-precision parameters are used to transmit gradient information in the communication process, the large number of clients will incur unbearable communication overhead.
Besides, a large number of parameters are communicated between the server and the client, but the throughput of the communication channel is limited <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Moreover, as aforementioned, in order to protect the privacy of the FL aggregation process, some schemes adopt homomorphic encryption  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> or secure multiparty computation (SMC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> for privacy protection, which exacerbates the communication overhead.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, in order to reduce communication overhead and alleviate channel bandwidth pressure and throughput, quantized FL emerges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.

The T-FedAvg protocol proposed by Xu <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> quantizes the gradient to -1, 0 and 1 through a layer-by-layer quantization method, which greatly reduces the communication overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Yang <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed the first binary FL framework. They utilize maximum likelihood estimation and auxiliary real-valued parameters to update gradient information. So they can enable binary state learning and reducing communication costs. Accuracy drop due to parameter binarization can be compensated by mixed-precision FL.</p>

In addition, secure computation techniques can complement the quantized FL to fundamentally mitigate the privacy leakages. However, the security threats rooted in the cryptography based privacy-preserving quantized FL is not explored and elucidated. We here show that quantized FL unique model corruption attack via tampering the local model parameter in an illegitimate range is realistic and trivial. Such manipulation, unless carefully treated, can be easily achieved in the ciphertext domain.
Therefore, it is imperative to design a protocol to detect malicious clients in the quantized FL under ciphertext form, while retaining the lightweight feature of the quantized FL. Later we devise MUD-PQFed in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 The Design of MUD-PQFed ‣ MUD-PQFed: Towards Malicious User Detection in Privacy-Preserving Quantized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> to cater for this critical demand.</p>

Obviously, the more clients there are, the smaller the impact a single malicious client can cause, so the accuracy will decrease slowly. Similarly, a malicious client in the ciphertext state can perform the same operation to compromise the global model and evade the illegitimate range check.</p>

<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Hardness of Malicious Client Detection.</span> Intuitively, it seems that for the quantized FL that only uses secure multi-party computation to achieve secure aggregation to output a global model, the server can determine whether each aggregated model parameter is within a reasonable threshold, and then determine whether there are malicious clients. However, this may not easily hold in practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">For example, for binary FL, the parameter value is either 0 or 1. If 100 clients participate in the quantized FL and each client submits 1000 parameters, then the aggregated result should be in [0, 100] for each parameter.
If the quantized FL is in plaintext, the server can determine whether there are malicious clients by checking whether the local parameter range is in [0, 100] per parameter per client. But this per parameter per client check is prohibited in ciphertext state. In addition, the attacker can hide the maliciously injected value within the normal range of [0, 100], e.g., by estimating the tampered parameter firstly. More specifically, the attacker can tamper with the parameter that has a higher chance to be 0 sent by majority of clients. In this context, the aggregated parameter will be still within legitimate range, rendering infeasibility of detecting malicious behavior. Even though the aggregated value does exceed normal ranges, the server can only determine that there are malicious behaviors, but cannot identify which client is malicious because the server can only examine the aggregated value from all clients in the MPC (in particular, using secret sharing) enabled privacy-preserving quantized FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As for quantized FL that uses homomorphic encryption for FL privacy protection, it is more vulnerable to such security attacks. Because the server cannot know the plaintext value of the aggregated value opposed to the MPC-based FL aggregation, thereof, it is infeasible to tell whether there are malicious clients relying on the aggregated values in ciphertext. For this reason, when designing MUD-PQFed, we choose to use MPC rather than HE, as the latter exacerbates the hardness of malicious client detection in addition to its higher computational and communicational overhead.</p>

MUD-PQFed is able to identify malicious clients in coarse-grained means and fine-grained means. The former means that the server can localize the malicious behaviors in a specific subset/group of clients, while the latter ultimately identifies the exact malicious clients. The fine-grained detection is more preferred from the incentive perspective, as the exact malicious clients will be penalized, instead of a subset/group of clients that may also consist of benign clients.</p>

A total of 16 submitted values need to be deleted.
Although two malicious clients have deleted 4 more submitted values when they are in different groups, there are still 16 remaining submitted values, which retains to be same as the number of submitted values of the baseline.
It can be understood that the number of submitted values is ’saturated’. In other words, after removing 3 groups of submitted values, 20 commits are ’over saturated’ when two malicious clients are in the same group. Therefore, our solution achieves the best accuracy in both cases of malicious clients in the same group and different groups, and there is no global model accuracy gap after malicious clients removal.</p>

It can be observed that the tendency is similar to the accuracy tendency of the case when there is only one malicious client.
One malicious client changes 18,432 parameters, which is only 1.6% out of the total number of 1,166,176 parameters, so when the number of malicious clients is 2, the accuracy does not drop to the point of being irrecoverable like the MNIST dataset.
Nonetheless, the application of MUD-PQFed effectively eliminates the attack effects. Same as the MNIST, Fig. <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 6.2.1 Ternary FL ‣ 6.2 Accuracy Evaluation ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ MUD-PQFed: Towards Malicious User Detection in Privacy-Preserving Quantized Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> depicts the accuracy with/without applying MUD-PQFed for CIFAR-10. Similarly, we can see that if malicious clients are not removed, once malicious clients launch attack, the accuracy will drop. Using MUD-PQFed can perfectly eliminate the influence of malicious clients.</p>

The horizontal axis represents the degree per parameter changed, and the vertical axis represents the number of parameters tampered.
It can be seen that with the increase in parameter degree change or/and the number of parameters changed, the TPR also increases whenever the attacker wants to successfully and efficiently perform the model corruption attack.
The TPR is low due to limited number of tampered parameters or/and small degree change per parameter, as a result of the malicious tampered parameters can be concealed by the rest of values submitted from benign clients.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main advantage of MUD-PQFed is to accurately identify malicious clients, and then the incentive mechanism can be incorporated to punish malicious clients in the FL. Note that FL relies on multiple local clients to jointly train the global model, the quality of client (i.e., data quality) will severely affect the global model utility. Nonetheless, clients, especially those high quality clients, are loathed to participate and share their own updates without adequate compensation and rewards.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, clients participating in FL may have privacy concerns because of privacy inference attacks even if the local data is not accessed by the server and other clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S7.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, there will be system cost incurred to the client during participation in the FL. More specifically, it will inevitably consume the computational and communicational resources of the client.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Incentives can be mainly divided into positive incentives  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> and reverse penalties  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. Positive incentives motivate clients by rewarding them, while negative incentives avoid malicious behavior by punishing individuals. So we can use the reverse incentive mechanism to punish the identified malicious clients, while rewarding the normal clients with the positive incentive mechanism
If it only needs to eliminate the influence of malicious client submitted values on the final aggregation result, coarse-grained detection can be applied by simply grouping the clients participating in the aggregation and then check whether their aggregated values in a normal range per group.
Then the submitted parameters of the entire group is removed before aggregation.</p>

<div id="S7.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A positive incentive mechanism can attract high-quality clients to actively participate. In addition, the MUD-PQFed can accurately identify malicious clients under the condition of ciphertext that mitigates potential privacy leakages posed in plaintext FL setting. Furthermore, the MUD-PQFed is designed for quantized FL, which can greatly reduce the communication overhead of the clients, which allows those with limited bandwidth to contribute.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Though the lightweight cryptographic (in particular, the secret sharing enabled MPC) based privacy-preserving FL can efficiently prevent privacy leakage, the security threats in this setting are not well elucidated. This work is the first study showing the trivialness of conducting model corruption attacks against the communication-efficient quantized FL. We then devise the MUD-PQFed to accurately detect malicious clients to eliminate such attacks. Extensive experiments have validated the efficacy and effectiveness of our MUD-PQFed.</p>
