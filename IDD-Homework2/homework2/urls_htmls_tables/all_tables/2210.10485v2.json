            "Despite their successes, we find that the previous AML approaches (Figure 1) are only effective in achieving adversarial robustness from seen domain tasks (e.g., CIFAR-FS, Mini-ImageNet), while showing poor transferable robustness to unseen domains (e.g., Tiered-ImageNet, CUB, Flower, Cars) as shown in Table 1. While the ultimate goal of meta-learning is obtaining transferable performance across various domain (Guo et al., 2020; Oh et al., 2022), which is a common occurrence in real-world, to the best of our knowledge, no research has yet targeted generalizable adversarial robustness in few-shot classification on unseen domains, leaving the problem largely unexplored.",
            "Given that our main goal is to attain transferable robustness on tasks from unseen domains, we mainly validate our method on unseen domain few-shot classification tasks. We meta-train MAVRL on CIFAR-FS (or Mini-ImageNet) and meta-test it on other benchmark datasets from different domains such as Mini-ImageNet (or CIFAR-FS), Tiered-ImageNet, CUB, Flower, and Cars. As shown in Table 1, MAVRL achieves impressive transferable robustness on unseen domain tasks, while previous AML methods easily break down to adversarial attacks from the unseen domains. In particular, MAVRL outperforms the baselines by more than 10% in robust accuracy even though the distribution of the unseen domains (i.e., CUB, Flower, and Cars) which are different from the distribution of the meta-trained dataset.",
            "To verify whether the model can capture distinctive visual features in any unseen domain, we visualize the representation space of an unseen domain, CIFAR-10, using t-SNE (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008). Figure 3 shows that MAVRL is able to obtain a well-separated feature space for adversarial examples in this novel domain. In contrast, AQ presents a substantially overlapped feature space across adversarial instances belonging to different classes, indicated by red dots scattered on diverse clusters. This observation suggests that the superior adversarial robustness of MAVRL in unseen domains in Table 1 mainly stems from its ability to extract robust visual features from the input of any domain through the proposed multi-view meta-adversarial representation learning."

            "Our motivation is derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) that learns visual representation wherein augmented images coexist within the same latent space, which is label-free and effective in yielding transferable representation. One of the straightforward adaptations of SSL and AML is applying SSL-based meta-learning (Liu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023) on the AML. However, simple employment of SSL could not contribute to the transferable adversarial robustness contrary to the success in achieving transferable clean performance in Table 3. Another trivial combination to obtain transferable robustness is adopting the self-supervised adversarial attack (Kim et al., 2020) on the query set 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} (Figure 1 (b)) as follows:",

The remaining instances in the batch {x}𝑥\\{x\\} are then defined as {xneg}subscript𝑥neg\\{x_{\\texttt{neg}}\\}. z,zpos𝑧subscript𝑧posz,z_{\\texttt{pos}}, and {zneg}subscript𝑧neg\\{z_{\\texttt{neg}}\\} are latent vectors obtained from the feature encoder fθ​(⋅)subscript𝑓𝜃⋅f_{\\theta}(\\cdot). The sim​(⋅,⋅)sim⋅⋅\\text{sim}(\\cdot,\\cdot) and T𝑇T are cosine similarity function and a temperature term, respectively. However, the trivial combination of self-supervised adversarial attack to AML could not ensure the transferable adversarial robustness of meta-learners, as shown in Table 3. We attribute the failure of simple modification to the well-known problem of the contrastive objective in a small batch, representational collapse (Chen & He, 2021; Zbontar et al., 2021) of adversarial examples: models trivially produce similar or even identical representations for different adversarial examples, especially when using small batch sizes in self-supervised adversarial attack.

This hinders meta-learners from achieving both generalized adversarial robustness and clean performance in unseen domains.",
            "Our method provides a novel attack scheme that maximizes the representational discrepancy across the views, along with a consistency-based robust representation learning scheme, which is not a mere combination of adversarial learning, SSL, and meta-learning. A naïve combination of these strategies does not yield the same level of transferable adversarial robustness, as evidenced in Table 3. Combining meta-learning and adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018) fails to provide transferable performance in both clean and robust settings, as shown in previous AML approaches. While combining self-supervised learning-based meta-learning (Liu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023) with class-wise adversarial training grants transferable clean performance, it fails to obtain adversarial robustness. Additionally, employing self-supervised adversarial training (Kim et al., 2020) within meta-learning forces a compromise on clean performance for transferable adversarial robustness. Contrarily, our bootstrapped multi-view representation learning successfully delivers exceptional clean and adversarial robustness in unseen domains."

This leads SSL to be able to attain strong structural recognition (Ericsson et al., 2021) based on large-scale data. However, since few-shot learning operates with a limited number of examples, a simple combination of SSL and AML approaches could not achieve adversarially robust representations for unseen domains due to adversarial representational collapse (Figure 1, Table 6).",

AT uses project gradient descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) to maximize loss in inner-maximization loops while minimizing overall loss on adversarial samples. TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019) have theoretically shown that KLD loss enhances robustness by enforcing consistency in predictive distribution between clean and adversarial examples. Transfer learning (Shafahi et al., 2019) can also be used to transfer learned robust representations to new domains with few data. One of the most similar adversarial learning methods to ours is RoCL (Kim et al., 2020), which proposes to adversarially train a robust neural network without labeled data, by instance-wise adversarial attack. However, we found that the simple application of instance-wise attacks on few-shot learning is not effective (Table 6).",
            "As discussed in Section 3.3, a naive combination of self-supervised learning (SSL) and adversarial meta-learning (AML) fails to achieve transferable robust representation learning. We investigate two cases of this naÏve combination. First, we incorporate task-agnostic instance-wise attacks for adversarial training with a single encoder during the outer optimization phase. We generate adversarial examples following previous works (Kim et al., 2020) using a single encoder (parameters θτsuperscript𝜃𝜏\\theta^{\\tau}), as shown in Eq. 11. We then minimize the adversarial loss in the outer optimization, as indicated in Eq. 12 [1], i.e., ℒablsubscriptℒabl\\mathcal{L}_{\\texttt{abl}}[1]. However, as demonstrated in Table 6, without multi-view encoders, the model fails to generate strong adversarial examples, resulting in insufficient robustness even within the seen domain. Additionally, when we incorporate representation learning loss in the outer optimization using Eq. 12 [2], i.e., ℒablsubscriptℒabl\\mathcal{L}_{\\texttt{abl}}[2]. the model exhibits slightly improved transferable robustness but still performs poorly. The difference is illustrated as blue text in Eq. 11,  12. In conclusion, a simple combination of self-supervised learning and adversarial meta-learning, as presented in Algorithm 3, leads to representation collapse due to the small batch size, rendering the task-agnostic adversarial attack ineffective in leveraging transferable robustness in unseen domains.",

Each component significantly contributes to improving robustness in both seen and unseen domains. Notably, when we incorporate bootstrapping multi-view encoders, the model achieves substantially enhanced robustness in the unseen domains. These results highlight the crucial role of each of our novel components in achieving robustness in unseen domains."

Furthermore, MAVRL exhibits remarkable robustness with just 3 steps of multi-view latent attacks compared to AQ (Goldblum et al., 2020), which is trained with PGD-7 attacks (i.e., class-wise attack). To emphasize the superiority of multi-view latent attacks over class-wise attacks at the representation level, we calculate feature similarity between clean and adversarial examples using CKA (Kornblith et al., 2019). Notably, the latent attack yielded a lower CKA value than the class-wise attack (as seen in Figure 4), which means that latent attacks produce perturbations that deviate more significantly from the original clean images, making them more challenging. Through these remarkable results, we underscore that our proposed multi-view latent attack served as a stronger attack that promotes the robust transferability of the model to unseen domains, even with fewer gradient steps of attacks and limited data.",

In particular, cosine distance loss enforces the consistency between two maximally dissimilar views of adversaries, leading meta-learners to achieve transferable robustness. We further examine the effectiveness of cosine distance loss by altering it to other consistency loss including contrastive loss and KLD loss. As shown in Table 9, the cosine similarity term was the most effective objective for aligning the multi-view latent spaces, demonstrating the highest unseen domain robustness on average. This is because cosine distance loss explicitly aligns the two latent vectors obtained from multi-view latent attacks while others implicitly enforce the consistency to differently generated adversarial representations."
