            "Accuracy improvement per communication cost in training. Figs. 5 (a) and 5 (b) show the accuracy as a function of the cumulative communication cost\nfor MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, respectively, with {Ip,Io}={20000,20000}superscript𝐼psuperscript𝐼o2000020000\\{I^{\\mathrm{p}},I^{\\mathrm{o}}\\}=\\{20000,20000\\} and non-IID datasets.\nThe cumulative communication cost of DS-FL includes an initial cost to distribute the unlabeled data to the clients in addition to the per round cost, while that of other baselines did not include the initial cost.\nThe initial cost is described as ComU@I in Table III.\nIn both the FL and DS-FL, as the training processes progress, i.e., the cumulative communication costs to share models or logits increase, and the accuracy improves.\nDS-FL performance is evaluated using the global model, which is trained on the server as described in Section 2.3.2.\nMeanwhile, the FD accuracy remains approximately 20%percent2020\\%, which is almost similar to that of a single client.\nIn both tasks: MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, the proposed DS-FL outperforms the FL (benchmark 1) in terms of cumulative communication cost while achieving comparable accuracy.\nAs shown in Table I, the results could be due to the communication cost per round of the DS-FL that is lower than that of FL.\nIf the aggregation methods in DS-FL are compared, the proposed ERA obtains almost the same accuracy as that of the SA baseline, while the cumulative communication cost to the convergence of ERA is smaller than that of SA due to the acceleration effect of ERA.\nBased on these results, we can conclude that the DS-FL with the proposed ERA reduces the communication costs substantially while achieving similar performance to the FL benchmark, i.e., ERA accelerates the convergence speed.",
            "Moreover, these results are also verified in Table III.\nThe table lists the cumulative communication costs required to achieve a test classification accuracy of x%percent𝑥x\\%, and the highest testing accuracy among the training process, referred to as ComU@x%percent𝑥x\\%, and Top-Accuracy, respectively.\nIn Table III, the DS-FL with ERA achieves lower ComU@x%percent𝑥x\\% than that using DS-FL with SA and FL for all cases.\nFor example, regarding Fashion-MNIST, DS-FL with ERA achieves 99.0% lower ComU65%percent6565\\% and 99.4% lower ComU@75%percent7575\\% than FL. Moreover,\nregarding Reuters, DS-FL with ERA achieves 99.4% lower ComU@65%percent6565\\% and higher Top-Accuracy than FL.",
            "Test accuracy comparison. Table III lists the highest accuracy for all the training rounds denoted as Top-Accuracy.\nThe table indicates that the DS-FL with ERA achieves similar or superior Top-Accuracy compared to that of FL and DS-FL with SA.\nComparing DS-FL with ERA to the FL benchmark in the MNIST task, the Top-Accuracy of DS-FL with ERA reaches up to 98.5% when Io=40,000superscript𝐼o40000I^{\\mathrm{o}}=40{,}000, which is only 0.2% lower than that of FL.\nIn the Fashion-MNIST and Reuters tasks, the Top-Accuracy of the DS-FL with ERA is higher than that of FL for all cases.\nIn the IMDb task, the Top-Accuracy of the DS-FL with ERA is 4.7% lower than that of FL, whereas it is 18.6% higher than that of FD.\nHence, we can again conclude that DS-FL with ERA achieves similar test performance to the FL benchmark while drastically reducing the communication costs.\nComparing the Top-Accuracy of the proposed ERA and SA baseline, SA achieves higher Top-Accuracy relative to ERA for the MNIST task even though the difference becomes smaller as the number of samples in the unlabeled open dataset increases.\nMeanwhile, regarding the Fashion-MNIST task, the proposed ERA achieves higher Top-Accuracy than SA, where the difference ranges from 4.0% to 13.7%.\nHence, recall that Fashion-MNIST is a more complicated task than MNIST [34].\nIn the IMDb and Reuters tasks, the proposed ERA achieves higher accuracy than SA.\nThese results provide insight into the importance of reducing the entropy global logits, particularly in more complicated tasks, to enhance the DS-FL model performance."
