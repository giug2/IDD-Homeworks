            "In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-IoT system.\nSpecifically, we first provide simulation results for the optimal meta-IoT structure obtained by Algorithm 1.\nThen, we provide the experimental results for the multi-antenna wireless transceiver to validate its capability of sensing meta-IoT sensor arrays at different heights.\nFollowing that, we provide the experimental results for the prototype system to detect and locate humidity and temperature anomalies, in the cases of different measuring distances, anomaly scales, noise levels, and depths of the neural network.\nThe detailed parameters of the system are summarized in Table I.",
            "Then, the evaluation of the optimal meta-IoT structure obtained by Algorithm 1 is provided.\nSpecifically, when solving Algorithm 1, the same system parameters used in the experimental evaluation in Table I are adopted.\nBesides, the additional parameters in the simulation can be explained as follows.\nThe thickness of the wall Dw=30subscript𝐷w30D_{\\mathrm{w}}=30 mm, and the relative index of refraction of the wall is nw=4.2subscript𝑛w4.2n_{\\mathrm{w}}=4.2 based on [47].\nMoreover, we consider the performance of meta-IoT sensors in three environmental condition cases, which are the normal case (temperature 20∘superscript2020^{\\circ}C, humidity 55%percent5555\\%), temperature anomaly case (temperature 50∘superscript5050^{\\circ}C, humidity 55%percent5555\\%), and humidity anomaly case (temperature 20∘superscript2020^{\\circ}C, humidity 75%percent7575\\%).\nBased on [46, 45], the conductivities of the temperature sensitive material in normal and anomaly cases are 0.320.320.32 and 0.970.970.97 [S/m], and those of the humidity sensitive material are 0.110.110.11 and 0.670.670.67 [S/m], respectively.\nFurthermore, the available meta-IoT structure set is 𝒟A={𝒅|di∈[0.5,2]\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{A}}=\\{\\bm{d}|d_{i}\\!\\in\\![0.5,2], di∈ℝ,i=1,2}d_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R},i\\!=\\!1,2\\}, which ensures the resonant absorption peaks of the two SRRs within [3.5,4]3.54[3.5,4] GHz, and the sampled meta-IoT structure set is 𝒟^A={𝒅|di∈{0.5,1,1.5,2},i=1,2}subscript^𝒟Aconditional-set𝒅formulae-sequencesubscript𝑑𝑖0.511.52𝑖12\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}_{\\mathrm{A}}=\\{\\bm{d}|d_{i}\\!\\in\\!\\{0.5,1,1.5,2\\},i\\!=\\!1,2\\}.\nGiven the above simulation setting, the optimal meta-IoT structure obtained by Algorithm 1 is 𝒅∗=(1.126,1.761)superscript𝒅1.1261.761\\bm{d}^{*}=(1.126,1.761) mm."
