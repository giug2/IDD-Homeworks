            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates."

The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",

First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",

We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18]."

FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",

First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",

We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",

In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",

On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

            "where Ω={t1,t2,⋯,tk}Ωsubscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2⋯subscript𝑡𝑘\\Omega=\\{t_{1},t_{2},\\cdots,t_{k}\\} is the set of k𝑘k check points. FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

            "where Ω={t1,t2,⋯,tk}Ωsubscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2⋯subscript𝑡𝑘\\Omega=\\{t_{1},t_{2},\\cdots,t_{k}\\} is the set of k𝑘k check points. FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

            "where Ω={t1,t2,⋯,tk}Ωsubscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2⋯subscript𝑡𝑘\\Omega=\\{t_{1},t_{2},\\cdots,t_{k}\\} is the set of k𝑘k check points. FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

            "where Ω={t1,t2,⋯,tk}Ωsubscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2⋯subscript𝑡𝑘\\Omega=\\{t_{1},t_{2},\\cdots,t_{k}\\} is the set of k𝑘k check points. FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input."

            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset."

First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data."

            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious."

FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."

FLForensics incurs space overhead for the server due to storing global models and clients’ model updates in the check points. The space overhead is linear to the model size, number of check points, and the number of clients selected to participate in each training round. This storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server. In Section 8, we discuss the potential privacy concerns of storing checkpoints.",
            "Datasets: \nWe use five benchmark datasets in our experiments, comprising four image datasets and one text dataset. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.",
            "FL training settings:  Following prior work [9, 4], we assume 100 clients in total. A unique characteristic of FL is that the local training data are not identically distributed (non-iid) across clients. We use the method in [4] to simulate non-iid settings, and the degree of non-iid is set to 0.5 for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST, and ImageNet-Fruits. The details of simulating non-iid can be found in Appendix A.6. For the Sentiment140 dataset, we divide the users into 100 groups uniformly at random. Each group is considered as a client, whose local training data is the union of the training tweets of the users in the group. Users’ tweets are non-iid, so the clients’ local training data are also non-iid. Therefore, we do not need to simulate the non-iid setting for this dataset. We train a ResNet-20 [30] classifier for CIFAR-10, a CNN classifier for Fashion-MNIST and MNIST (the architecture is shown in Table 15 in Appendix), a LSTM [31] classifier for Sentiment140, and a ResNet-50 [30] classifier for ImageNet-Fruits dataset.",
            "The default parameter settings (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, global rounds, and local training epochs) are shown in Table 16 in Appendix. By default, the server selects all clients in each training round and uses the average aggregation rule FedAvg [1] to aggregate the clients’ model updates. However, we will explore the impact of the fraction of selected clients in a training round and aggregation rule on FLForensics.",
            "Training-phase defenses are insufficient:  Training-phase defenses use robust FL methods or malicious-client detection methods to prevent malicious clients from poisoning a global model during training. Table 18 in Appendix shows that robust FL methods–such as Trim [7], Median [7], FLTrust [9], and FLAME [8]–are insufficient. In particular, ASRs of the considered poisoning attacks are still high in many cases. Table 2 shows that FLDetector, a malicious-client detection method, cannot accurately detect malicious clients during training in many cases. These training-phase defenses are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks because the clients’ training data are non-iid, making it hard to accurately distinguish between malicious clients’ and benign clients’ model updates.",
            "FLForensics is effective:  Table 3 shows the results of FLForensics and compared poison-forensics methods under different attacks and datasets.\nWe observe that FLForensics can accurately identify malicious clients, achieving a DACC of 1 or nearly 1 in all experiments. The FPR of FLForensics is 0 or close to 0 in most cases, with four exceptions (Sentiment140 dataset under Scaling attack, Sentiment140 dataset under Edge attack, CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, and ImageNet-Fruits dataset under Edge attack), for which FPR is around 3%, i.e., one to three benign clients are misclassified as malicious. Similarly, FNR is also 0 or close to 0, with only two exceptions.",
            "FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods: \nTable 3 also shows that our FLForensics outperforms the compared poison-forensics methods. First, FLForensics outperforms FLForensics-A, particularly evident in FLForensics’s significantly lower FPR compared to FLForensics-A. For instance, FLForensics exhibits a FPR of 0 under all attacks on CIFAR-10, while FLForensics-A’s FPR consistently exceeds 10%, indicating that at least 8 benign clients are incorrectly classified as malicious clients by FLForensics-A. This result demonstrates that using only the target input x𝑥{x} is unable to distinguish between malicious and Category I benign clients. Second, FLForensics outperforms PF and FLForensics-G because they were not designed for FL. In our comparison, we give advantages to FLForensics-G and PF by assuming that they have access to the local training data. We also conduct experiments where they use clients’ model updates sent to the server. Table 17 in Appendix shows the results. We can observe that FLForensics-G performs worse, while PF achieves similar performance to using the local training data.",
            "Impact of number of check points and storage overhead:  Table 4 shows the impact of the number of check points on FLForensics. We observe a trade-off between storage overhead and poison-forensics performance. In particular, when a server saves more check points, which incurs more storage overhead, the server can more accurately detect the malicious clients. We also note that the storage overhead is acceptable for a powerful server to achieve good poison-forensics performance.\nTable 5 shows the storage overhead for different datasets in our default settings.\nFor instance, saving 150 check points for CIFAR-10 requires 15.22GB storage, which is acceptable for a powerful server like a data center.",
            "Impact of fraction of malicious clients: Table 6 shows the impact of fraction of malicious clients on FLForensics. We observe that FLForensics works well when a large fraction of clients are malicious. For instance, only 5% of malicious clients are identified as benign even if 40% of clients are malicious. Moreover, all benign clients are correctly detected as benign (i.e., FPR=0) when the fraction of malicious clients varies from 10% to 40%. We note that when the fraction of malicious clients is small, the attacks are not effective [4], and thus we consider at least 10% of malicious clients.",
            "Impact of degree of non-iid:  Based on the results in Table 8, FLForensics works well across different degrees of non-iid. In particular, FLForensics achieves 0 FPR and at most 15% FNR across different settings of degree of non-iid. Note that 0.1 degree of non-iid represents the iid setting. FLForensics works well for non-iid because it is explicitly designed to take non-iid into consideration.",
            "Impact of aggregation rules:  Based on Table 8, FLForensics can accurately trace back the malicious clients when the server uses different Byzantine-robust aggregation rules during training. We note that these Byzantine-robust aggregation rules are not effective at defending against the poisoning attacks in our experimental settings, as shown in Table 18 in Appendix.\nOur results show that FLForensics is complementary with training-phase defenses and can be used together with them.\nIn Table 8, FLForensics achieves slightly higher FPR when FLAME is used as the aggregation rule. This is because Scaling attack is less effective for FLAME and FLForensics incorrectly identifies some Category I benign clients as malicious.",
            "Impact of fraction of selected clients: Based on Table 10, FLForensics works well even if the server selects a small fraction of clients in each training round. The reason is that once a malicious client appears in multiple check-point training rounds, FLForensics can accumulate its influences to distinguish it with benign clients. Note that in this experiment, we save all training rounds as check points so a malicious client appears in multiple of them.",
            "Impact of scaling factor γ𝛾\\gamma:  Based on the results in Table 10, we observe that FLForensics works well for a wide range of scaling factors used by the Scaling attack. The reason is that once the Scaling attack is effective, FLForensics can identify the malicious clients. Previous work [16] shows that the higher the scaling factor, the more effective the attack, but it also makes the attack more susceptible to detection. We can observe that our FLForensics can detect all the malicious clients even when the scaling factor is close to 1. In such cases, methods (e.g., FLDetector) that rely on the magnitudes of clients’ model updates to detect malicious clients often fail.",
            "Recovering from attacks after FLForensics:  After detecting malicious clients, a server can re-train a global model using the remaining clients to recover from attacks. We pick the case in Table 3, for which FLForensics has the largest FNR, to show recovery results. On CIFAR-10 dataset under Edge attack, the original global model has testing accuracy 81.9% and ASR 17.4%; and after detecting malicious clients and re-training a global model, these numbers change to 82.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Note that the server can also re-train a global model with small communication/computation cost for the clients using FedRecover [18].",
            "Attack frequency: \nOne adaptive attack is that each malicious client performs attacks only in some certain selected training rounds, violating the poisoning attack definition in Definition 1. In particular, when a malicious client does not perform attack in a training round, it calculates its model update based on the clean local training data. Table 11a shows the results of FLForensics when the malicious clients perform the Scaling attack in every e𝑒e training rounds, where e𝑒e ranges from 1 to 10.\nWe find that when the malicious clients perform attack every 10 or more rounds, FLForensics cannot accurately detect the malicious clients. This is because the attacks are ineffective, i.e., ASRs are less than 12%. In other words, FLForensics can accurately detect malicious clients for the adaptive attack once it is effective, i.e., attack frequently and achieve high ASRs.",
            "Attack probability: \nOther than performing attacks periodically in every e𝑒e training rounds, an attacker can also choose to perform attack in each training round with a certain probability. Such attack may be more stealthy and harder to trace back. Table 11b shows the results when a malicious client launches the Scaling attack with a probability p𝑝p in each training round, where p𝑝p ranges from 0.2 to 1.0.\nWe observe that ASR decreases as p𝑝p decreases. FLForensics accurately detects malicious clients when p≥0.5𝑝0.5p\\geq 0.5, with a FPR not exceeding 1.25%. When p=0.2𝑝0.2p=0.2, the attack has an ASR of 20%. Since the attack is less effective in this scenario, FLForensics has a higher FNR at detecting malicious clients. However, FLForensics still achieves a small FPR, with at most one benign client misclassified as malicious.",
            "Trigger location: \nFollowing [16], we place the trigger at the upper right corner of an image by default. Table 11c illustrates the performance of FLForensics when the Scaling attack places the trigger at different locations, where UR, LR, UL, and LL represent the trigger is at the upper right corner, lower right corner, upper left corner, and lower left corner of an image, respectively. Note that the trigger in these experiments is the same as that in [16].\nWe also evaluate adding the trigger at a random location of each image in each training round, which corresponds to the ‘Random’ row. The results show that when the trigger’s location is fixed, the attack is generally more effective, with only the UL trigger location having a lower ASR, and FLForensics can correctly identify malicious clients in such scenarios. When the attacker introduces the trigger at random locations, the attack becomes less effective, and thus FLForensics misses some malicious clients (FNR is around 30%). Our results show that FLForensics performs well across various trigger locations that achieve high ASRs. We note that previous work [34] showed that trigger location including random location does not have much impact on an attack’s ASR. We have a different observation in our experiments. This is because the previous work was for centralized learning, while our results are for FL.",
            "Trigger value: \nTo investigate the performance of FLForensics under different trigger values, we vary the pixel value of the trigger, where the trigger shape is from Bagdasaryan et al. [16]. Specifically, we select three different RGB values for each pixel of the trigger, i.e., (255, 255, 255), (204, 204, 204), and (0, 0, 0). Additionally, we use a random trigger, each pixel of which has random RGB values. Table 11e shows these triggers and the corresponding performance of FLForensics. Our results indicate that once the attack is effective, FLForensics can accurately trace back malicious clients. FLForensics misses all the malicious clients when the trigger value is (0, 0, 0). This is because this trigger value is ineffective at all, i.e., ASR=0.",
            "Trigger size: \nTable 11d shows the results of FLForensics when the Scaling attack uses different trigger sizes, where the trigger is a white square located at the upper right corner. We observe that as the trigger size increases, ASR also increases. When the trigger size is 2×\\times2, the attack has almost no effect, leading to inaccurate detection of malicious clients for FLForensics. However, when the trigger size is greater than or equal to 3×\\times3, FLForensics can correctly identify all malicious clients, even with an ASR of only 14.2%. These results show that once the trigger size is large enough to make the attack somewhat effective, our FLForensics performs well.",
            "Using true input as non-target input:  In our experiments, we use a random input (e.g., a random image) as a non-target input in FLForensics. When a true input with the target label is available, the server can also use it as the non-target input. Table 12 compares the results when FLForensics uses a random input or true input as the non-target input on the five datasets and three attacks.\nWe find that random inputs and true inputs achieve comparable results in most cases, except several cases, for which true inputs achieve slightly lower FPRs. These results indicate that if a true input with the target label from the learning task’s data distribution is available, the server can use it as the non-target input.",
            "Extending FLForensics to centralized learning:  Our FLForensics can also be extended to centralized learning. In particular, we treat a training example as a “client”; wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} in Equation 5 and 6 is the model in the t𝑡tth mini-batch when training a model; and gt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑔𝑡𝑖g_{t}^{(i)} is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} for the i𝑖ith training example. We find that when the training dataset is unbalanced (i.e., like non-iid in FL) and the target label is a class that has more training examples, FLForensics substantially outperforms existing poison-forensics methods for centralized learning. For instance, Table 14 shows the results for different methods at tracing back the poisoned training examples, where FLForensics-True means using a true input as the non-target input. The dataset is sampled from CIFAR-10, where Figure 5 in Appendix shows the distribution of training examples among the classes in our experiments. We performed a targeted poisoning attack to the dataset: the target label is 1; and we inject the trigger used in our FL experiments into 10% of the training inputs."
