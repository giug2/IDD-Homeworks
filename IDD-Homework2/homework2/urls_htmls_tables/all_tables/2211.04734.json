            "However, the large labeled datasets needed to train generative adversarial models are not always available in clinical practice because medical images require experts to acquire and label, and the number of patients with specific medical conditions may not be sufficient to create large datasets. This paper proposes a new adversarial learning method that does not require generating large training datasets to solve the problem of domain shift and sparse labels that exist in federated transfer learning, greatly reducing the cost of training and improving the accuracy of the FTL model in medical diagnosis, providing an implementable solution for wearable devices to monitor people’s healthcare.",
            "The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images that were anti-aliased and normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box. We give 10 source clients 15000 samples for model training and 1000 samples to the target client for testing. The image features are extracted using the Conv2d algorithm. The experimental results are shown in Table 1. Easier MNIST datasets made the performance better than the current state-of-the-art methods.",
            "We also set up a set of ablation experiments as a way to determine the impact of the new performance on the AFTL algorithm as shown in Table 2. and Table 3. When we remove the client discriminator on the central server, the accuracy of the test results is generally lower than that with the discriminator, indicating that the effect of our proposed client discriminator is significant as shown in Figure 6. Meanwhile, in the method without the discriminator, the accuracy of the test results increases with the increase of the sample size, while with the discriminator included, the accuracy of the test results is not significantly affected by the sample size, indicating that the proposed method is robust to the sample size, further demonstrating that the method can guarantee the training effect without the need to generate new sample data."
