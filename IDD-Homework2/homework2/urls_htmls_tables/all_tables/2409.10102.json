            "Defination of six key dimensions of trustworthiness in the RAG context : As shown in Figure  1 , we define trustworthiness across six dimensions: (1) Factuality: Ensuring the accuracy and truthfulness of generated information by verifying it against reliable sources. (2) Robustness: Ensuring the systems reliability against errors, adversarial attacks, and other external threats. (3) Fairness: Minimizing biases in retrieval and generation stages to ensure fair outcomes. (4) Transparency: Making RAG system processes and decisions clear and understandable to users, fostering trust and accountability. (5) Accountability: Implementing mechanisms to ensure the systems actions and outputs are responsible and traceable. (6) Privacy: Protecting personal data and user privacy throughout retrieval and generation processes."

            "As illustrated in Figure  2 , we identify six essential dimensions of trustworthiness in a RAG system:  Robustness ,  Fairness ,  Factuality ,  Privacy ,  Transparency , and  Accountability . For each of these dimensions, we will explore the following aspects: a general definition applicable to LLMs, a specific definition within the RAG context, and a thorough literature review. To provide a clearer categorization and summary of the relevant research, we first present a timeline of these studies in Figure  3  to identify trends in the field. Then, in Table   I , we categorize each study based on three criteria: dimension of trustworthiness, method type, and object. The following sections will delve into each dimension of trustworthiness in greater detail."

            "Based on the above results, we ranked the ten models across six dimensions of trustworthiness, as illustrated in Fig.  4 . We can observe that, overall, GPT-4o and GPT-3.5-turbo exhibit higher comprehensive trustworthiness, with the exception of the privacy dimension. This underscores the ongoing challenge of privacy protection. Other open-source models tend to excel in specific areas. For instance: The Llama2-chat series models are particularly strong in privacy protection. The Baichuan2-chat series models demonstrate high transparency. The GLM-chat series models excel in accountability. This analysis reveals that achieving comprehensive trustworthiness is a complex endeavor that requires more effort. Key areas for improvement include the development of standardized benchmarks, enhancement of training data, and more rigorous evaluation methods. These steps are essential to ensure that models can perform well across all dimensions of trustworthiness."
