<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">We carefully evaluate a number of algorithms for learning in a federated environment, and test their utility for a variety of image classification tasks. We consider many issues that have not been adequately considered before: whether learning over data sets that do not have diverse sets of images affects the results; whether to use a pre-trained feature extraction “backbone”; how to evaluate learner performance (we argue that classification accuracy is not enough), among others. Overall, across a wide variety of settings, we find that vertically decomposing a neural network seems to give the best results, and outperforms more standard reconciliation-used methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There has been a recent influx of work aimed at developing and evaluating new algorithms for Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, particularly for image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
Most papers are primarily concerned with the development of innovative algorithms, and less concerned with the design of appropriate benchmarks and especially, appropriate baselines to test against.
This paper, in contrast, is concerned with benchmarking: <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Which existing methods for FL work best, and under what conditions do they work, or not work?</span>
As such, our primary contribution is a set of carefully-designed experiments, rather than the introduction of a new FL algorithm.
Our benchmarks are designed to address the following concerns regarding the design of FL benchmarks and baselines.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">(1) <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Learning algorithms are typically evaluated on a few diverse data sets, rather than a large variety of more focused data sets.</span> The most common benchmark for evaluating federated image classification is CIFAR-100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
This dataset includes whales, chairs, dinosaurs, and so on.
This is a very diverse set of classes, and we are concerned that few FL tasks will involve differentiating dinosaurs from rabbits.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For example, imagine that the members of a bird watching club taking pictures with their smartphones; club members label the pictures with the bird species, and FL is used to build a classifier.
Or, a set of companies who are typically competitors—and hence cannot exchange data—want to work together to classify pictures of industrial drill bits based on whether they are going to fail.
Both of these deployments involve narrow domains, and the classification problems involve fine-grained differentiation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> among members of a narrow category.
True, not all applications of FL will be narrow, but they are likely to be far narrower than classifying whales versus chairs.
We argue that, while evaluating on a broad data set—such as CIFAR-100—is useful, it is also necessary to evaluate FL algorithms on a variety of more narrow data sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">(2) <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Most evaluations focus on final accuracy or the number of communication rounds required for convergence.</span>
FL algorithms are often evaluated by reporting final accuracies (after convergence), or by plotting test accuracy as a function of the number of epochs, or the number of communication rounds.
However, final accuracy, at least in isolation, is not really a useful metric. After all, the simplest “FL” algorithm is classical, data parallel learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. That is, run distributed gradient descent; compute gradients locally over mini-batches in a fully synchronous way, then do an all-reduce. As this is functionally equivalent to centralized learning, it is invariant to data distribution, and is likely to be the most accurate method in terms of final accuracy. However, it is inefficient in a federated environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Likewise, considering accuracy as a function of communication rounds ignores the computation or communication cost of each round. Communication and computation costs can vary across methods, and are typically far more important than the number of rounds. A method that can quickly achieve high accuracy with a relatively large number of very inexpensive communication rounds—where a small fraction of the model is communicated at each round—is probably preferred to one that uses few rounds, but must transmit a huge amount of data. Similarly, for computation, given similar accuracies, an algorithm that performs one forward and one backward gradient descent pass is preferred over one that performs two additional forward passes, as extra overhead<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, even though both operate in the same number of communication rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">(3) <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Pre-trained feature extractors need to be a standard baseline.</span>
Training the feature-extraction backbone that is used in most deep image processing networks—that is, the series of convolutional and pooling layers and without the final classification layer—is not easy. It is difficult to get the training process right, and training a good backbone requires a lot of computation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Researchers have recently suggested using pre-trained backbones, especially for few-shot training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In a pre-trained backbone, a pre-trained feature extractor such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> or vision transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is used without modification to embed an image in a high-dimensional space. Learning is then performed on the resulting vectors, and not on the original images. The goal is to leverage an existing, well-trained model on the new learning problem. Given the resource constraints in many FL scenarios, it is unclear why attempting to fully train such a backbone from scratch in a federated environment would be the first approach. Instead, we suggest simply taking a standard, pre-trained backbone (such as a ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, or a DenseNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, or both used together) and directly using that backbone as a feature extractor, without training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The benefit is that each training image only needs to be pushed through the backbone one time to obtain a compact set of features, and then that set can be used during training. As the backbone need not to be communicated or repeatedly used to process the input images, both CPU/GPU cycles and communication are saved during federated training. Furthermore, final accuracies might actually be better, as this approach sidesteps the difficulty of training the backbone.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(</span>4) <span id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Off-the-shelf performance is really what matters, but it is often neglected in research studies.</span>
In a centralized environment, it is feasible to train and re-train many times, as various parameters (learning rate, proximal weight, exact neural architecture, etc.) are tuned. In FL, this is much less feasible. Most FL scenarios imagine a resource-constrained environment (possibly involving edge devices), where one cannot ignore the cost of tuning. FL is typically happening on someone else’s hardware, and so running an algorithm many times during parameter tuning is likely to make participation in training far less palatable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Further, application-specific tuning may simply be impossible. A device may enter the federated training and then drop out shortly after, never to be seen again. One cannot access a missing device’s data to perform validation, and clearly, one cannot retrain over data that cannot be accessed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">As such, we argue that “off-the-shelf” performance is more important than in centralized learning. That is, it becomes important to settle on one set of universal parameters that tend to work in most deployments, such that the learning algorithm can be universally deployed without further tuning. At the very least, this is an important use case that should be covered in most experiments.</p>

While the above algorithms modify the local training process of FedAvg, FedAdam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> modifies the aggregation step. Once the averaged weights are computed via local gradient descent and their average is computed, it is used to compute a global gradient surrogate to be used in the Adam algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

However, we use the specific formulation specified in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, where these weights are normalizations of the local gradients.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">IST.</span> We consider the previous set of learning algorithms to be “reconciliation-used”; in that, they attempt to train a copy of the model at each site. In contrast, IST, or <em id="S3.SS1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">independent subnet training</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>
does not utilize averaging or some other method to try to reconcile versions of the model trained at the various site. Instead, IST decomposes the model and sends non-overlapping parts of the model to different sites. In one training round, all neurons (or activations) in a neural network are randomly partitioned to the active sites. A weight is only sent to a site if it connects two neurons that have been assigned to the site. Thus, each site is assigned only a very small subnetwork, which is trained locally for a number of gradient descent steps. At the end of local training, the updated weights are shuffled (with or without the aid of a central server) and the process is repeated. Since subnetworks are independent, there is no averaging or other form of reconciliation needed. There are many variants of this approach in the literature, including FjORD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, HeteroFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, LotteryFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, FedSelect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, FedRolex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, Federated Dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, PVT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, and the independent subnetwork training approach in the non-FL setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">All of the methods we tested (except for one baseline) utilize pre-trained backbones. That is, we take a pre-trained feature image classifiers: ResNet101 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and DenseNet121 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and remove the classification layers to produce two “backbones.” When processing an image, we simply concatenate the feature vectors produced by the two backbones to produce a 3072 dimensional vector. We also evaluate FedProx, but without a pre-trained backbone. This version of FedProx (called “FedFull”) uses a ResNet18 instead of a single-hidden layer MLP.</p>

The only processing we apply on these data sets, besides using the pre-trained feature extractors, is the standard cropping and resizing of image data.

For all algorithms except for IST, ISTProx, and FedFull, tuning led us to a single-hidden-layer, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with 1,000 hidden neurons sitting on top of the feature extractor. FedFull was trained with its “out of the box” configuration. For IST and ISTProx, we find scaling the hidden neurons based on the number of concurrent training sites made sense (3000 neurons for ten sites, 6000 for 20, 9000 for 30, 18000 for 60, and so on). This ensures that the client models are not too small.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Choosing an evaluation metric is among the most difficult aspects of evaluating FL methods, but does not seem to have received much attention in the literature. Most papers focus on final accuracy: <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">What is the accuracy that a FL method exhibits on a test set after training?</span> Unfortunately, final accuracy as a metric makes little sense in isolation from other considerations. After all, the method that likely gives the very best final accuracy is simple distributed mini-batch training, where each site computes gradients over a small subset of its local data; those gradients are summed and a central site updates the model. This is algorithmically equivalent to centralized training, but it is typically not tested, because it is generally assumed that the convergence would be too “slow,” for some implicit definition of “slow.” Thus, a more carefully-defined evaluation framework (beyond simple accuracy) is needed.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are a few clear results. First, except for FedAdam and FedFull, the methods generally have very similar final accuracy, with the two IST-based methods being slightly higher. Thus, one key finding is that for data without skewness across sites, <em id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">if one is only interested in final accuracy, it does not seem to matter much which method is used</em>, and this result holds across data sets. The two exceptions to this are FedAdam and FedFull. FedAdam does not reach the same final accuracy as the other methods, but it generally does quite a good job reaching high accuracy with relatively little communication. This corresponds to the fact that it tends to converge in relatively few communication rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedFull is a very interesting case. Note that it has poor final accuracy—only 3% in the case of the Cars data set. As a result, it is labeled as “FAIL” in every case, because it can never reach 90% of the peak accuracy observed for the other methods on a given data set. One might ask, <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Why is FedFull such a poor choice?</span> The answer is simple: <span id="S5.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">as we put a 100 teraFLOP/five terabyte “timeout” on the computation, FedFull timed out in every case.</span> That is, it <em id="S5.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">always</em> hit the 100 teraFLOP/five terabyte limit. Were FedFull allowed infinite computation and infinite communication, it is actually the preferred method, as the pre-trained backbones limit accuracy. For example, consider Figure <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4.2 Data Sets and Hyperparameters ‣ 4 Experimental Setup ‣ Federated Learning Over Images: Vertical Decompositions and Pre-Trained Backbones Are Difficult to Beat" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which plots accuracy as a function of FLOPs for both FedFull and FedProx on Cars. FedFull eventually reaches 90% accuracy, but it takes nearly <em id="S5.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">four orders of magnitude</em> more FLOPs to top out compared to FedProx. This FLOP usage gap is apparent in <a href="#S4.F1" title="In 4.2 Data Sets and Hyperparameters ‣ 4 Experimental Setup ‣ Federated Learning Over Images: Vertical Decompositions and Pre-Trained Backbones Are Difficult to Beat" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> where even the first communication round of FedFull requires more FLOPs than the amount required for the entire FedProx training. As a result, we would argue that full backpropagation is effectively unusable in resource-constrained FL.
Note, however, that our FedFull was trained using an initialization consisting of random weights. Perhaps a hybrid method makes sense, where one begins with FedProx (with a pre-trained backbone) and then once the MLP begins to reach peak accuracy, we allow backpropagation over the backbone to begin. This issue deserves further investigation. That said, given our maximum FLOP count and communication, FedFull is not competitive and in the interest of space, we will not consider it further.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The final observation we make is the general superiority of IST, over each of the six data sets. It is perhaps not surprising that IST is efficient in terms of communication and in terms of computation. Each site obtains only a fraction of the MLP that is being trained, saving communication <em id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">and</em> computation at each site. However, it is surprising that it is <em id="S5.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">also</em> generally the most accurate method, in terms of final accuracy (or close to it) in every case. We will examine this finding more fully, later in the paper.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Probably the single most interesting finding is that for a highly-skewed situation, there seems to be divergence in performance, depending upon the data set.
The two IST methods seem to perform best overall, with either IST or ISTProx being the superior option in terms of final accuracy, FLOPs, or communication for four of the six data sets. However, IST does relatively poorly on the venerable CFAR data set. CFAR is a somewhat strange benchmark, as the images are tiny (32 <math id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><times id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math> 32) and widely varied within the data set, and both IST variants have problems with this. Nevertheless, it is a good stress test. Note that in the two cases where IST does not do the best, it is either simple FedAvg or FedProx that is the best performer. One of the most surprising findings is that FedAvg dominates all other methods in all metrics (accuracy, FLOPs, communication) on Cars.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, across the two experiments (i.i.d. and skewed), we find that adding a proximal term to FedAvg (to obtain FedProx) seems to have little effect on accuracy, but <em id="S6.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">does</em> speedup convergence, both in terms of reducing communication and FLOPs. However, IST seems to be the best performer overall, allowing for significant reductions in communication and FLOPs. The addition of a proximal term <em id="S6.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">does not</em> seem to help IST much. The other methods tested all seem to under-perform.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">FedAvg and FedProx are shown to approximate the centralized gradient descent direction well early on, but the similarity drops after initial training. This makes sense, as initially, with a random initialization, learning is “easy” as the model is far from optimal. In the i.i.d. case FedAvg and FedProx perform well. But in the skewed case, after the initial training period, similarity to the centralized training direction drops. IST seems more well-behaved, with less variance. Especially considering
how well the methods approximate the direction of centralized training through twenty rounds on skewed data (the right column),
the IST-based methods seem to do better. This is especially pronounced for the Flwrs data set through the first 20 epochs, where IST averages a similarity of 0.035, compared to 0.01 for the averaging-based methods. Perhaps this is due to the high variance of the directions computed by FedAvg and FedProx—as estimators for the centrally-predicted direction—compared to IST. Examining why this is deserves further investigation in future work.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">All of our experiments thus far have focused on the simple case of 100 sites, where at each communication round, 10% of the sites are connected. We now ask: how do things change when the number of sites changes and/or the number of sites connected at each communication round changes? Keeping all of the other settings the same, we try 1000 sites, with either 2% or 6% of the sites connected at each communication round, and 100 sites, with either 10% of 30% of the sites connected at each round.

<div id="S7.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedAdam, IST, and ISTProx are generally helped a bit by increasing participation. But for the other methods, the results obtained by increasing participation rates are mixed, with a surprising number of red values in both Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 6.1 Setup ‣ 6 Effect of Data Skewness ‣ Federated Learning Over Images: Vertical Decompositions and Pre-Trained Backbones Are Difficult to Beat" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 6.1 Setup ‣ 6 Effect of Data Skewness ‣ Federated Learning Over Images: Vertical Decompositions and Pre-Trained Backbones Are Difficult to Beat" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, indicating a decrease in accuracy or communication efficiency via the addition of extra active sites. In addition, it seems that the increase from 2% participation to 6% participation is much more helpful than 10% to 30%.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The lack of clear benefit to increasing the rate of participation is not surprising in retrospect. Aside from FedFull, each of the methods was able to run to convergence in the allotted FLOP/communication budget. The central question becomes: can we run to convergence in fewer rounds by doing more work in each round? This seems very unlikely, as this is akin to increasing the batch size in centralized learning, and expecting a significant decrease in the number of batches required for convergence. There is typically <em id="S7.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">some</em> decrease in the number of batches with increasing batch size, but it often is not significant. In reconciliation-based methods, this may be particularly inefficient as local training rounds cause the active sites to diverge and simply makes it more difficult to reconcile them. IST may have another advantage in that regard, in that more active sites does not increase communication for IST, it simply means that each site gets less of the full model. As long as each site can tolerate local learning using a smaller model (due to partitioning more ways), the learning may benefit from seeing a greater variety of data in each round. This certainly seems to be the case in when moving from 2% to 6%, which benefits IST.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have designed a set of experiments to evaluate FL methods. Among the issues considered were what were the appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy alone makes little sense), whether to use a pre-trained backbone, and the effect of connectivity on the efficiency of the learning. We find that overall, the method of decomposition of a neural network into independent subnetworks seems to be the best option. This has the benefit of decreasing communication and computation compared to “reconciliation-based” methods that train a copy of the model at each site, as the model is sharded, rather than broadcasted.</p>

<p id="A3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These tables generally follow the same trends that we observed in the skewed 10% participation experiments in the main paper. Again, we see that IST methods perform best across all three metrics on the Birds, Flwrs, Aircrft, and Textres dataset, but is inconsistent on the Cars and CFAR datasets. Averaging algorithms, in particular FedAvg, fare better on these two datasets. As we also addressed in the main paper, increasing client participation does not consistently nor significantly increase accuracies and generally increases the GFLOP and GB costs.</p>

<div id="A3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, we note that moving from 100 clients to the 1000 client population cases, the final accuracies greatly increase across all algorithms and datasets, and are more closely aligned with the final accuracies of the i.i.d. cases. This effect merits further investigation, although we believe this phenomenon is due to the increased population mitigating the effects of non-i.i.d. data.</p>

We consider the number of local rounds of stochastic gradient descent as a hyperparameter with either 1, 5, or 25 iterations. Other hyperparameters are algorithmic specific. Unless otherwise stated, we selected the parameters by table-scanning all combinations of possible hyperparameter configurations and optimizing on each of FLOP and GB transferred.
