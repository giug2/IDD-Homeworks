<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Integrating native AI support into the network architecture is an essential objective of 6G.
Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a potential paradigm, facilitating decentralized AI model training across a diverse range of devices under the coordination of a central server.
However, several challenges hinder its wide application in the 6G context, such as malicious attacks and privacy snooping on local model updates, and centralization pitfalls.
This work proposes a trusted architecture for supporting FL, which utilizes Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN), including three key features.
First, a pre-processing layer employing homomorphic encryption is incorporated to securely aggregate local models, preserving the privacy of individual models.
Second, given the distributed nature and graph structure between clients and nodes in the pre-processing layer, GNN is leveraged to identify abnormal local models, enhancing system security.
Third, DLT is utilized to decentralize the system by selecting one of the candidates to perform the central server’s functions.
Additionally, DLT ensures reliable data management by recording data exchanges in an immutable and transparent ledger.
The feasibility of the novel architecture is validated through simulations, demonstrating improved performance in anomalous model detection and global model accuracy compared to relevant baselines.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">6G regards AI as a crucial enabler driving innovation in network architecture.
In addition to utilizing AI for intelligent communication networks, 6G aims to achieve native AI support, transcending the traditional role of delivery channels for collected data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Federated Learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm with efficient communication, emerges as a promising solution for extracting valuable information from dispersed client data while ensuring privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
A central server distributes the training process across multiple clients, with each client performing local computations on its own data, and iteratively exchanging model parameters to improve model quality.
It holds diverse potentials across vertical industries, including smart cities, healthcare and other domains involving extensive data exchanges and analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Recent advancements in decentralized computing and communication capabilities of mobile networks have further facilitated the provision of FL services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, several challenges hinder the wide application of FL in the 6G context.
From a <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">security</span> perspective, detecting and addressing anomalous models pose notable obstacles due to the restriction of analyzing only the model updates without direct access to the raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Adversarial clients may launch poisoning attacks to impair the model performance and disrupt the training process.
From a <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">privacy</span> view, while FL offers a considerable improvement over centralized training, it is still susceptible to information leakage through the observation of clients’ shared model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
From an <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">architectural</span> standpoint, with massive connectivity, the central server may struggle to handle the increased load.
The centralized design for accessing and processing model parameters is prone to a single point of failure and limited scalability.
Besides, such a centralized system lacks a proactive mechanism for demonstrating compliance in data management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To enhance privacy preservation in FL, secure aggregation has been recognized as a pivotal technology, enabling the combination of model updates without disclosing individual contributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising cryptographic method for implementing secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
It allows the server to perform computations directly on encrypted updates to obtain the desired encrypted result.
Recent progress in its utility, coupled with increased computing capabilities of communication network entities, have paved the way for its widespread application <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to secure aggregation for privacy issues, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) offers a potential solution to overcome other FL limitations, such as centralization issues and unreliable data management.
DLT ensures transparency and immutability by decentralized peers maintaining a shared ledger for blocks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Each block stores multiple transactions and links to the previous block by containing its cryptographic hash, forming a chronological record <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
The smart contract, a piece of code deployed on a DLT platform, executes automatically when preset conditions are met <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
It reduces the need for intermediaries and streamlines processes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, considering the complex relationships among data and the distributed nature of FL, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Graphs naturally introduce the inductive bias of connectivity between node pairs, which sets them apart from other data structures like images or sequential data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
GNN iteratively distinguishes nodes based on their attributes, neighbors and connections.
By leveraging the inherent graph structure of data and modeling interactions, GNNs can effectively capture the dependencies and relationships among distributed clients, leading to more accurate and robust models.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent studies have proposed various techniques against privacy leakages, which exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Apart from HE, commonly employed technologies include Differential Privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and secret sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
By adding deliberately designed noise, DP protects individual records while minimizing the impact on data aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a model aggregation algorithm was proposed to balance the trade-off between privacy loss and model performance.
The secret-sharing method distributes copies of secret messages among participants, enabling reconstruction with a certain number of participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
A practical secret-sharing method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> utilized an innovative double-mask structure to protect privacy.
Despite enhanced privacy assurances, these methods pose challenges in identifying anomalous models due to limited access to individual model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Aimed at addressing security threats in FL, considerable effort has been devoted to defense mechanisms.
The vanilla model aggregation method is Federated Averaging (FedAvg), which performs a (weighted) average of model updates to generate global models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Krum is a robust aggregation rule that replaces the average step with a reliable estimate of the mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
It selects the most trusted model as the aggregated result using majority-based and distance-based analysis.
Besides, ML-based approaches have also been extensively explored for anomaly detection, such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
However, these methods require knowledge of the specific data, where encryption is difficult to apply as it alters the spatial location and data distance.
Moreover, the implementations rely on a reliable third party or a centralized setting, which is not feasible in some scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Previous studies have separately explored defense mechanisms against security and privacy attacks in FL, but there is limited focus on developing combined solutions that address both threats simultaneously.
An attempt was made in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, but the approach to anomaly detection involves analyzing raw data, raising privacy concerns.</p>

Data storage in DLT is classified into on-chain and off-chain methods.
On-chain storage records model parameters directly on the ledger, while this transparency may raise privacy concerns in FL systems.
Off-chain method stores only pointers of raw data on the chain, where raw data are saved in a separate entity, such as a Distributed Data Storage Entity (DDSE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
DDSE can be implemented through various technologies including Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which employs hashes as keys to provide a scalable and efficient lookup mechanism.

A GNN comprises multiple layers, with each layer creating and aggregating the message from neighboring nodes to update the representation for each node.
This process is repeated across all layers, ultimately generating a rich, high-level representation of the nodes or the whole graph.
GNNs have been widely applied in diverse domains, including node classification, where node embeddings are utilized and a classification head (typically an MLP) is employed.</p>

By leveraging Paillier’s homomorphism, this layer implements secure aggregation and model projection with dimensionality reduction, maintaining data similarity while preventing the recovery of original data.
Thus, subsequent detection of anomaly models is facilitated in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The DLT-DDSE layer is utilized for data management and aggregator selection.
All the data access records are stored as transactions in an immutable ledger.
To upload or download data, entities require authorization from DLT and then proceed accordingly to DDSE where the raw data is stored, with DDSE confirming consistency with DLT.
In addition to data management, DLT employs smart contracts for selecting aggregators, such as by random or round robin, or based on the hash of previous blocks.
The selected aggregator assumes the central server’s responsibility, thereby decentralizing the entire system and enhancing its resilience.
The specific transaction types and data interaction procedures have been clearly defined and described in our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The comparison of our proposed method with the baseline is presented in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-B Proposed Approach ‣ IV ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ‣ Advancing Federated Learning in 6G: A Trusted Architecture with Graph-based Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, where the primary axis displays the detection accuracy of abnormal models and the secondary axis shows the accuracy of abnormal local models.
Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ IV-B Proposed Approach ‣ IV ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ‣ Advancing Federated Learning in 6G: A Trusted Architecture with Graph-based Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a> depicts the effect of increasing the ratio of malicious models, with the abnormal local model accuracy being 94%.
The proposed method receives a minimal impact, with the detection accuracy remaining around 98%.
Conversely, the baseline, which solely relies on model similarity, faces a substantial obstacle, with its accuracy dropping to 86%.
In Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf2" title="In Figure 2 ‣ IV-B Proposed Approach ‣ IV ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ‣ Advancing Federated Learning in 6G: A Trusted Architecture with Graph-based Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>, as perturbation steps increase, the divergence between anomalous and normal models amplifies, simplifying detection.
The novel method achieves increasing accuracy from 95% to 99%, exceeding the baseline performance from 88% to 99%.
In Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf3" title="In Figure 2 ‣ IV-B Proposed Approach ‣ IV ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ‣ Advancing Federated Learning in 6G: A Trusted Architecture with Graph-based Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(c)</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf4" title="In Figure 2 ‣ IV-B Proposed Approach ‣ IV ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ‣ Advancing Federated Learning in 6G: A Trusted Architecture with Graph-based Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(d)</span></a>, changes in client numbers and connections impact the graph structure, but have no influence on the baseline with a detection accuracy of 91%.
Higher connectivity enables better information aggregation, and clients that appear only once in the graph may slightly affect detection, with the lowest detection accuracy being 96%.
Overall, the proposed method outperforms the baseline by leveraging the features of clients and the pre-processing layer, along with their connections.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The majority of time is spent on training (around 40%), encryption (around 16%), projection (around 12%) and decryption (around 26%), while semi-aggregation and analysis occupy only 5% and 0.002% of the total time, respectively.
The increase in the client number has minimal impact on system time due to parallel training and encryption across clients, as well as parallel projection by nodes in the pre-processing layer.
Despite the additional work required for decrypting the projected vector of models with increasing clients, the impact is limited because of the vector’s low dimensionality of 32.
Simulation results indicate that further processing (including pre-processing and decryption) takes longer than encryption in the client part;
however, in practice, it does not present a performance bottleneck as it is conducted in the cloud with superior computing resources.
Despite the overhead introduced by the Paillier scheme, the system effectively preserves privacy by safeguarding individual clients’ model updates, justifying these costs.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work proposes a novel trusted architecture for supporting FL.
DLT is leveraged for reliable data management and decentralized architecture.
A pre-processing layer employing Paillier’s additive homomorphic encryption is incorporated to enhance client privacy protection through secure aggregation.
Considering the graph structure between clients and nodes in the pre-processing layer, GNN is leveraged to identify abnormal models, thereby improving the architecture security.
The proposed architecture enables reliable and secure collaborative machine learning in wireless communications.</p>

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This work is an exploration to apply GNN in FL architecture optimization, taking local models projection and history selection results as client features.
In future work, we plan to incorporate geographical location and communication network characteristics, such as signal strength, into the GNN function for better prediction.</p>
