<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">With the gradual popularization of self-driving, it is becoming increasingly important for vehicles to smartly make the right driving decisions and autonomously obey traffic rules by correctly recognizing traffic signs. However, for machine learning-based traffic sign recognition on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a large amount of traffic sign data from distributed vehicles is needed to be gathered in a centralized server for model training, which brings serious privacy leakage risk because of traffic sign data containing lots of location privacy information. To address this issue, we first exploit privacy-preserving federated learning to perform collaborative training for accurate recognition models without sharing raw traffic sign data.
Nevertheless, due to the limited computing and energy resources of most devices, it is hard for vehicles to continuously undertake complex artificial intelligence tasks.
Therefore, we introduce powerful Spike Neural Networks (SNNs) into traffic sign recognition for energy-efficient and fast model training, which is the next generation of neural networks and is practical and well-fitted to IoV scenarios.
Furthermore, we design a novel encoding scheme for SNNs based on neuron receptive fields to extract information from the pixel and spatial dimensions of traffic signs to achieve high-accuracy training.
<span id="id9.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Numerical results indicate that the proposed federated SNN outperforms traditional federated convolutional neural networks in terms of accuracy, noise immunity, and energy efficiency as well.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to the forecast report from well-known analysis organization Gartner, by 2023, there are more than 740,000 autonomous-ready vehicles added all around the world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. It is obvious that autonomous driving is becoming more and more popular and shows huge potential to realize high-level intelligent transportation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. When driving on the roads, traffic signs are detected and recognized by vehicles with powerful sensors and cameras. These signs play important roles to guide vehicles in an orderly manner and also improving driving safety, which provides significant assistance for vehicle control without interruption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
For example, warning signs remind vehicles to avoid obstacles and be aware of dangerous bends. The indicator signs can help the vehicles to perform pre-processing control and to follow road instructions, e.g, the speed limit on the highway. Therefore, the correct recognition and precise application of traffic signs can provide more perfect assistance for driver assistance systems and even autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, to achieve precious and intelligent traffic sign recognition, the traffic signs are collected by vehicles and then gathered in a centralized server for machine learning-based analysis and recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, these existing schemes have overlooked the privacy concerns of vehicles (e.g., some sensitive location information mapping to specific traffic signs on a particular location), which hinders data gathering and the training collaboration among vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Motivated by the advantages of privacy protection and breaking the data barrier, Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced into various vehicular applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and IoV scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Here, federated learning is a promising privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that allows numerous vehicles to train a globally shared recognition model and only share a local training model without revealing individual raw data (i.e., collected traffic sign pictures) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For traffic sign recognition in IoV, due to limited energy resources and intermittent communications of vehicles, the energy efficiency, scalability, and robustness of model training need to be further enhanced for wide deployment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, traditional FL methods pose challenges to the energy overhead and scalability with the rapid increase of vehicles in IoV. In addition, there exist blurred sensing traffic sign pictures caused by high-speed mobility of vehicles or bad weather conditions, it is increasingly important to improve the robustness of traffic sign recognition in IoV.
All these issues inspire us to propose a new FL framework in this paper, where the emerging Spike Neural Network (SNN) technology is naturally integrated into IoV systems.
The SNNs, which are 3rd generation artificial neural networks inspired by information processing in biology, have been introduced to achieve efficient deep neural network implementation with favorable properties including low power consumption, fast inference, good robustness, and event-driven information processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Therefore, SNNs are a promising choice and highly suitable for training many machine learning tasks in IoV, especially traffic sign recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. To this end, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II-B Federated Learning for Internet of Vehicles ‣ II related work ‣ Efficient Federated Learning with Spike Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we design an efficient SNN-empowered federated learning framework for low-power and privacy-preserving traffic sign recognition.
<span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In each communication round, the networked vehicle uses the local traffic sign dataset to train the SNN model, which is then uploaded to a nearby Road Side Unit (RSU) for aggregation to obtain the global model of the next round.</span>
However, this framework still faces a challenge in encoding traffic sign images for efficient SNNs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In SNNs, the training data needs to be encoded as a set of spike sequences with time steps.
Rate-based encoding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> has been widely used such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which utilizes the pixel intensities of images to extract input features.
The greater the intensity of a single pixel of an image, the more informative the spike sequence it encodes.
This method generally requires very high pixel values to be encoded into a sequence of high-frequency spikes for quick forward propagation in SNNs.
Thus, rate-based coding has limitations when facing blurry traffic sign images captured by vehicles in bad weather conditions.
Inspired by the biological vision, we find that the degree of stimulation of an image on organisms is not only affected by the color depth of the pixels but also related to the different areas observed by the biological retina.
To this end, we propose a novel encoding method for SNNs called Neuronal Receptive Field Encoding (NRFE), which also extracts features from the spatial dimension to achieve high-precision traffic sign recognition.

In particular, vehicle automatic driving applications can display warning signs on the dashboard, actively sense information about the surrounding environment outside the driver’s field of vision and, effectively provide target detection and collision avoidance assistance.
For instance, autonomous driving applications require vehicles to quickly and accurately recognize traffic signs on the roadside.

To this end, we propose a federated spike neural network framework, which provides low power consumption and high-precision traffic sign recognition while ensuring user privacy. <span id="S2.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Furthermore, the symbols of this paper are summarized in Tab. <a href="#S2.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ II-C Low-power Spike Neural Network ‣ II related work ‣ Efficient Federated Learning with Spike Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.</span></p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.5" class="ltx_p">Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising computing paradigm using discrete action potentials (i.e., spikes) that highly mimic the physiological mechanisms by which biological neurons propagate information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
Unlike traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, SNNs use binary spikes to transmit information between layers and layers of the network with less computational cost and extremely low power consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.
<span id="S3.SS2.p1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The low power consumption of SNNs is reflected in the fact that the floating-point product operation in ANNs can be simplified to the accumulation operation of multiple additions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.</span>
Specifically, each neuron maintains a membrane potential level, which integrates the input spike signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
When a neuron receives a sequence of spike signals within a time step <math id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>, its membrane potential will increase, decrease, or remain unchanged.
Once the membrane potential of the neuron exceeds a threshold <math id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\theta" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">θ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝜃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">\theta</annotation></semantics></math>, it generates an output spike signal <math id="S3.SS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S3.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.3.m3.1c">1</annotation></semantics></math> to the next layer of neurons.
Next, the neuron enters a transient refractory period.
At this time, no matter whether any spike information is received, the membrane potential will not change.
If the neuron does not reach the threshold potential within the time step, it will output a spike signal <math id="S3.SS2.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.4.m4.1a"><mn id="S3.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">0</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.4.m4.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1">0</cn></annotation-xml></semantics></math>.
In addition, the membrane potential will also leak during the accumulation process.

Similar to ANNs, the number of neurons in the last layer of SNNs is also determined by the total number of classes in the training dataset.
In this way, the output layer can predict the probability distribution of samples without causing information loss.
Thus, the cross-entropy loss function of SNNs can be expressed as:</p>

However, in SNNs, neurons can only produce spike output when the membrane potential exceeds the threshold, resulting in non-differentiable.
Thus, to overcome this, researchers generally use some alternative functions to approximate the derivative of the threshold function, the most common of which is the piece-wise linear function, such as:</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Batch Normalization (BN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> has the advantages of accelerating the speed of network training and convergence, controlling gradient explosion, and preventing gradient disappearance, which has been widely used in the deep learning model.
However, the BN layer only normalizes a batch of inputs, ignoring the information in the time dimension.
Thus, the naive application of the BN layer in SNN cannot capture the time representation of the spike sequence.
Recently, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> propose a method to update the internal parameters of the BN layer with the time step to improve the SNN training performance, which is called Batch Normalization Through Time (BNTT).
Specifically, after the spike sequence passes through the convolution or linear layer, it will enter the BN layer that expands with the time step <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>, i.e., <math id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> BN layers.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The attention mechanism originates from the fact that humans can reasonably utilize limited visual information processing resources to selectively focus on visual focus areas, and has been widely used in the field of deep learning.
In recent years, many attention models such as Transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, DIN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> and AFM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> have been proposed in natural language processing and image recognition.
Inspired by the attention mechanism, we believe that information in the central region of the neuron receptive field is more likely to activate that neuron to emit spikes, while it is more difficult for those at the edges.
To this end, we propose a novel encoding method for SNNs called Neuronal Receptive Field Encoding (NRFE) for fast and efficient training.
Specifically, we design a Gaussian distribution matrix to simulate the regions observed by neurons, and then combine the pixel features of the image to jointly encode the local traffic sign dataset of vehicles.
Next, we provide more details about the NRFE method as follows.</p>

However, if the input features are large, the gradient passed to the input layer during backpropagation will become large, resulting in a suboptimal model.
Therefore, in order to accelerate the model convergence and prevent gradient explosion, we normalize the input features.

In the receptive field, the pixel is closer to the center, and the greater contribution to the calculation of output features will be.
In other words, the closer the pixel is to the center of the receptive field, the more times it will be convolved.
However, the contribution of all pixels in the receptive field to the output feature is not all the same.

For an image, we consider that pixels in the center of the receptive field and with large values are more likely to activate neurons to emit spike signals.

The choice of a specific encoding method depends on whether the data has relevant information in the temporal and spatial domains, and whether there is noise.
In rate-based coding of SNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the input of each image is coded as a sequence of Poisson spikes according to its pixel intensity.
The probability of a spike in this sequence is positively correlated with the pixel intensity of the image.
However, it generally requires very high pixel values to be encoded into a sequence of high-frequency spikes for quick propagation forward in the network.
Therefore, rate coding has limitations in the face of noisy and low-pixel traffic sign data.
Another common encoding method is temporal-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, which generates the precise time of each spike according to changes in the input signal.
Although this approach has been shown to be effective in practice, it is generally suitable for the fast processing of time series and streaming data.
Thus, it is also inappropriate for traffic sign recognition.
Compared with the above two encoding methods, our proposed encoding scheme based on neuron receptive fields extracts features from pixel and spatial dimensions and is especially suitable for encoding traffic sign data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Autonomous driving applications in IoV may involve multiple fields and need to integrate data from various agencies and departments.
However, the data collected by vehicles usually include private information such as driver location and traveling trajectory.
Therefore, it is generally unrealistic to collect all data on a centralized server.
Federated learning is essentially an encrypted distributed machine learning technology, which provides an effective computing paradigm for executing multi-vehicle autonomous driving tasks.
Furthermore, due to the limited computing and storage resources of most IoV devices (e.g., vehicles), it is impossible to achieve complex artificial intelligence computing tasks.
In contrast, SNNs achieve comparable performance to deep neural networks with relatively low computational cost and extreme energy efficiency, which has been widely used in IoV, such as image classification, target detection, navigation, and motion control.
Thus, based on the automatic driving scenarios of IoV, we propose a federated spike neural network algorithm called <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{FedSNN}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">FedSNN</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">FedSNN</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathrm{FedSNN}</annotation></semantics></math>-<math id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{NRFE}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">NRFE</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">NRFE</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">\mathrm{NRFE}</annotation></semantics></math>, which focuses on a fast and effective coding scheme to achieve low-power and high-performance FL.</p>

For the non-IID settings of data distribution, we simulated class imbalances in the local data distribution of different clients.

Since the SNN layer transmits a binary sequence among layers, maximum pooling will cause a large amount of information to be lost in the next layer.
Therefore, we use the average pool during training.</p>

Obviously, the centralized SNN achieves the best performance thus validating that the spike neural network can be well applied to the image classification tasks in IoV.
However, for IoV scenarios, it is impractical to gather all the sensing traffic signs from distributed vehicles into a centralized database because of the high risk of user privacy leakage.
Therefore, we introduce the paradigm of federated learning to effectively solve the privacy protection issues.

As shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B1 The performance impacts of IID and non-IID setting ‣ V-B Experiment Results ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Efficient Federated Learning with Spike Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the substitution rate is negatively correlated with the model performance. The larger substitution rate brings the lower test accuracy of the final convergence of the model.
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that a larger substitution rate speeds up the convergence of the model. The reason is that the large substitution rate leads to too large model updates, and it is easier to achieve the local optimum, but miss the global optimum. Conversely, the lower substitution rate makes the model update slowly and achieves higher convergence accuracy.

This is because the leakage rate is positively correlated with the probability of neurons being activated.
In detail, the larger leakage rate of the spiking neuron brings the more membrane voltage it retains at the previous moment, and the easier it to activate the neuron to emit the spike.
Moreover, the setting of time steps <math id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.8.m8.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.8.m8.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.8.m8.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.8.m8.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.8.m8.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> is also important for SNNs.
It is difficult for the membrane potential of spike neurons to exceed the threshold voltage if the time step is too small.
An excessively large time step increases the computational complexity and is prone to gradient explosion and over-fitting problems.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In traditional ANNs, a high-precision traffic sign recognition model usually requires a large number of training samples.
However, this increases the cost of collecting data and the time complexity of training the model to a certain extent.
SNNs are the third generation of artificial neural networks inspired by biological information processing, which have the advantages of fast reasoning and event-driven information processing.
To this end, we compare the performance of CNN and SNN for traffic sign image recognition under the FL paradigm.

The difference is that the higher non-IID level results in the slower convergence of the global model.
Interestingly, our proposed method achieves stable performance at all three non-IID levels and differs very little from each other.</p>

Intuitively, the energy consumption of floating-point operations is mainly concentrated in the convolutional layer.
Compared with CNNs, we observe that the energy consumption of SNNs mainly depends on the ratio of activated neurons in each layer of the network.

Specifically, we propose a <math id="S6.p1.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{FedSNN}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.1.m1.1a"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S6.p1.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">FedSNN</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.1.m1.1.1">FedSNN</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.1.m1.1c">\mathrm{FedSNN}</annotation></semantics></math>-<math id="S6.p1.2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{NRFE}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.2.2.m2.1a"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S6.p1.2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">NRFE</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.2.m2.1.1">NRFE</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.2.2.m2.1c">\mathrm{NRFE}</annotation></semantics></math> scheme based on the neuronal receptive field encoding, which realizes the high-precision recognition of road traffic signs in autonomous driving.
Furthermore, as far as we know, we are the first to train FedSNN under the traffic sign dataset, and conduct a comprehensive analysis of performance, adaptability, robustness, and energy efficiency.
Through numerical results, we conclude that in the federated learning scenario of the Internet of Vehicles, SNN has become a viable alternative to CNN with its superior energy efficiency and noise resistance.
Nevertheless, FL still faces challenges in terms of expensive communication overhead, unreliable devices, and security.
There are several possible directions that are worth being studied: I) Due to the binary spike sequences passed between neurons in SNNs, it is promising to improve the aggregation algorithm of FL for efficient communication overhead.
II) Considering that client selection strategies based on SNN-related metrics (such as spike rate) should be designed to improve the performance and convergence speed of FL.
III) It is still necessary to strengthen the security of the <math id="S6.p1.3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{FedSNN}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.3.3.m3.1a"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S6.p1.3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.p1.3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">FedSNN</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.3.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.3.3.m3.1.1">FedSNN</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.3.3.m3.1c">\mathrm{FedSNN}</annotation></semantics></math>-<math id="S6.p1.4.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathrm{NRFE}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.4.4.m4.1a"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S6.p1.4.4.m4.1.1" xref="S6.p1.4.4.m4.1.1.cmml">NRFE</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.4.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.4.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.4.4.m4.1.1">NRFE</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.4.4.m4.1c">\mathrm{NRFE}</annotation></semantics></math> training algorithm to ensure strict confidentiality of user privacy data.
In future work, we will further compare and evaluate these methods for integrating SNNs into FL.</span></p>
