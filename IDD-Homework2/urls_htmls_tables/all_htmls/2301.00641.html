<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, renewable energy (RE) has been widely deployed, such as wind power and photovoltaic. Unlike traditional power plants, RE resources are usually distributed. Therefore, microgrids (MGs) have been paid much attention to utilize the RE. Note that the MG usually works in a local area, and provides the required electricity for a small entity, such as a school, a hospital, or a community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Normally, the main target of MG is to achieve the self-sufficiency of energy via the utilization of RE. However, due to its limited capacity, the MG has to take the risk of power shortage. Specifically, since the user demand and RE are dependent on the user behavior and weather condition, the power demand may exceed the capacity of MG while RE generation may be insufficient, thus causing the power shortage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. For this reason, numerous adjacent MGs are interconnected to form a multi-microgrid (MMG) system. <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">Compared with an isolated MG, the MMG system is more capable of utilizing RE because of its larger capacity. Besides, although these MGs belong to different entities, the energy is allowed to be traded among different MGs, i.e., each MG can actively sell its surplus power when its power generation exceeds the demand, or purchase power from other MGs when the generation is insufficient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.<span id="S1.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
Therefore, the MMG is more promising to achieve energy self-sufficiency compared with an isolated MG.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, because of the complexity of energy management of the MMG, it is essential to adopt an effective scheme. The present studies of MMG energy management can be mainly categorized into two types, i.e., the centralized and decentralized schemes. The former one is based on a centralized energy management center, which could get access to the related energy information of all MGs in the MMG system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Then, this center can well make decisions to achieve the energy self-sufficiency of the MMG system. However, note that the multiple MGs usually belong to different entities, and it is difficult for the centralized management center to acquire operation data of all MGs due to the increasing awareness of privacy protection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, a more popular research direction is the decentralized MMG management scheme. For instance, Ng <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. have proposed the concept of MMG control, which uses the multi-agent approach to achieve the decentralized control of each MG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In addition, Yang <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. have adopted multiple self-decision agents replacing the energy management center for the energy self-sufficiency of participated MGs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Liu <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al</em>. have treated the MMG system as a fully distributed optimization model, which is solved by a robust optimal scheduling algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Moreover, Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> has proposed a multi-agent MMG system, where the individual agent of each MG collects the data from local units and performs optimization separately. In addition, Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> has proposed the MG agents to well utilize the partially observed information, for achieving the optimal energy management of MMG.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text">The aforementioned literature focuses on building accurate optimization models, which can be summarized as the model-based approach. However, there exists an essential drawback, i.e., the model-based approach is merely suited for the predetermined scheduling solution rather than a real-time decision. In other words, the predetermined scheduling is difficult to handle emergencies or the unexpected change in the load demand occurring in the MMG system.<span id="S1.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle this problem, the learning-based approach has been developed in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text">Benefiting from the development of the physics-informed deep learning techniques, the outputs of the black-box model are more generalized and interpretable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.<span id="S1.p6.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
One of the most representative approaches is multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), which is widely deployed in the MMG energy management problem due to its nature of interacting with the physical characteristic of the real world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
For instance, The MADRL used in Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> observes the temperature, energy generation and other physical parameters to control soft load and transaction effectively for MMG. The experiments demonstrate the convergence of these algorithms and emphasize the outperformance of the actor-critic algorithm.
Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposes an energy management approach that takes advantage of a multi-agent model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. This distributed and hierarchical decision mechanism effectively increases the energy self-sufficiency of MMG.
<span id="S1.p6.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Besides, a MADRL method is adopted in Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> to realize the post-disaster resilience of distributed MG system.<span id="S1.p6.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> Aiming to increase the income of the system, the MADRL shows its strong adaptability in different conditions through experiments.
Moreover, the implementation of MADRL would significantly increase the autonomy of each MG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p6.1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">For instance, a MADRL framework based on the deep neural network is proposed in Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to improve the operational performance and autonomy of each participant MG.<span id="S1.p6.1.1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> sets the agents in different MGs for the distributed control and achieve higher MG autonomy. To balance the benefits of the MMG participants and guarantee the efficiency, Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposes an equilibrium selection multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on Q-learning to promote the autonomy of MG operation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">However, since the MADRL technology requires massive data to train the MG agent, the concern of user privacy is raised. The data of the users can be utilized to analyze their habits and even their life tracks. In the case of MMG energy management, to train an effective agent with a high generalization, massive energy operation data should be collected from different MGs. <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text">However, although each MG aims to pursure a better performance through experiences sharing, they may be not willing to submit their processing data because of privacy awareness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, the security during data transmission cannot be guaranteed.<span id="S1.p7.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text">To tackle the above issues, we introduce an emerging distributed learning approach, namely federated learning (FL), for training MADRL in the MMG energy management via physics-informed reward <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.<span id="S1.p8.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> In other words, we apply the FL to protect user privacy and guarantee data security while ensuring the generalization of each MG agent in the MMG system. Specifically, each MG is controlled by an agent, which deploys a recent deep reinforcement model, namely proximal policy optimization (PPO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Each agent firstly executes the self-training according to the local energy operation data of each MG to maximize the physics-informed reward, i.e., the economic operation and self energy-sufficiency.
Then, the agents upload their local model parameters, such as the weights and biases of the model, to a server. After that, these parameters are aggregated by the server to construct a global model, which will be broadcasted to each MG and replace the local model. In this way, agents share their experiences through the FL mechanism, which thus enhances their generalization<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span><span id="footnote1.1" class="ltx_text">Since the MGs in the MMG belong to different kinds of entities, their local operation data manifest the perference of local users. Thus the agent trained by local data would be confronted of performances decline when operating in other MGs, and this phenoma is termed as the generalization decrease of the MG agent.</span></span></span></span> compared with the local training. Moreover, the FL mechanism only requires model parameters, and the operation data of each MG would stay locally. Therefore, the user privacy and data security can be guaranteed.</span></span></p>

<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text">(1) A MMG system model is developed for the deployment of FL, where each MG contains conventional generators (CGs), batteries (BAs), renewable energy generators (REGs), load and the energy management center. Then, a server is introduced to implement the FL mechanism which can communicate with MGs and aggregates the parameters of the MG agent, such as the weight and bias of the neural network models. Since the server would not perform as a center of MMG that guides the decisions of each MG, MGs would endow a high autonomy and suffer from less risk of privacy leakage.<span id="S1.p10.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The decentralized MMG system includes numerous MGs that are connected to a distribution power network. Usually, an energy management center is set in each MG, which performs as an agent to conduct self-training and control the dispatchable elements, such as conventional generators (CGs), batteries (BAs), etc. In this section, to describe the energy management model of the MMG system more clearly, we firstly introduce the isolated MG model with the MDP format before developing the MMG model.</p>

Normally, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A The Isolated Microgrid Energy Management Model ‣ III The Decentralized Multi-Microgrid Energy Management Model ‣ Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach via Physics-Informed Reward for Multi-Microgrid Energy Management" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a), a MG is constructed by five types of elements: renewable power generators, BA, CG, conventional load (CL) and energy management center. Note that BAs and CGs are dispatchable since their outputs are controlled by the management center. On the contrary, because of the high uncertainties of RE, the outputs of REG cannot be controlled. Additionally, the energy management center is termed as the agent that controls these dispatchable elements by observing the state of MG operation. Following this structure, the Oak Ridge national laboratory distributed energy control communication lab microgrid test system (ORNL-MG) is selected as the real-world case in this paper, which is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A The Isolated Microgrid Energy Management Model ‣ III The Decentralized Multi-Microgrid Energy Management Model ‣ Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach via Physics-Informed Reward for Multi-Microgrid Energy Management" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b).<span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The design of the reward significantly impacts the performance of the DRL training. A specific physical task-oriented reward would endow interpretability to the strategy of the agent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, in some classical reinforcement learning tasks, such as CartPole <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and Atari Games <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, the design of their rewards is independent of the physical characteristic of the problem. For instance, in CartPole, the reward is set as 0 if the action is available. Such the intuitive design of reward may mislead the agent thus slowing down the training process and decreasing the interpretability of the agent strategy, it is not suitable for the MG energy management. <span id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Normally, the MG agent is expected to operate economically while ensuring the self energy-sufficiency. Therefore, considering the physical characteristic of the MG, the reward is designed as physics-informed to satisfy the two explicit targets, i.e., the training of the agent and realizing the requirements of operation cost and self energy-sufficiency, simultaneously. The reward function is defined as follows.<span id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed above, the MMG is decentralized, thus each MG agent has a high autonomy. However, the decentralized structure threatens the generalization performance of the agent, because the diversity of the data in isolated MG is limited, which may make the agent getting trap into a local optima. To tackle this issue, we propose a federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (F-MADRL) algorithm. The FL is used to improve the generalization of the agent during training while ensuring data privacy.</p>

Since the FL mechanism averages the parameters of the MG agents, the reward value of each agent would dramatically change in the two adjacent phases and all three MG agents receive benefits from this.</p>

However, after applying the FL mechanism, its reward raises at the 500th epoch and converges at -15059.85 at the end of phase 2. Besides, although the MG2 agent converges in phase 1, the FL mechanism substantially renews its parameters and further raises the reward to -3524.99 in the second phase. As for the MG3 agent, the benefit of the FL mechanism is mainly shown in the third phase, which helps the agent escape from the local optimal converged at phase 2 and finally achieve a higher reward at the end of the training. In summary, the FL mechanism can be used to get rid of the local optimum, which is caused by insufficient training data due to privacy constraints.</span></p>

Therefore, the demands of MG1 are all unsatisfied during the 24 hours. Moreover, the scheduling of BA generation obtained by the agent mainly considers the power balance between its charging and discharging. In the 1st hour, the power demand of MG1 is 457.7 kW, which is higher than the capacity of MG1, thus the agent chooses to discharge the battery for demand supply. Since MG1 operates in the energy self-insufficient state, it requires external power from other MGs and distribution power system, which is achieved by the transaction mechanism in the MMG system. Even the unbalanced demands of MG1 are as high as -402 kW at 20:00, these power shortages can be supplied by other MGs and the distribution power network. This is the reason why the MG1 agent does not fully operate its CG and BA all the time. The agent learns that the energy transaction is more economic than generating power by itself.</p>

Wherein, the 1st and 50th iterations would present the training performance in the early stages, the 500th iteration is located at the end of the first federated phase and the other three iterations are set at the convergent state of the reward value.

In addition, since the performance of the F-MADRL is better than those of comparative algorithms in both energy self-sufficient and self-insufficient states, it can be concluded that the F-MADRL has a better generalization performance.</span></span></p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text">The comparisons clarify the introduction of the FL mechanism leads to performance diversity between the proposed F-MADRL and the other three algorithms.<span id="S5.SS4.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> Since the MG agents trained by PPO-MADRL, A2C-MADRL and TRPO-MADRL are only based on the local operation data of MG due to the limitation of privacy and thus causing lower diversity of the training data. Consequently, the decision-making ability of MG agents would decline. The introduction of the FL mechanism alleviates this drawback. By using FL, the experiences of MG agents can be shared without threatening user privacy and data security. In this way, the generalization ability of the agent would be improved, as verified in the above experiments.
Therefore, the comparisons conducted in this section demonstrate the effectiveness of introducing the FL mechanism in the MADRL algorithm and also reveal a better generalization of F-MADRL.</span></span></p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the multi-microgrids system energy management. <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">A decentralized MMG model is built first, which includes numerous isolated MGs and an agent is used to control the dispatchable elements of each MG to achieve the physics-informed reward.<span id="S6.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> Due to the privacy protection and data security, the F-MADRL is implemented to train the agents. First, each agent adopts the self-training. <span id="S6.p1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Then, the FL mechanism is introduced to build a global agent that aggregates the parameters of all local agents on the server and replaces the local MG agent with the global one.<span id="S6.p1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> Therefore, the experiences of each agent can be shared without threatening the privacy and data security.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">The case studies are conducted on a MMG with three isolated MGs. The convergence and the performance of F-MADRL are illustrated first. Then, explanations of the strategy of the three MG agents are presented by decomposing the physics-informed reward under different iterations. Afterwards, by comparing with PPO-MADRL, A2C-MADRL and TRPO-MADRL, the F-MADRL achieves higher test rewards, which means a better generalization. Therefore, it indicates the performance enhancement of introducing the FL mechanism in the MADRL and also demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed F-MADRL.<span id="S6.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
In this paper, the uncertainty of renewable energy is not considered because its complexity will cause difficulties in the training of F-MADRL and reduce the accuracy of the MG agent strategy. This issue is worth investigating in our future work.</span></span></p>
