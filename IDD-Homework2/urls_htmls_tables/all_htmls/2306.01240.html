<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" lang="en-US">Learning an effective global model on private and decentralized datasets has become an increasingly important challenge of machine learning when applied in practice. Existing distributed learning paradigms, such as Federated Learning, enable this via model aggregation which enforces a strong form of modeling homogeneity and synchronicity across clients. This is however not suitable to many practical scenarios. For example, in distributed sensing, heterogeneous sensors reading data from different views of the same phenomenon would need to use different models for different data modalities. Local learning therefore happens in isolation but inference requires merging the local models to achieve consensus. To enable consensus among local models, we propose a feature fusion approach that extracts local representations from local models and incorporates them into a global representation that improves the prediction performance. Achieving this requires addressing two non-trivial problems. First, we need to learn an alignment between similar feature components which are arbitrarily arranged across clients to enable representation aggregation. Second, we need to learn a consensus graph that captures the high-order interactions between local feature spaces and how to combine them to achieve a better prediction. This paper presents solutions to these problems and demonstrates them in real-world applications on time series data such as power grids and traffic networks.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the scalability and practicality of machine learning applications in situations where training data are becoming increasingly decentralized and proprietary, Federated Learning (FL)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>, Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite> has been proposed as a new model training paradigm that allows data owners to collaboratively train a common model without having to share their private data with others. The FL formalism is therefore poised to resolve the computation bottleneck of model training on a single machine and the risk of privacy violation, in light of recent policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Albrecht, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL requires a strong form of homogeneity and synchronicity among the data owners (clients) that might not be ideal in practice. First, it requires all clients to agree in advance to a common model architecture and parameterization. Second, it requires clients to synchronously communicate their model updates to a common server, which assembles the local updates into a global learning feedback. This is rather restrictive in cases where different clients draw observations from different data modalities of the phenomenon being modeled. It leads to heterogeneous data complexities across clients, which in turn requires customized forms of modeling. Otherwise, enforcing a common model with high complexity might not be affordable to clients with low compute capacity; and vice versa, switching to a model with low complexity might result in the failure to unlock important inferential insights from data modalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A variant of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Hardy et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, Hu et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>, named vertical FL (VFL), has been proposed to address the first challenge, which embraces the concept of vertically partitioned data. This concept is figuratively named through cutting the data matrix vertically along the feature axis, rather than the data axis. Existing approaches maintain separate local model parameters distributed across clients and global parameters on a central server. All parameters are then learned together, which causes a practical drawback:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Coordination overhead among clients and the central server, such as engineering protocols that enable multiple rounds of communication (i.e., synchronicity) and coordination effort (i.e., homogeneity) to converge on universal choices of models and training algorithms, would be required, which can be practically expensive depending on the scale of the application.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate both constraints on homogeneity and synchronicity<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Note that in our case, synchronicity requires co-training among clients which is a weaker constraint than its usual meaning of further requiring clients to synchronize their updates per iteration.</span></span></span> satisfactorily, we ask the following question and subsequently develop an answer to it:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Can we separate global consensus prediction from local model training?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As shown later in our experiments, we will address this question in a real-world context of the national electricity grid, over which thousands of phasor measurement units (PMUs) were deployed to monitor the grid condition and data were recorded in real-time by each PMU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">Smartgrid.gov, </a>]</cite>. PMU measurements, as time series data, are owned by several parties, each of which may employ different technologies leading to heterogeneous recordings under varying sampling frequencies and measured attributes. These data can be used to train machine learning models that identify grid events (e.g., fault, oscillation, and generator trip). Such an event detection system relies on collective series measurements at the same time window but distributed across owners. Using VFL to build a common model on such decentralized and heterogeneous data is plausible but not practical, because of a lack of autonomy to facilitate coordination among owners.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Main Contribution.</span> To resolve the challenge, we introduce a feature fusion perspective to this setting, which aims to minimize coordination among clients and maximize their autonomy via a local–global model framework. Therein, each client trains a customized local model with its data modalities. The training is independent and incurs no coordination. Once trained, local feature representations of each client can then be extracted from the penultimate layer of the corresponding local models. Then, a central server collects and aggregates these representations into a more holistic global representation, used to train a model for global inference. There are two technical challenges that need to be addressed to substantiate the envisioned framework.</p>

<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C1.</span> <span id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">There is an ambiguity regarding the correspondence between components of local feature representations across different clients.</span> This ambiguity arises because local models were trained separately in isolation and there is no mechanism to enforce that their induced feature dimensions would be aligned. As a matter of fact, it is possible to permute the induced feature dimensions without changing the prediction outcome. Thus, if two models are trained separately, they might end up looking at the same feature space but with permuted dimensions.</p>

</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">To address <span id="S1.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C1</span>, note that the feature dimension alignment problem is discrete in nature; furthermore, there is no direct feedback to optimize for such alignment. To sidestep this challenge, we develop a neuralized alignment layer whose parameters are differentiable and can therefore be part of a larger network, including the feature aggregation and prediction layers, which can be trained end-to-end via gradient back-propagation (Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Aligning Representations ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). To address <span id="S1.p11.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C2</span>, we employ graph neural networks as the global inference model, where the graph corresponds to the explicit or implicit relational structure of the data owners. As such a graph might not be given in advance, we treat the combinatorial graph structure as a random variable of a product of Bernoulli distributions whose (differentiable) parameters can also be optimized via gradient-based approach (Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Learning a Consensus Graph ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>).

This is an alternative view to VFL but as elaborated above, is more applicable when iterative training synchronicity is not possible among clients (Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Federated Feature Fusion (F<sup id="S2.p1.2.1" class="ltx_sup">3</sup>) is a new but more practical setup for VFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Hu et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>; it aims to enable collaboration between data owners that possess private access to different sets of features describing the same set of training data points. However, unlike VFL which require clients to synchronize their training processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>, Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Fu et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Cheng et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, Hu et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Diao et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite> in multiple iterations of communication, F<sup id="S2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sup">3</sup> allows data owners to train their own local models in isolation and only requires one round of communication in which local feature representations induced from the heterogeneously pre-trained local models are shared with a trusted server for feature fusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Relation to FL with Heterogeneous Clients.</span> We note that similar ideas on extending federated learning to accommodate clients with heterogeneous models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Tan et al., <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">a</a>, Lin et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>]</cite> has been proposed. However, these methods are still restricted to horizontal settings. Local models still need to operate on the same feature space and some of which also require client models to be trained together via multiple rounds of communication. As such, their focuses are on addressing different forms of heterogeneities: (1) heterogeneous data distributions; (2) heterogeneous model architectures; and (3) heterogeneous pre-training, which are all important but are different from feature heterogeneities, which is a new form of heterogeneities we are seeking to address.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">To further emphasize on the novelty of our setting and solution significance, we review and discuss the formulation of VFL and F<sup id="S2.p3.2.1" class="ltx_sup">3</sup> below, which argues with concrete, real-life examples why the F<sup id="S2.p3.2.2" class="ltx_sup">3</sup> setting is more practical and how this practicality would entail significant technical challenges that necessitate new solutions in Sections <a href="#S4" title="4 Aligning Representations ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and <a href="#S5" title="5 Learning a Consensus Graph ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

Instead of owning the same set of features for different sets of data points as in HFL, the data owners in VFL now own different sets of features for the same set of data points; and they share a common label set of these data points.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">From the existing literature, two lines of work are noted. One takes the data matrix literally – by assuming tabular data and studying linear models – where model parameters have natural correspondence to the data parts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Hardy et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, Nock et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>, Heinze et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite>. Often, these approaches are hard to generalize to complex data with many owners. Another line of work advocates the use of models with modular structure in which separate parts of the model are responsible to locally aggregate different sets of local features owned by different owners; and a global parameterization is used to combine these local features. This is similar in spirit to F<sup id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_sup">3</sup> but require clients to synchronize the training processes of their assigned model parts, which incurs expensive communication and creates dependence among the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Hu et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Note that the approach proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hu et al.

<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">However, in exchange for this practicality, two key challenges arise. First, as local models are separately trained, the correspondence between components of induced feature representations across local models become ambiguous since there is no mechanism to enforce their alignment. Second, for the same reason, there are potential innate local interactions among subsets of clients and a naive concatenation or averaging of their corresponding feature presentations will likely ignore such interactions, resulting in decreasing performance. These correspond to high-level challenge <span id="S2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C1</span> and <span id="S2.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C2</span> in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> which will be addressed in Sections <a href="#S4" title="4 Aligning Representations ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and <a href="#S5" title="5 Learning a Consensus Graph ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> as our key technical contributions.</p>

For example, there are cases in which data owners prefer to only release pre-trained models for the collaboration, which are not updatable.

A panel of time series corresponds to a specific time window and the series collectively represent one data point, which the event detection system classifies. In this simplified illustration, each data owner possesses one series recorded by one PMU; but in practice they may own different amounts of PMUs (and thus series). Moreover, the series may differ in length because of varying sampling frequencies; and the series are multivariate with possibly different number of variates. All these variations contribute to feature heterogeneity, which necessitates the construction of separate local models. Note that if an event does not cascade over the entire grid, some local models may report event whereas others report normal, resulting in conflicting opinions. A consensus global model is responsible to resolve the conflict. Additionally, missing data may occur.</p>

This way, no data sharing is invoked and privacy is of minimal concern. However, because the local models lack a global vision and may be conflicting, a central (global) model is key to coordinating the local opinions for final prediction. To maintain autonomy, local models are frozen once pre-trained and will not join the training of the global model. Data owners send local data representations to a centralized server for global model training (and inference). In other words, the global model queries neither the raw data nor the local models from data owners.

First, when the latent dimensions have semantic meaning – e.g. when the local models are trained to yield disentangled representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Higgins et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite> – each latent feature of the local representations may not match, because an arbitrary permutation of the latent dimensions does not change a local model. Second, a naive mean pooling as in (<a href="#S3.Ex1" title="3 Federated Feature Fusion ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) misses the inter-dependencies between local data, leading to a less well performing global model. Such inter-dependencies occur in the power grid example because of the physics of an electricity network. Hence, we use latent alignment to address the first problem and graph neural network to address the second one. Incorporating these two components, we show the full proposed framework in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Federated Feature Fusion ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3 Federated Feature Fusion ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Security in Transmitting Data Representation.</span> Transmitting data representation might risk exposing raw data and mitigating such risks in multiple rounds of communication is often non-trivial. However, in our case, there is a single communication round so sanitizing the data representation does not pose a new challenge. It can be addressed using a variety of existing, well-established techniques such as Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Shamir, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">1979</a>]</cite>. Each local representation (a secret) can be splitted into multiple shares distributed to multiple central entities who process and combine the results to reproduce the desired result. As the central entities process the shares independently and only communicate the results to a coordinator, the SSS protocol can guarantee no single central entity would have enough information to access any local representations.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of federated learning was first coined by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">McMahan et al. [<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite> and it has attracted surging interests since then. Recent literature reviews <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>, Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite> have comprehensively studied the topic, summarized systems and infrastructures, and also suggested open problems. Among these, one interesting direction is a new family <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Hardy et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, Nock et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>, Heinze et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite> of federated learning that studies a federated scenario where features (instead of samples) are split across owners. This setting bears resemblance to our federated feature fusion scenario, but a key distinction is all literature in this direction focuses on local models that can be trained together whereas in our scenarios, local models are trained in isolation to avoid the cost and overhead of coordination among different parties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To build consensus among local models, our framework learns parameter matrices to align their local representations. Such alignments similarly appear in model fusion, where a number of models are fused together into a common model through aligning model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Yurochkin et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>]</cite>. In the context of deep learning, if the neural networks come from the same model family, their weights can be matched layer-wise, even if the numbers of weights are different <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Yurochkin et al., <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>, Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>. The referenced work treats the problem as a bipartite graph matching, where the cost matrix is inferred from maximum a posteriori estimation. Then, the Hungarian algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Kuhn, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">1955</a>]</cite> is applied to find the matching. In our work, instead we treat the permutation alignment as a differentiable parameterization with the help of Sinkhorn–Knopp <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sinkhorn and Knopp, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">1967</a>, Mena et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>, Emami and Ranka, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite>, so that it can be learned end-to-end with other parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our framework also advocates learning a graph of data owners in the global model. Graph structure learning appears under various contexts. One field of study is grounded in the context of probabilistic graphical models, whereby a directed acyclic structure is learned. Gradient-based approaches in this context include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zheng et al. [<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>], Yu et al. [<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>], Lachapelle et al. [<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, a general graph may still be useful without resorting to causality. Recent approaches supporting GNN-based modeling include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Kipf et al. [<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>], Franceschi et al. [<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>], Wu et al.

All local models are LSTM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>]</cite> with the same hyperparameters, but pre-trained separately by using local data.

We first show that local models do not produce consistent predictions, which rationalizes the effort of training a global model and performing federated feature fusion. For each datum, we compute the entropy of the predicted labels and summarize the entropies for all data into a distribution, plotted in Figure <a href="#S7.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 7 Experiments ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study federated feature fusion, which presents a less addressed scenario of federated learning where data owners or clients need to customize their own local models to accommodate different sets of features. Unlike federated learning, the clients need to learn their own model separately in isolation and only communicate their local feature representations afterwards. We motivate the practicality of federated feature fusion with a power grid example and propose a local–global model framework for it. Two important components of the framework are the alignment of the data representations produced by local models and the learning of the global model by using a graph neural network. Comprehensive experiments suggest the feasibility and the effectiveness of federated feature fusion. We release our code at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/matenure/federated_feature_fusion" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/matenure/federated_feature_fusion</a>.</p>

[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite>. The former was collected from loop detectors in the highway of Los Angles, CA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Jagadish et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>]</cite> and the latter was collected by the California Transportation Agencies Performance Measure System. Both data sets recorded several months of data at the resolution of five minutes. The network graphs are available, which were constructed by imposing a radial basis function on the pairwise distance of sensors at a certain cutoff.</p>
</div>
<div id="A5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The data sets were originally prepared for forecasting tasks and hence no labeling information exists. We adapt the data for classification. Specifically, we split the time series on the hour, forming hourly windows. We label each window as whether or not it corresponds to rush hour. For proof of concept, we specify 07:00–10:00 and 16:00–19:00 as rush hour and the others non-rush hour. We note that in the original data sets, one of the attributes is time. We remove this attribute to avoid triviality and retain only the speed attribute.</p>
</div>
<div id="A5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The specification of rush hours may not be highly accurate, but it is a sensible practice to cope with the nonexistence of labeling information. Intuitively, the signal of rush hour comes from reduced traffic speed, but not every location of the network experiences traffic jam. Hence, the diverse traffic patterns inside the same time window under a single label causes nontrivial challenges for local models to discern. Therefore, the need of a global consensus model is justified and it fits well the federated feature fusion scenario.</p>

No personally identifiable information is present. The suffixes B and C indicate the interconnects of the grid. The data sets come with thousands of annotated grid events spanning a period of two years; they form the classification labels. Many variables (attributes) of the grid condition are recorded; we select only the voltage magnitude and the current magnitude, because they appear to be the strongest signals for event detection based on domain knowledge, and also because more data are available for these two variables. The grid topology is not available.</p>
</div>
<div id="A5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For each event, we select a one-second window from the three-minute window that covers the approximate annotated event time, based on the largest z-score. We retain a sampling frequency of 30Hz, even though some data are 60Hz. Furthermore, a large amount of data are missing in the raw data. We impute the series by using <span id="A5.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">pandas.DataFrame.interpolate(method = ’linear’, limit_direction = ’both’)</span> from the Python <span id="A5.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">pandas</span> package. This way, a windowed series is complete if it ever has raw data. Even so, many series are entirely empty, which corresponds to the scenario illustrated by Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> of the main text.

<p id="A7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The soft and hard alignment approaches have pros and cons. The hard approach maintains the correspondence of each feature dimension of the latent vectors while the soft approach does not. Maintaining the dimension correspondence is an advantage, especially for local models that produce disentangled latent representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Higgins et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite>, because each feature dimension is equipped with a semantic meaning that controls a certain aspect of the data. On the other hand, the soft approach is more straightforward and the hard approach is based on an algorithm that barely converges. In practice, we observe that two approaches deliver similar performance. We list the results for both approaches in Table <a href="#A7.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ Appendix G Soft and Hard Feature Alignment ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, and we visualize the hard alignment matrix learned on each dataset Figure <a href="#A7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Appendix G Soft and Hard Feature Alignment ‣ Federated Learning of Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graphs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, to help readers understand the feature alignment.</p>
