<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Over the years, the popularity and usage of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices in several healthcare services are increased. Among the services that benefit from the usage of such devices is predictive analysis, which can improve early diagnosis in e-health. However, due to the limitations of wearable IoT devices, challenges in data privacy, service integrity, and network structure adaptability arose. To address these concerns, we propose a platform using federated learning and private blockchain technology within a fog-IoT network. These technologies have privacy-preserving features securing data within the network. We utilized the fog-IoT network’s distributive structure to create an adaptive network for wearable IoT devices. We designed a testbed to examine the proposed platform’s ability to preserve the integrity of a classifier. According to experimental results, the introduced implementation can effectively preserve a patient’s privacy and a predictive service’s integrity. We further investigated the contributions of other technologies to the security and adaptability of the IoT network. Overall, we proved the feasibility of our platform in addressing significant security and privacy challenges of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare through analysis, simulation, and experimentation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The usage of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare is rising. Due to their availability and sensing capability, these devices collect physiological data from patients and provide real-time diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Wearable IoT devices have caused remote healthcare to make a paradigm shift into predictive diagnosis and reliable early detection. The data collected by these devices partnered with different learning techniques aid in predictive healthcare services. Doctors can analyze data such as their patient’s activities and accurately predict anomalies and threats against their health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. They can also prescribe treatments for preventing and addressing these detected concerns. However, this breakthrough has limitations in its technology. Challenge within a network that employs wearable IoT devices cause impasses in predictive healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An open issue for wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare is the amount of data it needs to be effective. A large amount of personal data is collected, resulting in security and privacy concerns due to the nature of the data used for analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The wearable devices’ limitations on processing capabilities lead to vulnerabilities and potential leakages in sensitive patient information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Another issue is the integrity and reliability of the service<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Structuring healthcare to prioritize certain aspects can cause trade-offs in others. Service integrity is crucial for this field in remote healthcare that relies on wearable data accuracy and predictive model precision. One more issue is the adaptability of the network that deploys and serves these predictive healthcare services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Wearable IoT device standardization is a significant concern to IoT networks due to the heterogeneity it introduces. This diversity results in demands for continuous maintenance and updates to the medical server to ensure that it is up to date with every newly introduced wearable IoT device. As a result, concerns about adaptability limit the healthcare network from fully remaining relevant and sustainable over long stretches of its service.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Wearable IoT devices can form a network of sensing devices that collect data from points of interest for predictive analysis. In predictive healthcare, these devices collect physiological information from patients for better clinical decisions and to provide a prediction. Each obtained statistic reflects the status of their health, which can identify future issues and potential risks. A benefit of using wearable IoT devices in healthcare is to reduce hospital congestion and medical examination costs via remote diagnoses and long-distance patient monitoring. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, they introduce a wearable Tele-ECG system for heart rate monitoring. The proposed design merges the latest technologies in textile electrodes (TE), Bluetooth low energy (BLE), and smartphones to create a portable means of monitoring and evaluating the condition of a patient’s heart for potential anomalies. With features such as geographical tracking, medical history storage, and remote patient monitoring, the system establishes a light and cost-effective alternative for patients suffering from heart issues that need constant observation and evaluation.</p>

The survey includes wearable sensors as one of the leading technologies that enable advancements in predictive healthcare IoT. Services are now made remote and analytic. Patients can use technologies and wearable sensors that can help give doctors early information on potential causes and triggers of health complications. As a result, there is improvement in predictive anomaly detection without constraints in geographical location and data resource availability. Also, these devices widen the scope of medical centres toward their patients. Doctors can use trend and behaviour analysis to pinpoint anomalies in a patient’s health.

<div id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Introducing wearable devices to collect patient data adds more endpoints to the server of the healthcare service. Data collection and monitoring are convenient due to these remote services. However, introducing more devices introduces more vulnerabilities to the network. Increasing the endpoints increases the potential areas where malicious users can attack and steal data. As a result, there is a greater demand for better security as the network grows. Also, privacy becomes a concern due to the sensitive information transmitted from the wearable device to the server. Therefore, network security and data privacy concerns grow as the network expands with more wearable devices.</p>

They aim to strengthen the encryption of the information transmitted from the patient to the medical centre. This strategy achieves forward privacy preservation, which results in a more guaranteed security system for users. Another example that aims for privacy preservation is in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An advantage of using wearable IoT devices in healthcare is the real-time diagnosis and early detection of illness and medical anomalies within a patient. However, this can be affected by the quality of the sensor and the data processing scheme behind the service. Potential misdiagnosis is high if the sensor or the evaluation method is not up to standard. Another source of error could come from how the data is collected and stored on the server. Preserving physiological information integrity obtained from the wearable devices is needed as it travels from patient to server. It ensures that the data is recent and precise to the current status of the source. Also, the data handling during aggregation should be carried out with great precision so that the evaluation of the patient is accurate. A service that can not collect, transmit, and process the data correctly and efficiently will result in inaccurate results. Therefore, the integrity and precision of information a concern that needs addressing for a healthcare service that uses wearable IoT devices to be effective.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Wearable IoT devices introduce different sensors and technologies that collect and process data. Due to their multiple advantages, healthcare services should include them in their systems. However, innovations and improvements are iterative as changes arise often. Although this is a sign of technological growth and advancements in the healthcare sector, it dictates the pace at which current infrastructures need to keep up. Device diversity has always been a concern for IoT networks due to the need for ongoing standardization. As this new technology is still in development, services that use it should be able to follow the development process. It is the same for wearable IoT devices used in healthcare. The demand for technologies that detect each one is high as new diseases and virus strains often appear. However, every new technology introduced a need for the service to adapt. Networks that are less flexible result in losing their resources. Some even end up losing their service and infrastructure altogether. Therefore, there is a need for adaptability and flexibility in the structure of healthcare networks for the continuously evolving nature of wearable IoT devices.</p>

Some sensors in remote healthcare focus on sensing the environment around the patient to ensure that the condition of their surrounding is beneficial to their health. Through it, ambient sensing devices can connect to the healthcare network. As a result, it sets up a platform that can easily integrate and synchronize other devices under it.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a machine learning technique that takes a distributed approach in training its models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. It uses its decentralized strategy to utilize global knowledge collected from its clients. In IoT, federated learning has two components; the client and the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Its flow of operations for federated learning starts with each client training their model using their raw data. Then, the server aggregates and compiles the resulting models into a global model that it redistributes to each client’s use. As a result, each client receives the most optimal model given global knowledge gathered through local training. This procedure is ongoing, and the global model is updated every time the client provides new knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is well-known for its capability of effectively preserving the privacy of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Requiring clients to transmit raw data directly to the server before it is analyzed can cause vulnerabilities. Without a strongly reinforced network, malicious attackers aiming to steal or tamper can target the data. Federated learning protects raw data by creating a strategy that moves the analysis locally. There are lesser avenues for privacy leakages since the server only cares about the resulting trained model from each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. As a result, this structure has an improved trusted architecture compared to standard network arrangements. Aside from its security advantages, federated learning also improves the sustainability of IoT networks. It provides a dynamic learning strategy that keeps global knowledge for services up to date <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Commonly, the server aggregates all the data first before it uses it to train the global model. Federated learning allows new correlations and behaviour changes from collected data to be detected by the server earlier. A fully centralized scheme is slowed down and saturated due to the volume of the data it uses to train its models. Federated learning can reduce training time by running it locally and in parallel. Also, there is a significant reduction in the data size as each client trains its model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Healthcare services that involve wearable IoT devices revolve around continuous data sensing, learning, and analysis. Federated learning can provide a sustainable and decentralized scheme to optimize these services in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. We chose to use this technology in our platform due to all the improvements it can contribute to IoT services, specifically healthcare. Our proposed design is different because we aim to reinforce federated learning with the security provided by blockchains. Also, the foundation of our network will be a fog IoT network. The diversity of wearable IoT devices and their limited processing capabilities is a constraint. However, we can overcome this by moving the training to the fog. This arrangement still allows training locally while considering the processing limits of wearable IoT devices. The result is a decentralized IoT network that can maximize the potential of federated learning in keeping data analysis in healthcare services secure and sustainable.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A blockchain is a cryptographic ledger that provides a distributed service for information storage and security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. This decentralized control establishes a trusted system that will only grant access to users acknowledged by the blockchain ledger <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. This feature protects the data from external or unwanted modifications and makes it immutable.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, they use the unique consent mechanism of blockchains to secure user data privacy in wearable fitness devices. They aim to prove the feasibility of the trustworthiness of blockchains when fortifying the data privacy of wearable IoT device data. Another proposed use for the access control of blockchains is in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. They developed a lightweight authentication scheme that classifies mobile devices and differentiates them from fake data injections or illegitimate users. Their designs show the potential of blockchain technology in securing the healthcare server and the monitoring devices used by its services. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, they use a different feature of blockchains in reinforcing their healthcare service that uses wearable IoT devices. They integrate the encryption model of blockchains to improve the security of the IoT network. Their design creates a searchable encryption technique that assists in securing collected COVID-19 data. It shows the effectiveness of blockchain architecture in helping protect the healthcare IoT network from several security threats like malicious data injection and hijacking sessions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our design differs from the previously presented implementations because we aim to use a private blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Public blockchains use a reward-based protocol called “proof-of-work” (PoW) in granting access to their devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Although this protocol is secure, its processing requirement is a caveat for wearable IoT devices in healthcare. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, we highlighted how some wearable IoT devices are incapable of adapting to this authentication structure due to their low-cost and low-end designs. Therefore, we need a different blockchain architecture that can cater to the design nature of wearable devices. Private blockchains function differently. They incorporate a more trust-based protocol. This approach turns the blockchain into a hyperledger that can regulate its devices based on a list of trusted devices defined by the network owner. Healthcare IoT networks can benefit from this approach more since the need for high processing power for their wearable devices is reduced. As a result, the types of IoT-based wearable devices they can incorporate into their services do not limit the healthcare network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a fog-IoT-based approach to secure data exchange from wearable IoT devices used for predictive healthcare services. We aim to improve the overall structure’s service integrity and flexibility. To further enhance the distributive organization of our network, we chose to use federated learning. With its ability to aggregate learning models, we can sort our data and keep private information secure. Also, it can reduce the sources of leakage since each client is only required to send their locally trained model to the server. Integrating federated learning improves the sustainability of the predictive healthcare service by providing a system that can organize the model data and provide a global model that represents the overall knowledge obtained through all the local training. The result is a scalable design that introduces flexibility by keeping the network distributed while ensuring that it does not impede the learning and analysis of the service.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we combine federated learning with private blockchain technology for more secure client authorization. Also, it is treated as a hyperledger to store the IDs of each client device and locally trained model. Due to its immutability, tracking and logging each trained model for version control and debugging improves the data analysis and learning aspect of healthcare networks and their services.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Commercial wearable devices are diverse. Some are low-end by design. To address this, we moved the process of locally training the model from the edge of the network to the fog. We can reallocate the training process by providing an intermediary fog device. Usually, training takes a large portion of processor capacity. Unfortunately, not every wearable IoT device can do it effectively. For our platform to be able and handle a diverse pool of wearable devices, we offloaded the processing required to a fog device.</p>

First, the fog device collects all sensed data from each wearable IoT device and trains the model locally. Each one sends its local model to the server for storage and tracking. Next, the server aggregates all the knowledge from the local models and generates a global model. Then, the server sends this model to each wearable IoT device through the fog nodes for further data analysis. We investigated the feasibility of our platform by simulating the intended data flow of our design and the effectiveness of our federated learning system. Lastly, our implementation aims to provide a low-cost setup that simulates our platform under a resource-constrained environment. We presented a top-down view of our architecture and its data flow. The following details will encompass the other design choices we made for further establishing the predictive healthcare service that our design models.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To establish the predictive healthcare service our platform will use to test its feasibility, we looked for a dataset and neural network configuration that fits our remote monitoring data flow. We chose a standard classifier design and organized the dataset to minimize its impact on our platform experiments. Our focus is on the effectiveness of our platform in securing wearable IoT device data and ensuring the integrity and flexibility of the healthcare service, and not maximizing the accuracy of the classifier. Therefore, the classifier we used in testing our platform is for human activity recognition (HAR). It uses accelerometer data from various commercial wearable IoT devices such as smartphones and smartwatches to determine the posture and condition of each user <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Healthcare services use these to monitor the safety of their patients. For example, it can detect the falling pattern of a person and enable real-time response. Also, they can monitor people’s daily exercise and regimen for further consultation and improvements for their health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Similarly, we will use it to simulate patient data for training HAR models to better reactive analysis and accident detection in wearable IoT device-based remote monitoring.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The dataset we selected is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. It is from an experiment with 30 volunteers within 19-48 years. Each individual performed six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying down. Each volunteer did each action wearing a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone on their waist. The result is a dataset that contains 10299 instances of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity captured from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the mobile device. It encompasses 561 labelled features with time and frequency domain variables. We chose this classifier and dataset combination because the data is from smartphones, which is more common to the public. This selection provides a better dataset scope that represents a larger population. Our focus is on the federated learning aspect of the design. We can minimize any impacts of extraneous variables that could interfere with our experiments and the precision of its results by using an already tested and documented classifier. Using it provides convenience and efficiency as we simulate the HAR-based predictive service testbed for our experiments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We implement a one-dimension convolutional neural network (CNN) because the dataset is a sequence with only a single-dimensional source. Also, it is a design that minimizes the overall processing requirement when training and testing the model. Since we aim for a low-cost approach, we intend to limit the impact of resource requirements. We coded it using a combination of the Keras and Tensorflow libraries in Python. The dataset was already pre-grouped to have a 70-30 split for training and testing. We use the same split when training and testing our CNN to avoid generating any significant impact from the nature of the classifier or the data. Also, we refrained from potentially over-tuning the CNN by only calibrating through the epoch number. We wanted to ensure that the experiments focused on the performance of the federated learning aspect of our design.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we extract the weights of each model and optimize them by scaling them according to the total number of clients and their accuracy. We optimized our weights by giving the model with the highest accuracy the best scaling factor and gave the rest lower scale values relative to the number of total fog clients in the network. This scaling scheme ensures that the best-performing local model is the base, and the rest are additional references for further learning reinforcement. While scaling, the server generates a CNN with the same layer design. Then, the script aggregates the optimized weights via averaging, takes the resulting solution, and sets it into the prepared model, which becomes the global model. This model encompasses all the knowledge obtained from each locally trained CNN. A graphical representation that shows the flow of our federated learning system is in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-C Federated Learning Implementation ‣ III Design and Methodology ‣ Federated Learning and Blockchain-enabled Fog-IoT Platform for Wearables in Predictive Healthcare" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We incorporated a private blockchain to manage the training information shared by the devices that will train the HAR-based predictive model. The blockchain protocols create an access level ensuring that only trusted devices can access the predictive model’s local training and global knowledge. We coded it in Python. Each block is a class definition that contains an ID, a list of training model results, and a hashed string of the previous block. The private blockchain authorizes communication between the server and the client based on their assigned ID. Also, it collects the locally trained models and stores them periodically within a block. These blocks are chained cryptographically by generating a hash of the previous block and storing it within the new one. The resulting data structure is a log of every training model sent to the server and the other actions the network carried out. The blockchain becomes a hyperledger that stores the history of every operation done by the network. Also, since it is tamper-proof, these records are protected. We also initialize copies of the blockchain and distribute them to each client to keep the data decentralized and free from manipulation outside the authorized devices. This distribution allows the service to check the validity of each client and the local models they are training and sending to the server.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the private blockchain, the information and operation within the network remain secure. Tampering becomes more difficult with the hyperledger keeping track of all the changes to the global model. It can record the results of each local training through the obtained models from the fog clients. Also, private and raw data from the clients are not sent to the server, keeping them secure from any form of leakage or malicious attacks. Overall, the blockchain sets up the network by securing its endpoints and reinforcing its decentralization.</p>

Our setup makes use of Raspberry Pi 3 Model Bs. We chose Pis due to their portability, programmability, and modularity for rapid programming. Also, we selected a low-cost and low-end device to simulate the capabilities of most wearable IoT devices. Each Pi has a Quad-core ARM Cortex A53 processor that runs on a benchmark of 1.2 GHz. Our focus is on model accuracy while processing speed is currently not a concern. We also used Pis for both the fog devices and the central server of our design. Each Pi is pre-loaded with a Raspbian-Jesse operating system. We installed Python 3.6 on every Pi as our programming language due to its flexibility and diverse selection of open-source labels. The selected version is the most recent version that works with all the Python libraries needed for our design. As for the wearable IoT device that represents the edge of our network, we based it on the same smartphones from the HAR dataset we chose to use. It is a Samsung Galaxy SII that uses a Dual-core 1.5 GHz Scorpion processor.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We structured our testbed to simulate data flow from the fog to the cloud server. It is to observe the behaviour of our platform under the standard network interactions of local and central servers of a fog-IoT network. In designing our testbed, we use low-cost and low-end devices to evaluate our design under minimal processing capabilities. We chose this approach to show the feasibility of our proposal when using simple IoT devices. It gives an estimate for a benchmark on the minimum system requirements for our implementation. We decided to use Raspberry Pi 3 Bs to model the fog devices because it is modular, portable, and low-cost. During the early stages of implementation, we discovered that the Pi could run the classifier training and the blockchain scripts without any issues. Therefore, we continued to use Pis as both the fog and the cloud servers in our network. Another reason why we chose to stay with just one type of technology was to limit the potential impact of any processing or data capacity advantage if we used a device with a better processor as a server. Since Pi’s are modular, we replicated each node by flashing an identical copy of the operating system to each device. As a result, we arranged the network to have a Pi as the cloud server with 10 Pis that serve as the fog nodes.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, we assume that each fog server already contains the wearable IoT device data, so the training and testing dataset is pre-loaded in each Pi. Since our focus is on the federated learning aspect carried out by the fog-IoT servers, we can skip the simulations of data transmissions between the wearable and the fog devices. Next, each fog device will train its models locally and send them to the central cloud server via wireless file transfer. The server will wait until it receives all the local models before the next step. Next, it will aggregate the weights of each model and scale it according to its accuracy. We implemented a scaling scheme that gives the highest possible scaling factor to the local model with the highest accuracy. At the same time, the rest of the models will receive the same scaling factor but are significantly lower. Then, the server will take the resulting scaled weights and set them on a structurally identical CNN, resulting in the global model. For our test, we plan to compare the accuracy of the global model with the average of the locally trained models from each fog device. We elected to use this metric to evaluate the behaviour of our platform. Also, we aim to ensure that our implemented federated learning system does not disrupt the integrity of the classifier. Finally, to investigate the security and adaptability of our design, we later discuss the strengths of our platform that we observed as we tested and simulated the platform.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, we trained the model locally using 10 Pis pre-loaded with the classifier and the dataset. We arranged the models by assigning a number to each corresponding client. The fog devices trained each local model using the same 70% split of the dataset. Also, we tested each model with the remaining 30% of the dataset. We tried to minimize the complexity of our classifier and focused on the performance of our federated learning system by doing the minimal tuning. The only parameters we tinkered with were the epoch number and the batch size, which we set to 10 and 8, respectively. The resulting model yielded a 90.43% testing accuracy. We generated its validation-to-training loss and accuracy plots as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Integrity Evaluation via Training Model Accuracy ‣ IV Results and Discussions ‣ Federated Learning and Blockchain-enabled Fog-IoT Platform for Wearables in Predictive Healthcare" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-B Integrity Evaluation via Training Model Accuracy ‣ IV Results and Discussions ‣ Federated Learning and Blockchain-enabled Fog-IoT Platform for Wearables in Predictive Healthcare" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, respectively.

This behaviour is due to the learning rate causing the trained model to be volatile at this point. Since the graph stabilizes, it does not significantly impact the overall model.

Based on the results, we can observe that as the number of clients increases, the accuracy of the global model keeps up and even eventually performs better than the average accuracy of its local models. Through this observation, we can see the ability of our implemented federated learning system to minimize any loss from aggregating weights. We can attribute this improvement in accuracy to our optimization scheme that assigns a higher scaling factor for the local model with the best performance.

Therefore, we can further reinforce the argument that our design can be scalable and efficient even under resource constraints. Since the Pis are modular and portable, our platform can cover remote monitoring applications constrained by distance and mobility. Overall, this shows the potential of our design as an effective and scalable approach that can benefit wearable IoT device-based predictive healthcare even with resource constraints.</p>

Since only the models are transmitted, limiting potential leakages protects the data of wearable IoT devices. With blockchains, our platform can create a more exclusive network where only trusted devices can send data to the cloud server. As a result, the hyperledger can reduce the endpoints that expose the server to malicious attacks such as spoofing and impersonation. Also, this can reduce the threat of Denial of Services (DoS) attacks. Since the blockchain can regulate which devices can actively communicate with the server, it can serve as a rate limiter for any targeted attack.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on our observations, our fog-based IoT architecture was able to aid in implementing both federated learning and blockchain technology with ease. We can attribute it to the decentralized structure of fog-IoT. Due to the fog architecture, both technologies can perform optimally under this network arrangement and utilize their strengths. Device diversity causes network strains due to the constant demand for updates and maintenance. However, federated learning reduces this strain by standardizing transmitted information into a uniform package. This package is the locally trained model. Lessening the demand for the cloud server to keep up with the latest wearable device allows it to focus on deploying services efficiently while keeping up with the most recent global knowledge. As long as the classifier structure remains uniform, the server only needs to regenerate the same model with different weights. As a result, the regeneration and aggregation become modular to the service. This modularity contributes to the adaptability of the network. It enables the use of other classifiers and wearable IoT device groups.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">With our experiments, the update time is each fog device’s training and communication time. We can observe in the testbed design that having a distributive arrangement can reduce the impact of the diversity of wearable IoT devices on the overall update time by offloading the training and processing to the fog. Instead of many wearable IoT devices that can yield varying update times, sending training data to the cloud server can be standardized. So theoretically, we can infer that our platform will result in a lower heterogeneity value. This analysis highlights the benefits of the distributive approach that we proposed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Also, the resulting accuracy of the global model presents how the precision of the predictive healthcare service is not affected by the shift in the location of the learning process. Since the edge device is only required to send data securely, it does not need standardization as long as the fog device is aware of the data it receives. Also, having one less complex process within a sensing device makes its design more robust. Removing this constraint helps the server keep up with the constant introduction of new wearable IoT devices by simplifying the data flow within the network. This change creates a more adaptable network that can cater to a diverse pool of wearable IoT devices.</p>

Another performance metric we can include for future iterations can be the propagation delay between the fog and the cloud when transporting the training model results. This addition introduces potential dynamic scenarios that further test the mobility and reach of our platform. Another metric could be the power consumption of the servers. The coverage of servers must reach remote areas in extreme cases of predictive healthcare. As a result, more portable and power-efficient designs are in demand for sustainability and longer service uptime. This design addition introduces the potential design and device optimizations that make the platform more cost-efficient while managing the predictive healthcare service. Another improvement is to test the platform with more than one neural network design and dataset.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a platform that addresses the issues of data privacy, service integrity, and network structure adaptability of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare. We used federated learning for its ability to effectively aggregate local models into a global entity to ensure the integrity of the predictive service. We further incorporated private blockchain technology to reinforce the overall network security. Lastly, we have fog-IoT as the base for offloading and process redistribution. By evaluating the implemented federated learning system in terms of model accuracy, we observed its feasibility in maintaining the integrity of the HAR classifier. Next, we discussed the effectiveness of our platform even when using a low-cost and low-end device as its fog and cloud server. Then, we analyzed our design choices and highlighted its strengths in terms of privacy preservation, security, and network adaptability. Overall, through our testing and evaluation, we saw the feasibility and potential of our proposed platform in addressing the security, integrity, and adaptive issues of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare.</p>
