<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In-home health monitoring has attracted great attention for the ageing population worldwide. With the abundant user health data accessed by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and recent development in machine learning, smart healthcare has seen many successful stories. However, existing approaches for in-home health monitoring do not pay sufficient attention to user data privacy and thus are far from being ready for large-scale practical deployment. In this paper, we propose FedHome, a novel cloud-edge based federated learning framework for in-home health monitoring, which learns a shared global model in the cloud from multiple homes at the network edges and achieves data privacy protection by keeping user data locally. To cope with the imbalanced and non-IID distribution inherent in user’s monitoring data, we design a generative convolutional autoencoder (GCAE), which aims to achieve accurate and personalized health monitoring by refining the model with a generated class-balanced dataset from user’s personal data. Besides, GCAE is lightweight to transfer between the cloud and edges, which is useful to reduce the communication cost of federated learning in FedHome. Extensive experiments based on realistic human activity recognition data traces corroborate that FedHome significantly outperforms existing widely-adopted methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With lower fertility and longer life expectancy, population ageing is becoming a global issue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world’s population aged 60 years and above will increase to 1.2 billion in 2025 and subsequently to 2 billion by 2050 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The ageing population tends to have a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, physical disabilities, mental illnesses and other co-morbidities, deriving problems such as shortage of medical resources and reduction of quality in healthcare services. Moreover, some older adults (e.g., solitary elderly, elderly couples) prefer to live independently in their own homes, bringing an increased risk of falls and strokes which could be life-threatening. Therefore, there is a growing demand for developing technologies that can aid in the care of the elderly from hospital-centric to home-centric. With the proliferation of smart devices, mobile networks and computing infrastructures, Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to make substantial advances in healthcare systems due to the integrated sensing, computation and communication capabilities of IoT devices. Thus, IoT-based in-home health monitoring is envisioned as a promising paradigm and has attracted great attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<figure id="S1.F1" class="ltx_figure"><img src="/html/2012.07450/assets/x1.png" id="S1.F1.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_landscape" width="433" height="162" alt="Refer to caption">
<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>In-home health monitoring. A large quantity of user data from smart healthcare IoT devices in multiple homes is collected to train machine learning (ML) models for in-home health monitoring and supportive healthcare services. As the user’s health data is privacy-sensitive, ML models can not be traditionally managed in a centralized manner.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">IoT devices, particularly wearable devices as exemplified by smartphones and smartwatches, can track a user’s activity, heart rate and so forth persistently, and then feedback these data to a healthcare center for further processing and diagnosis. Due to the easiness and low cost of people’s health information acquisition, smart in-home healthcare is able to facilitate pervasive and nonintrusive health monitoring, and is emerging as mainstream for smart healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Current healthcare applications often utilize machine learning (ML) models trained on massive user data to yield insights, perform in-home health monitoring and ultimately provide better public health services and products. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedHome: Cloud-Edge based Personalized Federated Learning for In-Home Health Monitoring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, one possible way is to collect a large quantity of training data required for a powerful in-home health monitoring system from many families. As users’ health data involves individual privacy, collecting and storing abundant health monitoring data at a remote cloud center to support data analytics based smart healthcare services would impose great privacy leakage risk, making people reluctant to adopt such services. At the same time, with the increasing concerns on data security and user privacy, several regulatory policies and protection mechanisms have been set to restrict data access and protect data privacy. For example, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), issued by the European Union, has enforced strict rules on data security and privacy protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Additionally, China and the United States have also strengthened their attention to data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Under the increasingly stringent data privacy protection legislation, it is almost impossible to integrate sufficient user health data scattered around multiple families for ML model training and in-home health monitoring.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Emerging wisdom to address the above privacy challenge in the traditional, centralized machine learning approaches is federated learning (FL) proposed by Google in 2016. FL enables jointly training a shared global machine learning model under the coordination of a central server by aggregating locally-computed updates while keeping all the sensitive data in local clients (e.g., smartphones), thus allowing users to collectively reap the benefits of the shared model without compromising their data privacy. This form of learning is ideal for community healthcare because it ensures privacy by default, respects data ownership, and maintains locality of data for application deployment at scale. Furthermore, federated learning makes all the participating clients (e.g., medical institutions, smart healthcare IoT devices) share their experiences with privacy guarantee, resulting in a significantly improved performance of the ML model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, existing studies of FL focus on training a single global model, which would suffer from the weaknesses in both statistical and communication perspectives and lacks personalization, resulting in a degraded performance in the healthcare scenarios. Firstly, since different users have different physical characteristics, the personally-generated data naturally exhibits the kind of non-IID (a.k.a. non-independent and identically distributed) distribution. Even for a single user, the health monitoring data can be highly skewed. For example, an adult’s activity data may include a lot of standing and walking samples, but very few falls. Both the imbalanced and non-IID distribution of user health data may greatly degrade the learning performance. Secondly, the communication challenge refers to communication constraints, such as slow or expensive connections and limited bandwidth costs. Existing federated learning approaches mainly focus on the communication rounds reduction considering the fact that mobile devices are frequently offline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, the communication overload reduction in each round is also critical to improve the efficiency of the algorithm considering the bandwidth cost. Finally, as for personalization, the shared model trained by federated learning only captures the common features of all users, but it may perform poorly on a particular user. Thus, it is necessary to learn the fine-grained information on a particular user for personalized healthcare. However, current federated learning researches in healthcare only focus on one of these challenges, without considering them as an interrelated integration. For example, Zhao et al. propose a data-sharing strategy to improve the FedAvg algorithm with non-IID by creating a small globally-shared dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Heong et al. advocate federated distillation to reduce the communication size to transfer in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Chen et al. propose a federated transfer learning framework for personalized healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To cope with above issues, we propose FedHome, a cloud-edge federated learning framework for personalized in-home health monitoring, which is a novel scheme that can simultaneously address the three challenges in a holistic manner. FedHome utilizes a synergistic cloud-edge computing architecture and federated learning to avoid uploading users’ sensitive data to a centralized cloud server, thus reducing the network latency, and more importantly, addressing privacy concerns. We devise a novel generative convolutional autoencoder (GCAE) network as the model trained on both the cloud and the edges. By integrating the parameter sharing mechanism in convolutional neural network (CNN) and representation ability of autoencoder (AE), GCAE is able to capture the representative and low-dimensional features of user data. Moreover, the representation ability of GCAE is improved together with the prediction ability through the model training process in federated settings. After global model training, GCAE generates new data samples of minority classes in low-dimension space with synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) in order to deal with the imbalanced and non-IID distribution exhibited in users’ health data. With the generated class-balanced dataset, the trained GCAE model can be personalized by fine-tuning its parameters for precise healthcare performance during classification or inference. It is worthnoting that GCAE plays a significant role in both training and personalization stages, thus resulting in an increased classification accuracy. Furthermore, GCAE is able to reduce communication overhead without compromising performance due to parameter sharing and autoencoder mechanism.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There have been some attempts that study healthcare in federated learning settings. For example, Silva et al. present a federated learning framework by investigating brain structural relationships across diseases and clinical cohorts without sharing individual information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Kim et al. convert massive electronic health records into meaningful phenotypes for data analysis by iteratively transferring secure summarized information of hospitals to a central server in federated settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Liu et al. develop a two-stage federated natural language processing method that enables utilization of clinical notes from different hospitals or clinics without moving the data and demonstrate its superior performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Besides, healthcare giants around the world — including the American College of Radiology (ACR), MGH and BWH Center for Clinical Data Science, and UCLA Health — are piloting FL in healthcare by bringing AI with privacy to hospitals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. For example, ACR uses FL to allow its medical imaging members to securely build, share and adapt ML models. Partners HealthCare, an integrated health system founded by Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, has also announced a new initiative using the NVIDIA Clara FL framework that will combine technical and clinical expertise with privacy preservation to deliver more robust AI algorithms for healthcare from hospital to home <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, in this paper we propose FedHome, a novel framework that aims to achieve accurate in-home health monitoring without compromising user data privacy by leveraging the merits of federated learning and edge computing. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedHome: Cloud-Edge based Personalized Federated Learning for In-Home Health Monitoring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, FedHome adopts a cloud-edge architecture for distributed data processing at users’ homes, achieves collaborative model training through federated learning and performs personalized model application with user’s local data. We elaborate these key elements in detail as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Cloud-Edge Architecture.</span> As elaborated above, purely cloud-based health monitoring would risk at the privacy leakage since it requires users to upload their sensitive health related monitoring data. On the other hand, in some emergency situations (e.g., fall detection for elderly people), the cloud-based approach could fail to respond in real time due to the significant network latency or interruption over the Internet. To address these issues, we promote a synergistic cloud-edge architecture to bring necessary on-demand edge computing power in the proximity of IoT devices. Therefore, each user can choose to process its local data on device, or offload its intensive model training tasks to the trustworthy edge nodes (e.g., edge gateway at home) for fast training. By leveraging federated learning, all users can merge their local models into a global model in the cloud for knowledge sharing without exposing their sensitive data. The trained model deployed locally at the edge can conduct inference much faster than in the cloud, and hence is useful for providing real-time healthcare services. Note that the cloud server here can be provided by some healthcare service company or can be a public server deployed collectively by the entire community of the home users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, as family members in the same home trust each other, they can share data and train a family-shared model at the trustworthy edge nodes, thus family members with insufficient private data can develop accurate local models by reaping the benefits from the data of their mutual-trusting family members.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning.</span> The federated learning (FL) procedure of FedHome mainly consists of the following three stages. Indicated by recent work that local models trained from different initial conditions would perform poorly in federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, we initialize the cloud model and then send the initial state to all clients (homes participated in FL) so that client models can be trained from the same random initialization. After receiving the global cloud model, each client model at the edge then performs local computation based on the global model and its local data, and sends the updated local model parameters to the cloud. Finally, the cloud server aggregates model updates submitted by participant clients and averages these updates into its global model. The process repeats until it converges after many rounds of iterations. Note that all these steps do no share any user data or information but the model parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Personalization.</span> The trained cloud model is based on generic datasets from dispersed homes, which may not well capture the specific characteristics of an individual target user. To perform personalized in-home health monitoring, each user can train a personalized model by integrating the trained global model and her personal health data. Nevertheless, as user’s personalized data is usually insufficient and high-skewed, there may be a significant distribution difference between user’s local data and the data population of all the participating clients, leading to large model weight divergence between user’s personalized model and the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Thus, directly retraining the cloud model based on user’s local data may result in an even worse model (e.g., degraded accuracy, overfitting with a few data samples) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To tackle this problem, the model trained in the cloud and the edges should be carefully designed. Specifically, we devise a generative convolutional autoencoder (GCAE) network to deal with the imbalanced class distribution of user’s health monitoring data. Besides, GCAE is suitable to be trained under federated learning as it is lightweighted and can reduce the communication cost between the cloud and the edges. The details of GCAE are elaborated in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Generative Convolutional Autoencoder ‣ 3 Learning algorithm for FedHome ‣ FedHome: Cloud-Edge based Personalized Federated Learning for In-Home Health Monitoring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>.</p>

Two primary ways to achieve this are outlined as follows: 1) increasing parallel clients participating in each communication round; and 2) increasing computation on each client by iterating the local update <math id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\omega^{k}\leftarrow\omega^{k}-\eta\nabla F_{k}(\omega^{k})" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.cmml"><msup id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">ω</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">k</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.2.cmml">←</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.cmml"><msup id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.2.cmml">ω</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.3.cmml">k</mi></msup><mo id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.2.cmml">−</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">η</mi><mo lspace="0.167em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.cmml"><mo rspace="0.167em" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.1.cmml">∇</mo><msub id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.2.cmml">F</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.cmml">k</mi></msub></mrow><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.2a" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><msup id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">ω</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1"><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.2">←</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.2">𝜔</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.3.3">𝑘</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1"><minus id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.2"></minus><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.2">𝜔</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.3.3">𝑘</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.2"></times><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.3">𝜂</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4"><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.1">∇</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.2">𝐹</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.4.2.3">𝑘</ci></apply></apply><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝜔</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p2.6.m2.1c">\omega^{k}\leftarrow\omega^{k}-\eta\nabla F_{k}(\omega^{k})</annotation></semantics></math>.

In this paper, we adopt FedAvg algorithm for cloud-edge collaborative training in FedHome. Note that, to further enhance the data privacy for the in-home health monitoring scenario, the above parameter exchange and gradient aggregation steps are done with homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which is a powerful tool to secure the learning process by computing on encrypted data and has been studied and adopted in FL settings. For example, Federated AI Technology Enabler (FATE) initiated by WeBank’s AI division is an open-source technical framework to support federated AI ecosystem that enables secure computing protocols based on homomorphic encryption (HE) and multi-party computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The learning process of FedHealth framework can leverage homomorphic encryption to avoid information leakage of model parameters during the learning process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To reduce the computational cost, more efficient variants of HE, such as additive HE, can be adopted in practical FL systems rather than fully homomorphic encryption which is computationally expensive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">After the global cloud model is learned, it can be directly applied to the homes at the edges for in-home health monitoring. However, it is obvious that the distribution of training samples for the cloud model is highly different from that generated by a single user, thus the cloud model fails in personalization. To make the model more tailored to a specific user, each edge client at home can train a personalized model by integrating the cloud model and the health monitoring data generated by its own users. Nevertheless, as user’s personalized data is usually insufficient and high-skewed, there may be a significant distribution difference between user’s local data and the data population of all the participating clients, leading to large model weight divergence between user’s personalized model and the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Thus, directly retraining the cloud model with user’s local data may result in an even worse model (e.g., slow convergence rate, degraded accuracy and overfitting with a few data samples) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To cope with this issue, we devise a generative model called GCAE under federated learning paradigm for better personalization, which is elaborated in the following.</p>

To deal with the imbalanced data distribution issue, we propose to learn a generative prediction model in both the cloud and the edges. More specifically, we devise a generative convolutional autoencoder (GCAE) that utilizes autoencoder (AE) as the backbone. AE aims to learn compact and effective feature representations of input values via an unsupervised learning schema by mapping the input to a latent space through encoder network and then mapping back to the original space using decoder network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. The learned feature representations are usually low-dimensional and contain all the information needed to recover the original inputs, and thus can be used as feature vector inputs to a supervised learning model (e.g., Multi-Layer Perceptron–MLP) for user health monitoring. It’s worthnoting that the feature representations, which are learned by compressing useful information of the local input data into low dimension by the encoder network of GCAE, are always learned and maintained by the local user without submitting to the cloud. And the cloud server only aggregates the model parameter updates obtained by performing local computations based on the global model and the local data of home users, without access to user’s sensitive data (e.g., data samples, low-dimensional feature representations), hence user’s privacy can be well protected in our FedHome framework. Besides, due to the fact that health monitoring data is mostly medical images and sensor records, we use convolutional neural network (CNN) as the main architecture for both encoder and the decoder. CNN is competent to extract features from signals and it has achieved promising results in image classification and speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the training process of FedHome, the cloud server managed by smart healthcare service provider first initializes the GCAE model and then sends the initialized model to all the participating clients (e.g., smartphones). Then, each IoT device user can offload its GCAE training task to the trustworthy edge (e.g., smart gateway or edge server) at home for fast computation. Finally, a global GCAE model can be well trained by leveraging model updates from multiple home edges under the coordination of the central cloud server in a cloud-edge architecture.</p>

When the learned GCAE model is deployed to the edge, we first conduct personalization to make the model more tailored to the edge users. However, the dataset generated by a single user may suffer from data imbalanced problem, which may heavily impact the model performance as a well-trained deep neural network usually relies on a class-balanced training dataset. One common way to tackle the issue of imbalanced data is over-sampling which aims to increase the number of instances from the underrepresented classes in the dataset.</p>

Thus, the dimension reduction ratio is 6 in our studying case. It is flexible to determine the dimension reduction ratio according to the specific healthcare applications. Then we adopt synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), one of the most commonly used oversampling methods, to generate a class-balanced dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

To well capture the health information and insights behind the data, it is often necessary to train a large neural network which has millions of parameters. However, in federated setting, a lightweight model is highly desirable in order to reduce the communication overhead during model parameter updates among the cloud and the edges.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Parameter sharing scheme is widely-used to reduce the number of training parameters. In our design, both the encoder and decoder networks of GCAE are convolutional neural networks (CNN) in which parameter sharing is used. More concretely, convolutional layer, the core building block of CNN, shares weights by all neurons in a particular feature map (the output received on convolving the image with a particular filter). Max-pooling layer, followed convolutional layer, is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation. However, purely adopting CNN will cause a lot of information loss and further lead to inaccurate health monitoring. With the autoencoder mechanism, the encoder network of GCAE is able to learn compact and representative feature vector of user’s health monitoring data via unsupervised scheme, ensuring that the low-dimensional input feature vector <math id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="e_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">e</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">ϕ</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><msub id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝐱</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.2"></times><apply id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑒</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.3">italic-ϕ</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝐱</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p8.1.m1.1c">e_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})</annotation></semantics></math> fed in prediction network is nearly lossless.

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To sum up, the holistic mechanism of FedHome is presented in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.2 Generative Convolutional Autoencoder ‣ 3 Learning algorithm for FedHome ‣ FedHome: Cloud-Edge based Personalized Federated Learning for In-Home Health Monitoring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, in which the edges train a globally shared GCAE model for in-home health monitoring under the coordination of a cloud server by leveraging federated learning. In each communication round, each edge uses the current cloud model as the initial model parameters in order to train its local model using its local user data, and then sends its local model parameters to the cloud (see Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 3.2 Generative Convolutional Autoencoder ‣ 3 Learning algorithm for FedHome ‣ FedHome: Cloud-Edge based Personalized Federated Learning for In-Home Health Monitoring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). This process repeats until the GCAE model on the cloud converges. Then, the trained GCAE model can be deployed in the edge server of each home. Each home user can further learn a personalized model by synthesizing a class-balanced dataset with her personal data and then refining model parameters with the generated dataset (see Algorithm <a href="#alg3" title="Algorithm 3 ‣ 3.2 Generative Convolutional Autoencoder ‣ 3 Learning algorithm for FedHome ‣ FedHome: Cloud-Edge based Personalized Federated Learning for In-Home Health Monitoring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). Note that this framework works continuously with the new emerging user data. In other words, FedHome is able to perform incremental learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. That is, when facing new user data, both cloud model and edge client models can be updated continuously. Moreover, the longer the user uses the healthcare application, the more personalized the client model can be. Besides, the learned cloud model, which captures the generic information of healthcare application users, can be easily deployed as a prior model to a new joining home that is new for the healthcare application and has almost no usage records.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The FedHome framework can also adopt other deep neural networks tailored to specific task, for example, recurrent neural networks for modeling Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) progression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, attention network for dementia status prediction from brain magnetic resonance imaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. This makes FedHome as a general framework flexible for supporting many privacy-preserving healthcare applications.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our study in this paper is based on a publicly accessible human activity recognition dataset called MobiAct <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. There are 57 volunteers (42 men and 15 women) within an age bracket of 20-47 years participating in the generation of MobiAct dataset. Each volunteer wears a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone with the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. The tri-axial linear accelerometer and angular velocity signals are recorded at a constant sampling frequency of 200Hz by the embedded sensors while volunteers perform predefined activities. The recorded activities can be divided into three types: (1) activities of daily living (ADL): the most common everyday activities like walking, standing, stairs up and stairs down; (2) fall-like activities which are sudden or rapid and are similar to falls, such as sitting on a chair or stepping in and out of a car; (3) falls, for example, fall forward from standing, fall backward while trying to sit on a chair, etc. Typically, there are four different types of falls as described in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ 3.2 Generative Convolutional Autoencoder ‣ 3 Learning algorithm for FedHome ‣ FedHome: Cloud-Edge based Personalized Federated Learning for In-Home Health Monitoring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. Note that this dataset can provide the relevant application scenario to mimic in-home health monitoring through human activity recognition (e.g., fall detection for elderly people).</p>

When the globally shared model is deployed on edges or user’s IoT devices, FedHome enables fast personalization (retraining with local data of a family or a user) and real-time inference (prediction with the input data by simply conducting matrix multiplications of the local neural network model).</p>

For each method, we compute the average and standard deviation of test accuracy by repeating the training and prediction processes five times. We can see that the test accuracies of all methods in balanced dataset are higher than those in imbalanced dataset. Moreover, the results show that deep learning based methods (MLP, CNN and GCAE) can all achieve a higher accuracy than traditional machine learning methods (SVM, KNN and RF) when the data samples of all clients are aggregated in a centralized location. This is due to the strong representation capability of deep neural networks. Besides, deep learning based methods can be updated and enhanced by incremental learning without retraining. This property is valuable in federated learning where model reuse is important and helpful because new data emerges continuously and the model should be quickly adapted to it. When adopting these deep learning methods in federated settings, the test accuracy decreases to some extent. For example, the test accuracy of FL-MLP under balanced data case is <math id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="3.03\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">3.03</mn><mo id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">3.03</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p3.1.m1.1c">3.03\%</annotation></semantics></math> smaller than that of MLP approach, this is mainly because of the non-IID nature of datasets generated by the users at different homes.

Although this method protects user privacy by keeping user data at the edge devices, it requires a large amount of data that are anonymized and integrated from users who would like to share their data in the cloud, which is impractical in real-world applications.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is first proposed by Google to solve the data island and user privacy problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. The key idea is to build machine learning models based on datasets distributed across multiple devices while preventing data leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. McMahan et al. introduce the <span id="S5.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FederatedAverage</span> (FedAvg) algorithm which has been verified to be robust and has been regarded as the fundamental framework in federated learning settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. While solving the problems of data island and privacy security, federated learning (FL) poses new challenges, such as imbalanced and highly-skewed data distribution and high communication cost. Thus, recent improvements have been focusing on overcoming these statistical and communication challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>. Zhao et al. propose a data-sharing strategy to improve FedAvg with non-IID by creating a small subset of data which is globally shared among clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. To reduce communication overhead, Jeong et al. propose federated distillation, a distributed knowledge distillation method whose communication payload size depends not on the model size but the output dimension <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Prior to operating federated distillation, the authors empower each participating device to locally reproduce the data samples of all devices so as to make the training dataset become IID by using a trained generative adversarial network. Nevertheless, this approach requires the user device to upload a few seed data samples to the server, which may put user privacy as risk. There are also some research efforts targeting at making federated learning more personalizable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. For example, the proposed FedHealth framework achieves personalized model learning for each organization through knowledge transfer while ignoring the fact that class imbalance problem will bring huge prediction errors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedHome, a novel cloud-edge federated learning framework for personalized in-home health monitoring, which achieves privacy protection by keeping user data locally. FedHome aggregates the data from multiple homes and trains a global model without compromising user privacy, and then achieves personalized model learning through knowledge transfer. To tackle the statistical and communication challenge inherent in federated learning, the cloud model to be learned is designed as a generative convolutional autoencoder (GCAE), which empowers to synthesize samples of minority classes and form a class-balanced dataset in personalization procedure to address the imbalanced and non-IID data dilemma. Moreover, GCAE consists only a small number of model parameters, and thus can significantly reduce the communication overhead during model transfer. Extensive experiments on human activity recognition have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both evaluation performance and communication efficiency. FedHome can be applied to many healthcare applications without incurring data leakage and can be a powerful approach for in-home health monitoring in the future.</p>
