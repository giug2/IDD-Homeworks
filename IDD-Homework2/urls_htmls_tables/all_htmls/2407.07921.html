<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">There is a significant demand for indoor localization technology in smart buildings, and the most promising solution in this field is using RF sensors and fingerprinting-based methods that employ machine learning models trained on crowd-sourced user data gathered from IoT devices. However, this raises security and privacy issues in practice. Some researchers propose to use federated learning to partially overcome privacy problems, but there still remain security concerns, e.g., single-point failure and malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework named DFLoc to achieve precise 3D localization tasks while considering the following two security concerns. Particularly, we design a specialized blockchain to decentralize the framework by distributing the tasks such as model distribution and aggregation which are handled by a central server to all clients in most previous works, to address the issue of the single-point failure for a reliable and accurate indoor localization system. Moreover, we introduce an updated model verification mechanism within the blockchain to alleviate the concern of malicious node attacks. Experimental results substantiate the framework’s capacity to deliver accurate 3D location predictions and its superior resistance to the impacts of single-point failure and malicious attacks when compared to conventional centralized federated learning systems.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, Location-Based Services (LBS) leverage the geographical data from IoT devices or users to provide tailored interaction services, significantly enhancing the IoT user experience, and are widely used in smart cities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. According to the application scenarios and requirements, it can be divided into outdoor and indoor localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Outdoor localization technologies, e.g., GPS, are adopted for driving and navigation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, owing to complex indoor environmental factors and the absence of GPS signals, these outdoor positioning technologies cannot produce satisfactory results in the indoor environment, especially in complex multi-floor smart buildings, which motivates the research on indoor positioning technology. Indoor localization technology utilizes radio frequency (RF) signals such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and locates the target using the received signal strength (RSS) that reflects the distance between the sensor and the user device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, leading to better performances in GPS-denied environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the field of RSS-based indoor localization, one of the most prominent solutions is based on fingerprints and machine learning models due to their higher accuracy and adaptability. The indoor positioning algorithm of the fingerprint-based methods typically involves two primary phases: offline training and online localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. During the offline training phase, a collection of reference points is conducted by gathering RSS measurements from known locations within the indoor environment. These reference points are utilized to construct a fingerprinting database. Subsequently, the localization models employ machine learning or even deep learning algorithms to establish a mapping between the signal fingerprints and their corresponding locations. In the online localization phase, the established localization models can determine the device’s position based on real-time RSS measurements.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In fingerprinting-based indoor localization systems, the training of the machine learning algorithm is conducted on a central server. The users of the localization service transmit their fingerprint data from the respective IoT devices to the central server. The central server engages in crowd-sourcing training data from users, trains a deep learning model, and provides indoor localization services, such as building floor classification (BFC) and latitude longitude regression (LLR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, such a framework raises several concerns in practice. Firstly, sharing location-linked fingerprint data collected locally with a central entity can raise privacy issues. More and more users prefer not to share the data directly in a central server. Secondly, the training and inference of machine learning algorithms rely solely on a central server, posing a single-point failure, a common security issue in centralized learning systems; when the central server fails, the entire system becomes non-functional until it’s restored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Thirdly, the system may be vulnerable to malicious attacks by dishonest clients through the injection of noisy data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the privacy concern, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> emerges as a promising solution, a machine learning technique that eliminates the need to transfer raw data from clients to the central server, mitigating privacy invasion. However, existing FL methods still suffer from security issues, e.g., single-point failure or malicious attacks. In fingerprinting-based indoor localization systems, single-point failure refers to the situation where the failure of the central server in the model training phase or implementation phase will cause the failure of the entire system. Malicious attacks entail the dispatch of nefarious clients by competitors or adversaries, disrupting the model training process by transmitting falsified or tainted data. On the one hand, as for single-point failure, opting for introducing decentralized technology to ease the over-reliance on the central server is a favorable solution. To this end, we introduce blockchain techniques due to their attributes of decentralization, traceability, and immutability. On the other hand, to counter malicious attacks, we design an update verification mechanism to differentiate between legitimate and malicious model updates, safeguarding our trained model from malicious alterations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, we propose a Decentralized Federated Learning framework for the AIoT location system (DFLoc), as shown in Fig.<a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ A Trustworthy AIoT-enabled Localization System via Federated Learning and Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
The DFLoc is a kind of the fingerprint-based localization system, which consists of several clients. These clients are randomly assigned one of three roles (worker, validator, miner) and engage in model aggregation over multiple iterations to train a location prediction model. This model comprises a classification network, denoted as DFLoc-BFC, and a regression network, referred to as DFLoc-LLR. The roles randomly assigned to the clients include local workers responsible for actual training, update validators tasked with verifying update quality and providing votes, and blockchain miners who aggregate vote results and client stakes and upload them onto the blockchain. At the end of each round, all devices, regardless of their previous roles, collectively aggregate model parameters whose received positive votes exceed the negative votes. This ensures that models suspected of poor quality or tampering are excluded from the model aggregation process. In the experimental part, we use WiFi data to validate the effectiveness of our proposed DFLoc system, since WiFi is one of the most prevalent methods in fingerprint-based indoor localization systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Within indoor environments, fingerprinting-based localization stands out as a favored choice, due to its ease of realization and remarkable accuracy. Implementing a fingerprint-based approach involves deploying several wireless sensors capable of acquiring RSS and creating a fingerprinting database, which consists of a set of reference points paired with the corresponding RSS values of the selected signal type for each reference point. Mainstream electronic devices used in daily life, such as laptops and IoT devices, all come with built-in WiFi capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Concurrently, existing WiFi access points can be used as reference points for signal collection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. These factors lead to WiFi as the most prevalent sensing technique for RSS fingerprint-based indoor localization. Some scholars apply centralized learning techniques as a means to address the challenge of WiFi fingerprinting-based indoor localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, all these centralized learning approaches have no longer been the preferred choices when considering personal information privacy and dynamic environment. On the contrary, FL is a more suitable solution for this problem due to the faster direct responses to newly measured data and the lower privacy loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Some FL methods are applied to the WiFi fingerprinting-based localization field. Nonetheless, these approaches encounter certain challenges. For instance, in their respective studies, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> focus solely on the issue of LLR within a limited 2D environment. While <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> tackles both BFC and LLR problems within a 3D environment, it simplifies the latter regression task to a discrete classification task, resulting in coarser location estimates. In response to the imperative of precise 3D indoor localization estimation, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> introduce FedLoc3D, a framework incorporating both classification and regression networks to resolve floor classification and longitude-latitude regression problems, respectively. The fusion of results from these two sub-networks yields accurate 3D coordinates. However, all of these works lack consideration of the concerns of single-point failure and malicious attacks. Inspired by their work, we design our sub-networks to enhance our approach and solve the security concerns mentioned above.</p>

Nevertheless, the implementation of federated learning may bring two significant problems, commonly referred to as single-point failure and malicious attack problems. On one hand, the single-point failure stems from an over-reliance on central servers for critical functions, such as local training aggregation. In the event of a central server malfunction, the entire system becomes vulnerable to complete disruption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional indoor localization systems that apply the centralized machine learning technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, all user data needs to be stored on the central server for training. When data is transmitted or stored on the server, risks of exposing the privacy of the data producers arise. Furthermore, this architecture’s heavy reliance on the central server may bring a single-point failure problem, which means if the central server fails, the entire system would lose its functionality. Moreover, it’s not reasonable to assume that all the clients are honest. The performance of traditional systems is very vulnerable to malicious attacks like uploading tampered data or local models. Thus, we propose DFLoc to solve the problems mentioned above.</p>

To tackle the classification and regression challenges in complex 3D scenes, such as smart buildings, we employ a dual-network approach. This approach involves the training of two distinct networks: DFLoc-BFC and DFLoc-LLR, each meticulously designed to tackle their respective specialized challenges. In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of the structures of both networks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the training phase of CFL, both servers and clients actively participate in the training process, server faults halt the entire system until the next round, while client faults result in parameter uploads with random values within the epoch. On the contrary, in the training phase of DFLoc, a faulty device during training, regardless of its role, is rendered inactive for the current round, due to its inability to pass signature checks during communication rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Within the inference phase of the CFL system, only the server remains active, and the outcome only depends on the server. Thus server faults during this phase result in a random output within the data range for the whole system. In contrast, in the inference phase of DFLoc, every client produces its respective outcome. Only malfunctioning devices generate random outputs, while the system takes into account each client’s output to derive the final output. As a result, some post-processing procedures, such as aggregating client results (sorting and computing the median) can be employed in DFLoc to mitigate the impact of faulty devices and derive an expected final result.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section investigates the impact of the single-point failure on the DFLoc-LLR during both the training and inference phases. Initially, experiments involving six schemes during the training phase are conducted: three for CFL and three for DFLoc, each with varying numbers of faulty devices in every training round. In Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3.1 The Robustness Against Single-Point Failure on DFLoc-LLR ‣ 4.3 The Robustness Against Single-Point Failure ‣ 4 Experiments and Simulation ‣ A Trustworthy AIoT-enabled Localization System via Federated Learning and Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we observe that all the curves denoting CFL schemes (blue, orange, and yellow curves) show fluctuations.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we analyze the inference phase of DFLoc-LLR through experiments conducted across four distinct groups, each corresponding to varying numbers of faulty devices in every round. Within each group, four schemes are assessed by the metric of error distance: CFL conducts the training phase only (blue bar), CFL conducts both training and inference phases (orange bar), and the same two schemes for DFLoc (yellow and purple bars). As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 4.3.1 The Robustness Against Single-Point Failure on DFLoc-LLR ‣ 4.3 The Robustness Against Single-Point Failure ‣ 4 Experiments and Simulation ‣ A Trustworthy AIoT-enabled Localization System via Federated Learning and Blockchain" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, when no faulty device is present, all four bars are identical. However, with an increasing number of faulty devices, rapid growth occurs in the first two values, while the latter two remain relatively stable. In a word, the DFLoc framework demonstrates robust resilience to the single-point failure in both phases, while traditional CFL systems are notably affected by such failures in these phases.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our framework is tailored for vast 3D scenes, including floor classification and latitude-longitude estimation. To accurately validate the overall performance of our DFLoc framework, we unify discrete building-floor indexes and continuous latitude-longitude values into a unified set of altitude, latitude, and longitude coordinates with consistent units. Since the UJIIndoorLoc dataset lacks explicit height data, we estimate height values based on floor information, assuming an average height of <math id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="6" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">6</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">6</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">6</annotation></semantics></math> meters per floor.
Consequently, the BFC model enables us to obtain the height value for any location point, while the LLR model provides latitude and longitude values. Through the standardization of output labels, we can effectively evaluate the performance of our proposed DFLoc framework in 3D scenes under malicious attacks and single-point failure.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, a novel framework named DFLoc is proposed to address the 3D indoor localization problem in large-scale and complex 3D indoor spaces, particularly under the challenges of malicious attacks and single-point failure. Within this framework, a decentralized federated learning approach is applied to train two networks: DFLoc-BFC and DFLoc-LLR, which provide accurate 3D position estimates based on RSS data. To bolster security and reliability, a model update validation mechanism and a decentralized architecture are incorporated into the federated learning process, effectively preventing the effects of malicious attacks and single-point failure. To better evaluate our DFLoc framework, we conduct extensive experiments using a real-world dataset of WiFi fingerprints. Our results demonstrate that DFLoc can effectively mitigate the challenges brought by malicious attacks and single-point failure in 3D environments when compared with the traditional central federated learning system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we will implement and evaluate DFLoc via real-world AIoT systems and blockchain data networks. Crowdsourced data will be collected from WiFi systems in smart buildings and subsequently annotated by users via a decentralized platform such as PublicAI. These labeled IoT data will be processed and stored on-chain within the Chainbase omni-chain data network. The localization functionality will be powered by the proposed DFLoc system, with location results translated into human-readable language by a crypto-native language model developed by Chainbase Inc. Through this approach, DFLoc aims to provide reliable data collection, annotation, and location-based services.</p>
