<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a promising distributed learning paradigm to support intelligent applications at the wireless edge, where a global model is trained iteratively through the collaboration of the edge devices without sharing their data. However, due to the relatively large communication cost between the devices and parameter server (PS), direct computing based on the information from the devices may not be resource efficient. This paper studies the joint communication and learning design for the over-the-air computation (AirComp)-based two-tier wireless FL scheme, where the lead devices first collect the local gradients from their nearby subordinate devices, and then send the merged results to the PS for the second round of aggregation. We establish a convergence result for the proposed scheme and derive the upper bound on the optimality gap between the expected and optimal global loss values. Next, based on the device distance and data importance, we propose a hierarchical clustering method to build the two-tier structure. Then, with only the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we formulate the optimality gap minimization problem and solve it by using an efficient alternating minimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline ones.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the proliferation of the mobile edge devices (such as smart phones, wearable devices, and sensors), a massive amount of data has been generated at the network edge<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The recent progresses in machine learning (ML) techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, fueled by the rich data, have the potential to enable a wide range of intelligence applications at the wireless edge networks, such as intelligent health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, conventional ML model training methods are conducted in a centralized fashion, which requires the central server to aggregate high volume raw data obtained at the edge devices and thus inevitably causes data privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Besides, collecting a large amount of raw data to implement the centralized learning methods in wireless scenarios inevitably consumes too much resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and thus it is hardly practical to be employed at the wireless edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> has been proposed as a promising distributed ML paradigm to protect the local data privacy and relieves the communication burden by allowing the edge devices to train the ML model locally and only upload their local gradients to the parameter server (PS) without sharing their data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the above advantages of FL, deploying FL in wireless scenarios requires a large number of high-dimensional gradients and global model exchanges between the PS and the edge devices, which still suffer from the communication bottleneck, especially for the case with large number of edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. To address this issue, over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique has been introduced to the wireless FL systems to support concurrently gradient uploading from the edge devices over the shared radio resources by exploiting the waveform-superposition nature of the wireless multiple access channels (MAC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Despite the advantages of reducing the communication latency and enhancing the scalability of the wireless FL systems, AirComp-based gradient aggregation suffers from the distortion caused by the additive noise and channel fading of the wireless channels, which significantly degrades the FL performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and comprehensive studies have been conducted to tackle this issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a joint device selection and receiver beamforming to maximize the number of the selected devices in each iteration under the mean square error (MSE) constraint for the aggregated signals. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed a joint transmit power and de-noising factor optimization method to minimize the per-iteration gradient aggregation error by taking the gradient statistic into account. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed the one-bit gradient quantization scheme at the transmitters and the AirComp majority-voting based decoding at the receiver, and analyzed the effect of noise, channel fading, and channel estimation errors on the FL performance in terms of convergence rate. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an optimal transmit power allocation to minimize the expected optimality gap of the wireless FL system for both the cases with biased and unbiased gradient aggregations. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a joint device selection and transmit power design to accelerate the convergence rate of the wireless FL system for both the convex and non-convex loss function cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The results shown in the above researches exhibit quite similar solutions to combat the negative effects of the additive noise and channel fading, where they discard the stragglers, i.e., the devices with relatively weak channel gains, due to the limited transmit power budget. However, discarding certain amount of devices during the training process may degrade the performance of the wireless FL systems due to the insufficient training data exploitation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Therefore, to fully exploit all the available data, one possible solution is to apply multi-tier computing techniques into the wireless FL systems, which is able to enhance the stragglers’ access probability to the PS and has been reported to show better learning performance compared to the conventional FL structure with direct communications between the devices and the PS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the authors studied the digital two-tier relay-assisted FL framework and proposed a partially synchronized parallel scheme to simultaneously transmit the gradients from the edge devices to relays and models from relays to the PS, which is able to reduce the training time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a two-tier relay-assisted AirComp-based wireless FL scheme, and optimized the transmit power coefficients at the devices and relays and the de-noising factors at the PS by minimizing the MSE of the aggregated signals with alternating minimization method. Instead of introducing additional relays, the authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a cluster-based two-tier wireless FL scheme based on the method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, where they select a set of devices as relays in each cluster to aggregate the gradients from the devices within the same cluster and the selected devices upload the aggregated gradients based on AirComp. The results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> numerically showed that the proposed scheme achieves comparable learning performance to the ideal FL system without channel fading and additive noise. However, the aforementioned works only considered device selection for the proposed scheme without providing any convergence analysis, power control, or clustering design for the proposed scheme. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors investigated the gradient sparsification and periodic averaging for the two-tier wireless FL system, where devices transmit the sparsified gradients to the associated small-cell base station (SBS) for intermediate model updates and the SBSs transmit the updated models to the macro based station (MBS) after several intermediate model updates. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the authors investigated a two-tier client-edge-cloud wireless FL system, where the devices upload the model parameters to the associated edge servers after multiple local updates and the edge servers upload the updated model parameters to the cloud server after several model aggregations. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> analyzed the convergence of the proposed two-tier FL scheme and revealed the impact of the number of the local updates and edge aggregations on the convergence. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the authors investigated the energy efficient resource allocation for a similar two-tier wireless FL systems as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, where the devices upload the gradients to the middle-tier aggregators and the middle-tier aggregators upload the aggregated gradients immediately to the top-tier aggregator. However, none of above works considered the joint communication and learning design, i.e., analytically characterizing the impact of communications on the learning performance, and some of them focus on only the communication aspect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and the others only for the learning aspect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>

It is observed that all the schemes converge after sufficiently larger number of iterations. When converges, the test accuracy of the proposed scheme is higher than those of the rest baseline schemes, while it performs close to the static clustering scheme. The reason why the proposed and static clustering schemes achieve close learning performance is that the data importance of the devices are quite close with i.i.d. data distribution. Hence, devices’ locations dominate the clustering objective when applying the hierarchical clustering method and the proposed clustering method is nearly static during the training process.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied the joint communication and learning design for an AirComp-based two-tier wireless FL scheme, where all devices are dynamically partitioned into different clusters across different training iterations and the PS aggregates the gradients from the devices through AirComp-based intra-cluster and inter-cluster gradient aggregations. First, we analyzed the convergence behavior of the proposed scheme and the optimality gap between the expected and optimal global loss values was derived under mild conditions. The optimality gap characterized the impact of the AirComp-based two-tier gradient aggregation errors on the convergence of the proposed scheme, which needs to be minimized to enhance the performance of the proposed scheme. To this end, we proposed the clustering method and studied optimality gap minimization problem. By jointly considering the device distance and data importance as the minimax linkage criterion, we proposed a low-complexity hierarchical clustering method that can be efficiently implemented during the training process. Then, with the instantaneous CSI and clustering result in each iteration, we formulated the optimality gap minimization problem under the individual transmit power constraint. To solve the optimization problem, we proposed an alternating minimization method, where the optimal solution for the subordinate devices follows regularized composite channel inversion structure. Finally, numerical results showed that our proposed scheme outperforms the baseline schemes.</p>
