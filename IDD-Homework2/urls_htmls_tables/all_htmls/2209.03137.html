<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Smart cars, smartphones, wearable devices and other devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), which usually have more than one sensors, produce multimodal data. Federated Learning supports collecting a wealth of multimodal data from different devices without sharing raw data. Transfer Learning methods help transfer knowledge from some devices to others. Federated Transfer Learning methods benefit both Federated Learning and Transfer Learning.</span></p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p"><span id="id2.id2.1" class="ltx_text">This newly proposed Federated Transfer Learning framework aims at connecting data islands and offering privacy guarantee. Our construction is based on Federated Learning and Transfer Learning. Compared with some previous Federated Transfer Learning, where each user should have data with identical modalities (either all unimodal or all multimodal), our new framework is more generic, because it allows a hybrid distribution of user data.</span></p>
<p id="id3.id3" class="ltx_p"><span id="id3.id3.1" class="ltx_text">The core strategy is to use two different but inherently connected training methods for our two types of users. Supervised Learning is adopted for users with only unimodal data (Type 1), while Self-Supervised Learning is applied to user with multimodal data (Type 2) for both the feature of each modality and the connection between them. This connection knowledge of Type 2 will help Type 1 in later stages of training.</span></p>
<p id="id4.id4" class="ltx_p"><span id="id4.id4.1" class="ltx_text">Training in the new framework can be divided in three steps.
In the first step, users who have data with the identical modalities are grouped together. For example, user with only sound signals are in group one, and those with only images are in group two, and users with multimodal data are in group three, and so on. In the second step, Federated Learning is executed within the groups, where Supervised Learning and Self-Supervised Learning are used depending on the group’s nature. Most of the Transfer Learning happens in the third step, where the related parts in the network obtained from the previous steps are aggregated (federated).</span></p>
<p id="id5.id5" class="ltx_p"><span id="id5.id5.1" class="ltx_text">To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework, we choose a
multimodal dataset with image (visual) and audio (auditory) modalities, and the goal of learning is scene classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework has better performance than the baselines. In addition, the framework shows high accuracy in the setting of Non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Compared with the baseline models, our framework has better performance. The accuracy of our framework can be up to 94.41% for image modality and 92.82% for audio modality, while the baseline models in Federated Learning without transferring can only achieve 93.68% for image and 88.16% for audio.</span></p>

<div id="Ch1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ch1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The introduction is to motivate the use of Federated Transfer Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite> with multimodal data, state the problems and list the main contributions.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1.1 </span>Motivation</h3>

<div id="Ch1.S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ch1.S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the real world, information often comes in different modalities. For example, we can describe one object with different modalities of data, e.g. images, videos, text, and voice. These multimodal data are obtained from different sensors and characterized by different statistical properties. Transfer Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> techniques can help represent information jointly, making the machine learning model capture the relevant knowledge between different modalities. However, the scope of sharing between different devices is limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1.S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ch1.S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, it is not easy to obtain multimodal data from different sensors, and some sensors only provide unimodal data. On the other hand, the rapid growth in the processing power of mobile devices inspires more and more data heavy applications, which usually face privacy risks. The strictest privacy and security law is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, that is enforced by the European Union on May 25, 2018. GDPR intends to protect users’ privacy and data security. As a result, there is an increasing need to store and process data locally. Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> can be used to aggregate the data from different participants with data privacy protection.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1.S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ch1.S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, we set up a new framework with unimodal and multimodal data. This framework combines Federated Learning and Transfer Learning methods, which enables participants with multimodal data to help participants with unimodal data.</p>

All the participants cannot communicate with each other directly due to privacy protection. Each participant holds only a small amount of data.

Next, we analyze related work of Federated Transfer Learning, Transfer Learning with multimodal data, and Self-Supervised Learning with multimodal data.
Then, in design chapter, we design a new Federated Transfer Learning framework for multimodal data.
After that, we implement the new designed Federated Transfer Learning framework, which use Contrastive Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> as a Transfer Learning strategy to learn transferable features. Besides, we implement the centralized approach with late fusion for unimodal and multimodal data as baselines, the effectiveness of which is viewed as a comparable group.
Finally, we evaluate the new designed Federated Transfer Learning in multimodal scene classification task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Besides, we compare the results of new designed Federated Transfer Learning framework with baseline models.</p>

<div id="Ch2.S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ch2.S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this thesis, we use scene classification to validate the feasibility of our proposal. Intuitively, scene classification is a task to answer the question: where am I? A typical example is to classify scenes in a video. The image-audio dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which is composed of 2-dimensional images (digital images) and 1-dimensional audio (acoustic signals), is a dataset with image-audio of multi-modality. The definitions of modality and multi-modality will be explained. The modalities of a video, i.e. image and audio, in scene classification will be elaborated, too.</p>

<p id="Ch2.S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Ch2.S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Multi-modality.</span> We humans can interact with the environment through touching, listening, seeing, etc. Similar to us humans, a machine interacts with an environment through different sensors, and each sensor can extract data like a human’s sense. The information achieved from one type of sensor is defined one modality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Note that one machine can have several types of sensors.
Then, the information collected by multiple sensors on the same machine, is defined multi-modality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. For example, a video is collected from only one single machine, which has two types of sensors, visual and acoustics sensor. Visual sensors produce visual modal data, image. Acoustics sensors produce acoustic data, audio.</p>

A digital image is formed by discrete picture elements called pixels. So each digital image is 2-dimensional array of pixels. Pixels, the minor units of the digital images, contain fixed values that describe any particular point’s color.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2.S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ch2.S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Ch2.S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Visual Sensor.</span> The two primary visual sensors are the charge-coupled device (CCD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Both of them are used in cameras.
However, CMOS has better performance than CCD, and offers advantages in lower system power, higher noise immunity, lower cost, and a smaller system size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. CMOS is widely used in smart phones and digital cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
We mainly model the CMOS sensor as follows. The CMOS sensor converts photons into voltages at the pixel site, which causes less sensitivity. The transistors near the pixels are used to measure and amplify the signal from the pixels. In these two processes, CMOS sensors have higher speed to produce pixels. In addition, a CMOS sensor consists of two-dimensional color filter arrays of blue (B), red (R),and green (G) pixels, i.e., the Bayer filter pattern, in which the active area of the G color filters is two times larger than that of the B and R color filters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>.
Perceiving the colors of the environment affects the reliability and accuracy, which in turn affects the related scene classification tasks. Particularly, RGB color-based cameras can lead to a significant performance improvement.</p>

Sound sensors work just like human ears, and they also have a diaphragm that detects sound waves by their intensity and converts vibrations into electrical signals. Each sound sensor contains an integrated condenser microphone, a peak detector, and an amplifier that is exceptionally attentive to sound <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite>. The specific measurement is usually carried out by calculating the amplitude of the sound in a fixed time interval.

The links within the source datasets are complementary, if the input source data represent various scenes and can be used to acquire global information, e.g. the information obtained by two cameras observing the same object from different fields of view is considered complementary. The relations in the source datasets are redundant, if large equal than two input source data supply details about the identical object and can be merged to increase the confidence, e.g. data from overlapping regions are conclude as redundant. The relationship between the source datasets is cooperative, if the supplied features are merged as a new feature which is often more complicated than the original features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

Specifically, pretext tasks use convolutional layers based models to extract features from input data. The learned models are treated as pre-trained models. Moreover, these models are usually be used for the downstream tasks, for example, image classification, image segmentation, object detection, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In addition, these tasks can be used for almost any type of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. The frequently used pretexts based on different applied scenarios can be divided into four variants: color transformation, geometric transformation, context-based tasks, and cross-modal based tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="Ch2.S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Most pretext tasks focus on learning the invariance of colors in images, when color converting techniques are used in color transformation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In geometric transformation, pretext tasks mainly focus on learning similarity under spatial transformations of the images, which include flipping, scaling, cropping, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Context-based tasks include jigsaw puzzle, frame order based tasks and future prediction. Jigsaw puzzle tasks aim to rearrange the scrambled patches of an image with an encoder. Frame order based tasks deal with time series data, for example a video. Future prediction is to do the future prediction from a past sequential data. In cross-modal based tasks (view prediction), encoder models from different modalities simultaneously learn the similarity of feature representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. For example, video based data features of the corresponding data streams like RGB image frame and audio sequence (see Figures <a href="#Ch2.F3" title="Figure 2.3 ‣ 2.3 Supervised Learning and Self-Supervised Learning ‣ Chapter 2 Background ‣ Master Thesis: Federated Transfer Learning with Multimodal Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>). Besides, the constraint of image and audio modalities provide auxiliary information about the contentment of videos. Overall, the critical purpose is to force the model to maintain the invariance to transformations and keep distinctions to other data points.</p>

The self-learned pretext models serve as pre-trained models. Then, pre-trained models are fine-tuned by any visual downstream tasks include image classification, image segmentation, pose estimation, .etc. In other words, the evaluation of Self-Supervised Learning is to assess its performance on transferring perspective, which is in a high-level to prove the generalization power of the pre-trained models. Thus, the evaluation performs over the implementation of general Supervised Learning with fine-tuning. Our framework needs only the first phase of self-supervision to achieve the representations.</p>

Federated Learning is a collaborative learning paradigm that allows many participants (e.g. mobile devices) to learn a model in parallel without sharing raw data, while a central server controls the aggregation of various participant models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.</p>

Difficulty like network unavailability in edge computing equipment may prevent industries from merging datasets from different sources, which makes each data source like an island. Even when the data source can only communicate at a specific time, Federated Learning helps to access heterogeneous data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Federated Learning supplies real time continual learning. Federated Learning uses participants’ data to continuously improve the model, without the need to aggregate data for continuous learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>. Federated Learning offers hardware efficiency. Federated Learning uses less complex hardware, because Federated Learning has no need of central server to analyze data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>.

<span id="Ch2.S4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Horizontal Federated Learning.</span> Horizontal Federated Learning or sample-based Federated Learning utilizes datasets with the identical feature space but different sample space on all devices, which means that participant A and participant B have the identical features.
<span id="Ch2.S4.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Vertical Federated Learning.</span> Vertical Federated Learning or feature-based Federated Learning utilizes different datasets with different feature space but identical sample space in order to train a global model. For example, participant A has information about the customer’s jewellery and clothing purchases, and participant B has information about the customer’s comments and reviews of jewellery and clothing, utilizing these two datasets from two different fields, participant B is enable to serve the customers better using comments and reviews of clothing to provide better clothing recommendation to the customers searching clothes in participant A.
<span id="Ch2.S4.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Transfer Learning.</span> Federated Transfer Learning utilizes different datasets which are not only different in sample space but also in feature space.

<p id="Ch2.S5.p14.1" class="ltx_p">Especially, Transfer Learning is beneficial to image field. Digital medical image is a helpful technique for computer-aided diagnosis. Medical images are difficult to collect and their quantity is limited because medical data are generated by special techniques (e.g. X-ray radiography). Therefore, Transfer Learning can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic tool. There are many successful applications. Maqsood <span id="Ch2.S5.p14.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. use Transfer Learning technique to detect Alzheimer’s disease by fine-tuning AlexNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. The proposed approach gets the highest accuracy rate in the experiments of Alzheimer’s stage detection. For this Alzheimer’s stage, the medical images (MRI) is preprocessed by using a contrast stretching operation in the target domain. Next, the AlexNet architecture is pre-trained (source domain) as the start of learning new tasks. Then, the last three layers (one softmax layer, one fully connected layer, and one output layer) of AlexNet is replaced, but the previous convolutional layers are reserved. At last, the fine-tuned training on Alzheimer’s dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> in the target domain is carried out using the modified AlexNet.</p>

The paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> can provide us direction to avoid negative transfer, and the most important tool is task clustering.
The similar tasks should be gathered using task clustering techniques, when data is clustered regarding to task models. Moreover, the learning tasks can be split into different groups. Each group of tasks is relevant to a low-dimensional feature, and different groups hold different low-dimensional features.

Besides, homomorphic encryption approach is applied as a additional to preserve the local data privacy of social computing participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>. Experimental results are shown that a feasible but not ideal performance is obtained by the framework in the social computing field <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>.</p>

Image steganography is the method of concealing secret information within images. Conversely, image steganalysis is a counter method to image steganography. This method intends to detect the secret information within images. Through this detection technique, the steganographic features which are generated by image steganographic methods can be extracted. However, there are still problems that exist in image steganalysis. Image steganalysis algorithms train on machine learning models which rely on a large amount of data. However, it is hard to aggregate all the steganographic images to a global cloud server.
Moreover, the users do not want unrelated people to snoop on confidential information. To solve the problems, Yang <span id="Ch3.S1.p11.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. propose the framework called FedSteg. FedSteg trains a machine learning model with a privacy-protecting technique through domain adaptation. Domain adaptation is used to train the local model by decreasing the domain discrepancy between the global server and local data. Compared with traditional non-federated steganalysis techniques, the experiment results show that FedSteg achieves certain improvements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>.</p>

Wearable devices allow people to get access to and record healthcare information. Additionally, smart wearable devices use a large amount of personal data to train machine learning models. Different wearable devices have diverse characteristics and domains. However, the healthcare data from different people with diverse monitoring patterns are difficult to aggregate together to generate robust results. Each personal data is an island. Besides, the machine models using personal data are hard to train on cloud servers. To solve data isolation and locally training problem, Chen <span id="Ch3.S1.p12.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. proposed a Federated Learning framework called FedHealth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In this paper, the authors used a neural network (NN), which has two convolutional layers, two pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. NN aims at extracting low-level features. Domain adaptation is applied to transfer the extracted features from server to clients by minimizing the feature distance between server and clients. Compared to the approaches without Federated Learning and traditional methods (KNN, SVM, and RF), FedHealth achieves better performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems are mainly to identify the users’ consciousness from the brain states. Deep learning methods achieve success in the BCI field for classification of EEG signals. However, the success is restricted to the lack of a large amount of data. Besides, according to the privacy of personal EEG data, it is constrained to build a collection of big BCI dataset. In order to solve the lack of data and the private privacy problems, Ju <span id="Ch3.S1.p13.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. proposed a Federated Transfer Learning method for EEG Signal classification. They propose an method which use Transfer Learning technique with domain adaptation to extract the common discriminative information, and map the common discriminative information into a spatial covariance matrix, then subsequently fed the spatial covariance matrix to a deep learning based Federated Transfer Learning architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. The proposed architecture based on deep learning has 4 layers, namely Manifold reduction layer (M), Common embedded space (C), Tangent projection layer (T) and Federated layer (F), the middle two layers (M and T) provide the functionality of Transfer Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.

Concretely, the authors in FedMD focus on the differences of local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. The authors in FedMD identify that communication is the key to fix model heterogeneity. Devices should have the ability to learn the communication protocol to leverage Transfer Learning and model distillation. The communication protocol aims to reuse the models, which are trained from a public dataset. Each client achieves a well-trained model, and applies the well-trained model on local data which is considered as Transfer Learning with model distillation. Thus, the proposed FedMD, which combines Federated Learning and Transfer Learning with knowledge distillation, allows participants to create their models locally, and a communication protocol that utilizes the power of Transfer Learning with model distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.

This module has two important operations squeeze and excitation, mainly for the channel level, and it is not sensitive to spatial information. There is the size of feature map here, because the channel information is aimed at the features of a channel, which will be condensed into a little information. Besides, this component MMTM can be flexibly added in two modal information layers. So it does not affect the initialization of each modal. This module can be applied in, for example, sign language recognition, action recognition, speech enhancement (one of which is to use mouth shape to suppress the influence of surrounding noise to enhance the speaker’s voice), etc.</p>

Instead of using two sub-networks, two embedding level based encoders are used to extract features. More sepecific, Audio with a alternative of 1 second and centralized on the corresponding selected frame, is viewed as a positive pair modalities, otherwise a negative pair is drawn from different videos. This is different from previous method AVC, in which a concatenation based non-linear multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used for the two embedding features and decides whether the signals are related. The decision distance is also measured through a contrastive loss, which is Euclidean distance based loss. Similarities between embedding level based representations are performed explicitly in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, rather than represented features are learned implicitly in a fused MLP in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.

This method is different from learning the contrastive visual-audio of diverse samples. LWTNet is to solve these three challenges: (i) there are many visually similar but sound different generating objects in a scene (multiple people speak together), and the model must correctly identify the sound to the actual sound source; (ii) these to-be-identified objects may change their position over time; and (iii) there can be multiple other objects in the scene (clutter) as well. More concretely, synchronization cues are measured for each frame by aggregating local scores on each pixel. A maximum spatial response is calculated for cues of each video frame. This spatial response creates the result of a attention map.

Different Transfer Learning methods (e.g. use pre-trained model) are used as components and transfer knowledge successfully in Federated Learning. However, in Federated Learning, we can not make sure that each the participant holds a pre-trained model, and domain adaptation has the risk of negative transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>. Multimodal Transfer Learning approaches provide the possibility of knowledge transferring between different modalities. However, early and late fusion can suppress either intra-or inter-modality interactions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite>, which indicate directly combine two modalities in domain adaptation may cause problems for Transfer Learning. Self-Supervision methods make different modalities connect closely during training, meanwhile the trained multimodal feature can do better knowledge transferring.

Domain adaptation approach in Federated Transfer Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> give us a direction that all participants can learn a common discriminative information to do better transferring.

<p id="Ch4.S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We choose Contrastive Learning as our Transfer Learning strategy. From the related work of Contrastive Learning, AVC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is the first paper using Contrastive Learning with an image-audio dataset. AVC applies contrastive loss to learn <span id="Ch4.S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">matching</span> between different modalities. The contrastive loss of AVC is similar as it in SimCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which is calculated after fusing different modalities. AVE-Net <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> goes one step further based on AVC. This step is embedding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which is used to extract features after fusing. However, the authors in CrossCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite> analyzed that the embeddings ignore the inter-similarities between modalities. Thus, we choose the contrastive loss function in SimCLR to learn representative features from multimodal data.

In order to verify the entire design, it is necessary to ensure that the baseline models are reproducible and that there is no significant deviation from the corresponding testing accuracy. We also need to apply Federated Learning in baseline models to verify the basic effectiveness. Furthermore, considering the non-IID setting may affect the performance of Federated Transfer Learning, experiments are required. Finally, it is crucial to improve performance while protecting privacy.</p>

The multimodal dataset as well as baselines models should satisfy following the requirements: (1) each sample of the multimodal dataset has two or more overlapping features, and the modalities do not affect each other; (2) both unimodal and multimodal models must be used for the same classification tasks; (3) multimodal data can be co-trained with two or more unimodal data.</p>

<p id="Ch5.S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, the data distribution of participants is also an issue that needs to be explored. For example, the data distribution is usually IID. However, in the real world, it is non-IID, e.g. participants hold different amounts of data or only hold data for one category. Thus, it needs to explore how the non-IID setting affects Federated Transfer Learning framework performance.</p>

The dataset consists of videos from 9 different environments. In total, 45 video sources have been processed, and they are at 29.97 frames per second and then reduced to 2000 seconds. Each frame (at 0.5s, 1.5s, 2.5s … and so on) of a video is extracted as a image, at the same time, each MFCC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> audio statistic is also extracted from corresponding second of video. These 9 environmental classes are in the table <a href="#Ch5.T1" title="Table 5.1 ‣ 5.1 Design Decisions ‣ Chapter 5 Implementation ‣ Master Thesis: Federated Transfer Learning with Multimodal Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>. All the videos are captured in the nature environment. In order to make better distinction between different classes and obtain better recognition results, it is necessary to crop the image at each second to obtain the initial data objects. As it is shown in Figure <a href="#Ch5.F1" title="Figure 5.1 ‣ 5.1 Design Decisions ‣ Chapter 5 Implementation ‣ Master Thesis: Federated Transfer Learning with Multimodal Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>, each frame of video and each piece of audio are extracted in pairs. Thus, 32,000 recognizable objects and 17,252 RGB images pairwise with 17,252 seconds of audio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

We set up 30 participants, each holding 13800/30=460 samples. All the participants have similar distribution with the whole training dataset. In total, we set 100 global epochs for global models.

The values are computed from averaging the results of three trained models with randomized initialization. We divide 90 participants into 3 groups, 30 for image modality as group 1, 30 for audio modality as group 2, and 30 for image-audio modality as group 3, each participant of each modality has 13800/30=460 samples. The data samples in all participants are randomly assigned with 460 sample, and the total number of samples owned by a group is always 13800.

In this experiment, we still divide 90 participants into 3 groups, 30 for image modality as group 1, 30 for audio modality as group 2, and 30 for image-audio modality as group 3. We then assign an index to each participant from 1 to 30 in each group. For the participants hold the same index, we give the same number of samples, with the limit that the total number of samples owned by each group is always 13800. For example, after we initialize the framework, if a participant with index 1 in group 1 has 470 samples, then the participant with index 1 group 2 must have 470 samples, and participant with index 1 in group 3 must also have 470 samples.
The data samples in all participants are randomly assigned. This assignment is an independent sampling without replacement. In total, we set 100 global epochs for global models.</p>

The training losses of image and audio modalities remain unchanged with a jitter at 0.15 after 20 global epochs, while the validation of those remains stable with small jitters at 0.4.
For image-audio multi-modality (Contrastive Learning), training loss dramatically decreases in 40 global epochs. Moreover, it remains unchanged with small jitters after 60 global epochs, while the validation is smoother after 40 global epochs.
In addition, all training and validation accuracies increase dramatically in 10 global epochs and remain stable with slight jitter after 40 global epochs. From 20 to 100 global epochs, the validation accuracy of the image is always higher than the audio (Figure <a href="#Ch6.F17" title="Figure 6.17 ‣ 6.3.4 New Design with Unbalanced Distribution \@slowromancapi@. ‣ 6.3 Evaluation Results ‣ Chapter 6 Evaluation ‣ Master Thesis: Federated Transfer Learning with Multimodal Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.17</span></a>).</p>

<div id="Ch6.S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ch6.S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our new Federated Transfer Learning framework is applied to multimodal data, where some participants hold a part of data with multi-modality, and the others hold a part of data with only uni-modality. The goal of our framework is that participants have a part of data with multi-modality help the others have a part of data with uni-modality, and it can protect all participants’ privacy.
Because data in the real world are usually non-IID, and non-IID brings often low performance. To confirm our framework in the real world, we apply our framework to different non-IID settings.
More specifically, our framework has better performance than the implemented baseline models with Federated Learning. Besides, our framework prevails even when the participants hold a part of data with non-IID distribution, i.e., performs better than Federated Learning with only unimodal data. In addition, when all the participants hold the same portion of data, the testing accuracy of each uni-modality will be close to each other. If there are many participants in one particular scene <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, for example, restaurant and grocery-store often achieve low correctness. The experiments confirms that in our framework participants with multimodal data help participants with only unimodal data, which means that participants with multimodal data transfer knowledge to participants with unimodal data.</p>

<div id="Ch7.S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Ch7.S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data are collected from different devices (participants) using different types (modalities) of sensors. These participants hold a part of data either with multi-modality or only uni-modality. Besides, these participants can not connect directly with each other because of privacy issues. Thus, the problems is how the participants with multimodal data can transfer knowledge to others with only unimodal data.
In this thesis, our new Federated Transfer Learning framework, which combines Federated Learning and Transfer Learning, can solve the above problem. Federated Learning is used to train models from different participants locally with privacy protection. We use the contrastive Learning as the Transfer Learning strategy, which learns transferable representations from participants with multimodal to help participants with unimodal data.
