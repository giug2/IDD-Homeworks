<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">To preserve the data privacy, the federated learning (FL) paradigm emerges in which clients only expose model gradients rather than original data for conducting model training. To enhance the protection of model gradients in FL, differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is proposed which incorporates differentially private (DP) noises to obfuscate gradients before they are exposed. Yet, an essential but largely overlooked problem in DPFL is the heterogeneity of clients’ privacy requirement, which can vary significantly between clients and extremely complicates the client selection problem in DPFL. In other words, both the data quality and the influence of DP noises should be taken into account when selecting clients. To address this problem, we conduct convergence analysis of DPFL under heterogeneous privacy, a generic client selection strategy, popular DP mechanisms and convex loss. Based on convergence analysis, we formulate the client selection problem to minimize the value of loss function in DPFL with heterogeneous privacy, which is a convex optimization problem and can be solved efficiently. Accordingly, we propose the DPFL-BCS (biased client selection) algorithm. The extensive experiment results with real datasets under both convex and non-convex loss functions indicate that DPFL-BCS can remarkably improve model utility compared with the SOTA baselines.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Artificial intelligence empowered by machine learning has achieved an unprecedented success.
However, the advancement of machine learning gives rise to concerns on data privacy infringement because training complex machine learning models heavily relies on data extensively collected from clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. As reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, user privacy can be easily inferred from collected data. To preserve data privacy during model training, the federated learning (FL) paradigm emerges, in which clients only exchange their model gradients rather than original data with a parameter server (PS) for multiple global iterations to complete model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, exposing model gradients is still susceptible to malicious attacks. As investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, if model gradients are excessively exposed to attackers, FL clients may suffer from membership inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. To defend against these attacks, differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is proposed which injects noises generated by differentially private (DP) mechanisms to distort gradients before their exposure. Although DP noises can protect clients from external attackers, the biggest challenge of DPFL lies in significantly compromised model utility due to the disturbance of DP noises. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, model accuracy can be lowered by more than 40% by straightly injecting DP noises, making intelligent services useless. Significant efforts have been dedicated to improving DPFL model utility from various perspectives, such as adaptively allocating noises for each iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, probabilistically exposing large magnitude gradients for each iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, optimizing the number of total exposure times <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and designing a personalized data transformation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that the privacy requirements among clients are inherently heterogeneous in all aforementioned works, in which clients can set noise scales according to their own requirement, <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, none of these works take this privacy heterogeneity into account when optimizing DPFL. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the privacy requirement heterogeneity is rooted from the following fact. An altruistic and cooperative client inclines to add small noises, while a selfish and conservative client inclines to add large noises.
Thereby, it is likely that noise scales of different clients have a giant discrepancy. Currently, there exists very limited works discussing the importance of this problem but only attempting to solve it from a heuristic perspective. Aldaghri <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> studied the heterogeneous differential privacy in federated linear
regression and proposed to tune aggregation weights of clients based on their privacy budgets. Liu <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed to extract the top singular subspace of the model updates uploaded by clients with more privacy budgets to project model updates from clients with small privacy budgets before the PS aggregates them.
Due to their heuristic design, these works without theoretical guarantees are probably far away from the optimal solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenge, we optimize the strategy to select clients in DPFL according to heterogeneous privacy requirements among clients with theoretical guarantees.
Intuitively speaking, a dedicatedly designed client selection strategy should select clients with small noises more frequently and vice verse in case that DPFL performance is impaired by large noises. Inspired by this intuition, we propose a biased client selection framework for DPFL (which is more generic than unbiased client selection widely adopted in previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>) so that client selection can be flexibly adjusted in accordance with heterogeneous differential privacy among FL clients. Then, convergence analysis of DPFL is conducted to quantify the influence of heterogeneous differential privacy and biased client selection on model utility under standard DP mechanisms (<em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, Gaussian <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and Laplace mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>) and convex loss. Based on convergence analysis, we formulate the problem to minimize the loss function with respect to the selection probability of each client. We prove that this is a convex optimization problem and further explore how to solve this problem efficiently and accurately in practical systems. Inspired by our analysis, the DPFL-BCS (biased client selection) algorithm is designed, which can be deployed on a semi-honest-but-curious PS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

There are three clients with heterogeneous data samples and distinct privacy requirements. In this example, the noise scale is small on Client 1, but is much bigger on Clients 2 and 3. From the data distribution perspective, Client 3 owns the most number of samples while the data distribution of Client 2 is closest to the distribution of all data among all clients which is called IID. In this example, a random client selection strategy cannot discriminate values of different clients suggesting that we should at least consider: 1) The noise scale, <em id="S2.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, the smallest noise scale on Client 1 will reduce the disturbance of noise; 2) The number of data samples, <em id="S2.SS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, Client 3 owns the most number of data samples, which is vital to FL; 3) The data sample distribution, <em id="S2.SS2.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, the IID data distribution on Client 2 is favored for the convergence of FL. This example indicates that client selection is non-trivial in DPFL with heterogeneous privacy. It is subject to both the noise scale and the data quality. The problem will be much more complicated when considering the entire FL process with multiple rounds.</p>

In our study, we suppose that each client honestly reports its privacy budget to the PS, which is the same as scenarios studied by most related works such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, it is possible that clients refuse to report their privacy budget information in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Based on recent studies, we briefly discuss how DPFL-BCS can overcome this deficiency.</p>

The further processing of the Lending Club dataset is the same as that in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. We set the interest rates of loans per annum as the label of each record while others are used as features. We remove unique identifier features, such as IDs and member IDs. Features with the value of “NULL” are removed as well before we encode categorical features. After that, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to further select top ten important features as our training features.
Finally, we regularize each selected feature, which is conducive to the stability of the training model.</p>

allocate the local dataset and sample the privacy budget for each client. The privacy budget is then fixed when comparing different algorithms. The training results are plotted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-C Discussion ‣ IV Optimizing Client Selection ‣ The Power of Bias: Optimizing Client Selection in Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Differential Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> with upper subfigures showing results with Gaussian mechanism and lower subfigures showing results with Laplace mechanism. In each figure, the x-axis represents the number of conducted global iterations while the y-axis represents the model utility evaluated by the test set retained by the PS. From these results, we can observe that: 1) DPFL-BCS achieves the highest model utility compared with other DP based FL algorithms. Its performance is the one closest to FedSGD which does not involve DP noises to protect gradients; 2) Compared to Gaussian mechanism, Laplace mechanism compromises model utility more significantly, which however can provide a stronger privacy protection; 3) Although our theoretical analysis is based on convex loss, experimental results indicate that DPFL-BCS is effective under both convex and non-convex loss functions; 4) PFA and WeiAvg outperform DPSGD and DMLDP because they have considered privacy heterogeneity in their design. Yet, their performance is still much worse than ours because they are heuristic based; 5) PRIVATEFL outperforms DPSGD with Gaussian noises because it can reduce data heterogeneity among clients to improve the utility. However, PRIVATEFL fails to improve the performance of DMLDP with Laplace noises, and even achieves worse performance on CIFAR-10. Besides, its performance is always worse than ours in each experimental case because it does not take privacy heterogeneity into account.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FL framework was originally proposed to protect data privacy when training machine learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> is the first one devising model average algorithms, <em id="S6.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, FedAvg and FedSGD, for FL, which allows decentralized clients to only exchange model parameters (or gradients) with the PS to complete model training. The data privacy is preserved since clients never expose their raw data to the PS. Later on, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> analyzed the convergence of FedAvg/FedSGD under non-IID data distribution. To accelerate the convergence of FL, different variants of FedAvg/FedSGD have been proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> with theoretical guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Owing to its privacy protection capability, FL has been widely used in privacy sensitive applications, such as digital health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and smart cities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, as reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, FL is still susceptible to two kinds of malicious attacks: model performance attacks and data privacy attacks. The objective of model performance attacks is to demolish FL training to yield a final model with poor performance.
For example, a data poisoning attack was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> that can attack FL by flipping data labels on clients. Then, a more advanced attack algorithm was designed by using gradient ascent to fine-tune the global model and increase its loss on unseen data.
Our study focuses on the second kind of attacks which attempt to infer data privacy from leaked model information.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, a white-box inference attack was developed that processes extracted gradient features from different layers of
the target model separately, and combines their information to compute the membership probability of a target data point.

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to defend against data privacy attacks targeting for model gradients in machine learning (ML), DP mechanisms were introduced, which distort private information with zero-mean random noises. Wu <em id="S6.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> incorporated Laplace mechanism into distributed ML to protect the exposed gradients.
Nonetheless, its model utility was severely compromised by DP noises since noises are straightly injected.

However, these works were not designed for FL, and thus did not consider non-IID data distribution.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Later on, the adoption of DP mechanisms has been extended for DPFL, and efforts were made to alleviate the noise influence on model utility.

Considering that the noise scale is proportional to the exposed model size, compressive sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and privately gradient selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> techniques were introduced into DPFL by reducing the number of exposed parameters. Zhou <em id="S6.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed to optimize the numbers of model exposure times to reduce the influence of DP noises. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> incorporated DP into the popular SCAFFOLD algorithm, which is a variant of FedSGD, by taking data heterogeneity into account. Furthermore, PRIVATEFL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> was proposed to reduce the client heterogeneity introduced by both data and DP noises through a carefully designed personalized transformation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, aforementioned works did not consider privacy heterogeneity among DPFL clients. In reality, DPFL clients set privacy budgets based their own privacy requirement, and thereby the discrepancy of noise scales between different clients is probably significant.

Then, Liu <em id="S6.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>
proposed the WeiAvg algorithm that uses the ratio of privacy as aggregate weights to mitigate the influence from clients with large noises, but this heuristic design failed to optimize model utility.
Based on WeiAvg, the PFA algorithm was proposed which divides selected clients into two sets: “public” and “private” in each global iteration based on their privacy budgets. Then, it extracts the top singular subspace of model updates submitted by “public” clients to project model updates of “private” clients before aggregating them with the ratio of privacy. The computational complexity of PFA is prohibitive in practice, proportional to model dimension and client population. Its memory overhead is also significant proportional to the square of model dimension.
In contrast, our design is based on convergence analysis, in which the client selection problem under heterogeneous privacy is formulated into a convex optimization problem. Thus, our design is lightweight and guarantees optimized model utility in comparison to PFA.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is the most popular technique for data privacy preservation in model training. Differentially private has been widely incorporated into FL to enhance the protection level. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous privacy requirement on FL clients will compromise their data values to different extents, which has not been well addressed by existing works. To fill in this gap, we analyze the convergence of FL with DP noises to quantify the influence of DP noises on model utility. Based on convergence analysis, we optimize the client selection strategy that can properly incorporate each client into FL based on its noise scale so that the final model utility is maximized. Moreover, our design is lightweight incurring negligible overhead. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our design can significantly improve model utility compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. Although our initial work proves the effectiveness of DPFL-BCS,
in the future work, we will explore how to extend our design under more complicated scenarios such as online FL and decentralized FL systems.</p>
