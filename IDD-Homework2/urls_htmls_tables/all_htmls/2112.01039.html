<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a transformative paradigm that jointly train a model with distributed data sets in IoT while avoiding the need for central data collection. Due to the limited observation range, such data sets can only reflect local information, which limits the quality of trained models. In practice, the global information and local observations would require a joint consideration for learning to make a reasonable policy. However, in horizontal FL, the central agency only acts as a model aggregator without utilizing its global observation to further improve the model. This could significantly degrade the performance in some missions such as traffic flow prediction in network systems, where the global information may enhance the accuracy. Meanwhile, the global feature may not be directly transmitted to agents for data security. How to utilize the global observation residing in the central agency while protecting its safety thus rises up as an important problem in FL. In this paper, we develop a vertical-horizontal federated learning (VHFL) process, where the global feature is shared with the agents in a procedure similar to that of vertical FL without any extra communication rounds. By considering the delay and packet loss, we will analyze VHFL convergence and validate its performance by experiments. It is shown that the proposed VHFL could enhance the accuracy compared with horizontal FL while still protecting the security of global data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Nowadays, big data is typically collected from distributed facilities or agents. Due to limitation on the network capacity and data security, however, it is hard to process data for central analysis. Therefore, distributed learning rises up as an important issue for data analysis in large-scale networks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed Horizontal federated learning (HFL) which jointly trains a model among distributed clients through local training and model aggregation. In this process, the clients’ models are periodically trained based on previously aggregated models until convergence. Such a learning scheme allows applications to collectively reap the benefits of shared models trained from the rich data while avoiding the need of central data collection. That is, the trained FL model could assist the policy decision in IoT applications with a wider learned experience while protecting the security of the original agents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the combined experience from distributed agents will largely improve the performance, it is still not enough if the global observation is not taken advantage of. Also and since the agents in IoT rarely work independently, correlations among them is unavoidable, which stresses the importance of global information in policy decision. For instance, the network trafic flow in one community will also affect its neighborhood. The self-driving performance may count on the positions and directions of neighboring cars. Such information typically resides in a central agency. Hence, if we can properly use such global observation in federated training, then the learned model will definitely give a better policy. Therefore, to improve FL for intelligent decisions among clients, how to utilize the global observation in the training procedure is a critical issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Integrating the global feature into horizontal FL faces many practical challenges in network system. Since the security may be threatened if the global observations are broadcast, the central agency often needs to keep its global data from being directly accessed by distributed clients. Therefore, the processing of global features should reside at the center. In this context and compared with conventional HFL, the central agency should announce its processed results other than just aggregating the model weights. Multiple challenging questions will thus need to be addressed. These include: How should we design such an FL mode to integrate a global processing? How can we jointly train the federated model and the global model with communication-efficient interactions? Does the joint training converges and what are the factors which can influence the convergence? In this paper, we will try to answer these important questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning (VFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is a modified scheme for cases in which the data sets share the same sample ID space but differ in the feature space. For instance, a commercial company and a bank may seperately record the related features of many users in a city. Combining these features in training will largely enhance the model accuracy. To deal with the security problem, VFL is designed to securely aggregate the varied features and compute the training loss and gradients to build a model with data from both companies collaboratively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The training procedure of VFL provides a way to aggregate features from different agents. To integrate the global feature into HFL, the central agency could view the federal clients as another companion. In this sense, combining VFL into horizontal federated training provides a natural way for the central agency to share the global feature in security. It is known that the center in HFL only acts as a model aggregator. Under the concept of VFL, we will add a global model at the center to process the globally observed features. The processed results will be broadcast to distributed clients together with the aggregated model weights. When the local training is completed, the resulting loss for the global model will also be uploaded together with the updated weights of the local models. In this procedure, the extra transmissions are included in the periodic model aggregation and broadcast as in HFL. Since the processing results and feedback loss are rather small compared with the model weights, the system could naturally ensure communication efficiency. In this paper, we will propose a Vertical-Horizontal Federated Learning (VHFL) scheme and design the collaborative training procedure therein. Through theoretical analysis, we will prove its convergence considering the background packet loss and transmission delay in the networking system. Based on the network data among distributed communities, we will also test the convergence of VHFL and verify its performance. Hence, for IoT applications counting on global observations, it will be a practical scheme for distributed learning.</p>

For vertically partitioned data in distributed clients, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> introduced the VFL scheme with privacy preserving. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the authors discussed the concept of federated transfer learning (FTL) for scenarios where two datasets differ both in the samples and feature spaces. This mode is specifically fit for scenarios where the united data sets among clients are very limited for FL. The training mode of FL is challenged by the heterogeneity among clients. Thus, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed the FedProx framework that allows each participating client to perform a variety amount of local training to achieve a more robust convergence. With the same aim, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> tried to apply an adaptive optimizer on the model updates in FL. To cope with the non-i.i.d. data sets among clients, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> presented clustered FL (CFL) which exploits the geometric properties of the FL loss surface to group the client population into clusters with jointly trainable data distributions. By counting on the client set for solution, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> tried to maintain a control variate to correct the client-drift in its local updates.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Assuming that the clients intend to train a model for policy making in local applications, then they will need the combined experience from other clients and the central agency. Samples of other clients could enrich the model training with improved accuracy. Meanwhile, the global feature contains observations of the whole system, which is often crucial for policy decisions. Here comes the major problem. Hence how the clients and central agency could train a model collaboratively without transmitting their data sets is a critical question. Other questions include: Could the training ensure a convergence in the network system? Considering the network connection, how should we implement the joint training considering unreliable communication?</p>

Meanwhile, the global observations typically contain sensitive information of the whole system. Spreading the global data around clients could seriously threaten the security.
Thus, the center will also train a model to process the global information and share the results with clients for prediction. In VHFL, the clients will jointly train in the HFL mode. In this process, the center will not only aggregate the model weights as in HFL, but also train its own global model to assist the HFL among clients with global information.

In this section, considering the non-i.i.d. data distribution among clients, we will analyze the convergence of VHFL in the convex and non-convex cases. Beforehand, the basic assumptions from the literature and the non-i.i.d. metric for data distribution will be first introduced. Then the convergence bound will be derived and discussed in detail.</p>

However, due to the random flow burden and link conditions, the network is typically unreliable. For services of VHFL, the packet loss and delay in network transmission will degrade the model aggregation. Note that the TCP will retransmit the lost packets, which results in a larger delay. In this case, the packet loss condition can be covered by increasing the network delay.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We test the VHFL on the flow data in a practical network among a range of communities. The target is to predict the network throughput of each cell. In this case, the cells are the distributed clients with observations from the local flow records. Meanwhile, the central flow data reflecting the features of several neighboring cells are stored by the central agency as the global feature. Each data sample is a vector composed of features from the flow records. The data features are composed of the typical network parameter settings involving the average user trafic, average and maximum number of active users, small packet ratio, etc. Assisted by the central counterparts, the features among distributed cells form the distributed data sets for FL. The samples in all cells and the central counterparts are divided into a training set and test set. The training loss and the inference test accuracy are recorded in each training mode.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to properties of the data features, we employ a multilayer perceptron model (MLP) in the experiments. In distributed cells, the local features are first processed by an MLP model. Then the output feature is concatenated with the globally processed feature and processed by a subsequent MLP model to predict the throughput. At the central agency, a similar MLP model is applied to process the global observations. The results are shared with the local counterparts and concatenated in the local model.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In future 6G communication, the intelligence assisted by distributed learning will be a major engine to assist the IoT applications. From the networking perpestive, how to share the experience while protecting the data security should be an important consideration. The proposal of FL addressed the problem of sharing experience among distributed clients. However, how to combine the central information in distributed training still remains to be solved. For security concern, the global data in the network center can not be directly broadcast. However, if we can utilize such information without direct data transmission, the obtained intelligence will be significantly enhanced.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we discussed how to introduce the use of global observations in FL. By combining the training procedure of vertical and horizontal FL, we developed a collaborative training method called Vertical-Horizontal Federated learning (VHFL) where a central agency can train a model to process the global observations. Through theoretical analysis, we developed an analytic bound for the VHFL training loss and showed that the central model will converge with the federal model and achieve a similar convergence rate as conventional HFL. Considering the practical implementation of VHFL, we discussed the effects of network delay and proposed the theoretical principle to schedule the waiting time in model collection. Finally, extensive experimental results were used to validated the effectiveness and convergence of VHFL and were shown to fit well with the theoretical results. In practical network, VHFL can be applied to applications where the global information is effective for distributed intelligent clients.</p>
