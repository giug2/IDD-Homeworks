<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we review recent progress towards understanding the nature of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma.
We review the theory necessary to understand the melting of bound states due to color-screening,
including lattice results for the heavy quark potential, lattice results on the correlation functions related to the relevant spectral functions,
and the emergence of a complex-valued potential in high-temperature quantum chromodynamics.
We close with a brief survey of phenomenological models of quarkonium suppression in relativistic heavy ion collisions.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The theory of strong interactions describes the fundamental force responsible for the stability of nuclei and the particles that themselves constitute nuclear matter, e.g. the proton, neutron, etc. The theory describes the interaction and properties of the most elementary constituents of matter currently known: quarks and gluons. The quantum theory which describes the interaction of color-charge carrying quarks and gluons is called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD predicts that when the temperature of nuclear matter is increased above a certain threshold, strongly interacting matter undergoes a phase transition to a “new” state of matter referred to as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Through this phase transition the degrees of freedom change from color-neutral hadrons to color-charged partons which are no longer confined to exist only inside color-neutral hadrons. We note that calling this phase of matter “new” QGP is somewhat of a misnomer, since it is thought to be one of the oldest forms of matter in the universe, presumably present a millionth of a second after the birth of the universe in the Big Bang. QCD predicts that in the high temperature deconfined QGP phase, the interactions between quarks is color-screened much like electric charge is screened in an electromagnetic plasma. In addition, the QGP is also characterized by the restoration of a fundamental QCD symmetry, which is broken at low temperatures, called chiral symmetry.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to non-linearities present in QCD there is as of yet no comprehensive analytic understanding of the theory. For difficult non-perturbative questions, of which there are many in QCD, practitioners instead utilize numerical calculations of the QCD partition function on discrete lattices called lattice QCD. As a result there are several supercomputer centers around the world utilizing state-of-the-art computational resources in order to aid our understanding of fundamental questions in QCD. As mentioned, lattice QCD is a quite reliable tool particularly for addressing the non-perturbative aspects of QCD. The phase transition itself is highly non-perturbative and, in the immediate vicinity of the transition, one cannot rely on weak-coupling perturbation theory techniques written solely in terms of either hadronic or quark and gluon degrees of freedom. Many modern finite temperature lattice QCD results have achieved a high-degree of precision and the results obtained are consistent between different groups using a variety of lattice discretization methods. Unfortunately, the determination of a precise transition temperature is impossible since, as we will discuss below, the QCD phase transition is a smooth crossover and not a sharp first or second order phase transition.</p>

This deviation is well-described by resummed weak-coupling QCD calculations, indicating that at these temperatures partonic degrees of freedom in the form of quark and gluon quasiparticles are the relevant degrees of freedom. At such temperatures it is clear that color-electric screening becomes relevant.

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Since the 1970’s quarkonia, which are bound states of heavy flavor quarks (charm or bottom) and their antiquarks, have had an essential role in testing QCD, especially at zero temperature. Since the seminal work of Tetsuo Matsui and Helmut Satz in 1986<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the behavior of quarkonia in high-temperature QCD has been considered a tell-tale signal for deconfinement and QGP production in heavy ion collisions. The original idea behind this proposal was that color screening in a deconfined plasma would reduce the binding of quarks, and thus prohibit the formation of heavy quark bound states. This “melting” of quarkonia in the QGP would manifest itself in the suppression of the quarkonia yields relative to the production without a QGP formation. Quarkonium melting at high temperature has been often quoted to be the QGP thermometer (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Quarkonia in the Quark Gluon Plasma" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> for a cartoon rendition of the idea), serving as an essential tool to measure the plasma temperature. Various states with different masses have different sizes and thus are expected to be screened and dissociate in the QGP at different temperatures.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As we discuss in detail in this review, the existence and the dissociation of quarkonia in the hot QGP medium is far from being this simple. The three leading complications are that (i) there are more than just color screening effects affecting the binding of a particular state in the QGP (there is for instance Landau damping), (ii) there exists a poorly understood non-perturbative intermediate temperature region just above the chiral critical transition (the aforementioned domain <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="160-300~{}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">160</mn><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">300</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1"><minus id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.1"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.2">160</cn><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.3">300</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">160-300~{}</annotation></semantics></math>MeV) where identifying the relevant degrees of freedom, and thus their relevance for quarkonia must be carefully considered, and (iii) there exist purely nuclear initial state effects, collectively called cold nuclear matter effects (e.g. nuclear absorption, parton energy loss, and modifications of the parton distribution function), which must also be accounted for.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">During the last two decades, quarkonia in a finite temperature medium have been studied using lattice QCD, but the results, more precisely the interpretation of the results, have not been without controversy. Effects of the hot medium are imprinted on the spectral function, the quantity which contains all the information in a given heavy quark-antiquark channel. Therefore, in principle, determining spectral functions at different temperatures should give us insight into the effects of a QGP on the bound states. For instance, the disappearance of a well-defined peak into the background of continuum states would be a clear indication for the melting of a state. This allows us to define what is referred to as a dissociation temperature (as we discuss below, we would like to draw attention to inconsistencies in the literature in how dissociation temperatures are precisely defined). In this review we discuss state-of-the-art lattice QCD results relevant for in-medium quarkonium properties, including screening and time- and space-like heavy meson correlation functions. Both of these are directly connected to the spectral functions that we seek and enable a determination of the static quark-antiquark interaction potential. We also briefly review what we have learned about quarkonia from these results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The formation, behavior, and modification of the properties of the quarkonia has also been addressed in phenomenological models, commonly referred to as potential models. We would like to highlight though, that the semantics is somewhat misleading, because potential models need not rely on phenomenological constructions of the heavy quark interaction potential, as was done in early studies. The potential can be derived directly from the QCD Lagrangian. At zero temperature, this was accomplished some time ago already. In recent years, finite temperature field theory derivations of the real part and, the previously ignored, imaginary part of the heavy quark potential have been completed. We will refer to these QCD-derived approaches as potential models even, and discuss them in more detail below. There are currently limitations to what questions such potential results can answer, making other phenomenological models necessary. Therefore, when educated guesses for the potential (based on high temperature QCD, and/or lattice QCD results for the free energy) are used to analyze quarkonia at finite temperature, or dynamical modeling is utilized to bridge from static spectral functions to their dynamical evolution in a cooling and expanding medium, we refer to these as phenomenological models.</p>

Understanding the wealth of experimental results requires understanding the medium modification of quarkonia and disentangling hot- and cold-matter effects.

Since space for this review is limited and these studies fall outside the immediate area of expertise of all three authors, we don’t discuss them further in this review; however, we are encouraged that there may be an additional non-perturbative method for addressing the behavior of quarkonia in the quark gluon plasma.</p>

The effects of the medium are encoded in the boundary conditions on the gluon and quark
fields: gluon fields obey periodic boundary conditions, while quark fields obey anti-periodic
boundary conditions.
This formalism is commonly known as the imaginary time formalism. Dynamical properties
of hot strongly interacting matter can be obtained from time-dependent correlation functions.
In the imaginary time formalism one can calculate correlation functions along the imaginary time axis.
These can be related to real time correlation functions by analytic continuation. However, in
many cases it is simpler to formulate the problem directly in real time. This can be done using
the real time formulation of thermal QCD, in which the time runs in the complex plane, first
along the real axis then coming back from infinity to <math id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="-i/T" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mo id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1a" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mrow id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml">i</mi><mo id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.1" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.1.cmml">/</mo><mi id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml">T</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1"><minus id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1"></minus><apply id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2"><divide id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.1"></divide><ci id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.2">𝑖</ci><ci id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.3">𝑇</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p1.3.m3.1c">-i/T</annotation></semantics></math> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

Unfortunately, lattice methods cannot be used in the real time

a challenging problem. Still, our current understanding of QCD thermodynamics is largely
based on lattice results. In particular, our knowledge of the QCD equation of state, the

the QCD medium to external static chromo-electric fields, all come from lattice QCD calculations.

In addition to the equation of state, fluctuations of conserved charges have also been calculated in lattice QCD.
At low temperatures, massive hadrons are the carriers of different conserved charges and, therefore, the fluctuations
of conserved charges are suppressed by the corresponding Boltzmann factors. In fact, at low temperatures,

The center symmetry is broken by the presence of dynamical quarks, and as we discuss in the next section, for physical values of the
light quark masses it is not a good symmetry. Therefore, for QCD a deconfinement transition temperature, that is similar to the deconfining transition in pure gauge theory, cannot be
defined.</p>

The expectation value of the Polyakov loop is zero in the confined phase and non-zero above
the transition temperature. The qualitative change in the behavior of the Polyakov loop and its correlator above the phase transition
temperature is related to color screening.
The correlation function
of the Polyakov loop is related to the free energy of a static quark anti-quark pair <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

cancellation of the singlet and octet contributions at leading order.
For a long time it was not clear how to generalize
the decomposition of the free energy into the singlet and octet contributions beyond
leading order. Recently, using the effective theory approach that will be discussed below,
it was shown that this decomposition indeed holds at short distances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
As we will see below, the singlet free energy turns out to be rather
useful when studying screening numerically in lattice calculations.</p>

For
a quasi-particle in the medium, one obtains a smeared peak, with the width
being the thermal width.
As one increases the temperature, the width increases and at sufficiently high temperatures, the contribution from the meson state in the spectral function may be sufficiently broad, and thus it is no longer meaningful to speak of it as a well-defined state.</p>

It turned out, however, that the above conclusion
was premature: As we discuss below, quarkonium correlators are not particularly sensitive to modifications in the spectral function due to the dissolution of the quarkonium bound states. Detailed systematic studies revealed that with more realistic priors in the MEM analysis there is no indication of the existence of the bound states <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> (for the discussion of MEM systematics also see Ref. <span id="S2.SS3.p5.2.4" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\refcite</span>Wetzorke:2001dk).</p>

It was found that in the pseudoscalar
channel this ratio stays close to one, showing only small temperature-dependence.
This result seemed to support the early conclusion based on the spectral functions extracted from MEM, that

was observed. This was interpreted as melting of 1P charmonium states and fit well into
the expected picture of sequential melting. However, as already mentioned above,
this conclusion was premature. In the deconfined phase there is an additional contribution to the spectral functions
at very low frequency. This can be seen by calculating the spectral function in the free theory, where a contribution proportional to

For large quark mass the transport peak is narrow and is well-separated
from the high energy part of the spectral function, which corresponds to bound states and/or unbound heavy quark anti-quark
pairs (continuum). One expects a similar structure in the spectral function in other channels as well.</p>

also provides
information about the temperature-dependence of the spectral function.
Unlike the temporal correlators, spatial correlators can be calculated
for arbitrarily large separation and, therefore, can be more sensitive to in-medium
modification of quarkonium spectral functions.
Medium effects are expected to be the largest at distances which are larger than <math id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1/T" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mi id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.3.cmml">T</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1"><divide id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.1"></divide><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.2">1</cn><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1.1.3">𝑇</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m1.1c">1/T</annotation></semantics></math>.

Therefore, a detailed study of spatial meson correlators
and screening masses can provide some information about the melting of meson states at high
temperatures.
Spatial meson correlators and screening masses have been calculated in the light hadron sector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>
and for charmonium <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>.
The changes in the correlators and screening masses around the transition
temperature are much smaller for quarkonia than for the light mesons. This fits into the picture that ground state
of charmonium does not melt at the crossover temperature.

One can generalize this approach to finite temperature. However, the presence of additional
scales makes the analysis more complicated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. The effective Lagrangian will have the same form as above,
but the matching coefficients may be temperature-dependent. In the weak coupling regime there are three different thermal scales:

When the binding energy is larger than the temperature the
derivation of pNRQCD proceeds
in the same way as at zero temperature and there are no medium modifications of
the heavy quark potential <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>.
But bound state
properties will be affected by the medium through interactions with ultra-soft gluons. In particular,
the binding energy will be reduced
and a finite thermal width will appear due to medium-induced singlet-octet transitions arising from the dipole interactions in
the pNRQCD Lagrangian <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite> (c.f. Eq. (<a href="#S2.E27" title="In 2.4 Effective Field Theory Approach ‣ 2 Theoretical Methods ‣ Quarkonia in the Quark Gluon Plasma" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">27</span></a>)).
When the binding energy is smaller than one of the thermal scales, the singlet
and octet potential will be temperature-dependent and will acquire an imaginary part <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>.
The imaginary part of the potential arises because of the singlet-octet transitions induced by the dipole vertex as well as
due to the Landau damping in the plasma, i.e. scattering of the gluons with space-like momentum off the thermal excitations in

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">At increasingly high temperates quarkonium binding energies are significantly reduced from their vacuum values and eventually vanish. This is called the point of zero binding. In this situation the binding energy is the smallest scale in the problem and all the medium effects can be incorporated in the potential. If we start from pNRQCD and neglect the octet-singlet interactions the
dynamics of the singlet quark anti-quark field is given by the free field
equation, which is the form of the Schrödinger equation (e.g. see discussions in
Ref. <span id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p1.6.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\refcite</span>Brambilla:2004jw). Therefore, the calculation of the correlation function
of singlet fields in real time, or equivalently the calculation of quarkonium spectral function
in the non-relativistic limit, is reduced to calculating the Greens-function of the Schrödinger equation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite></p>

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">A simple potential model based on lattice QCD data on the singlet free energy has been
proposed to study quarkonium spectral functions and explain the observed temperature-independence of the quarkonium correlators <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite>. The imaginary part of the potential
has been neglected in this work, while the real part of the potential was based on lattice QCD data
on the singlet free energy. In this model all quarkonium states except the ground state bottomonium melt in the QGP.
However, the interaction between the heavy quark and anti-quark leads to large enhancement of the spectral function in
the threshold region.

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS5.p1.7" class="ltx_p">As discussed above, the in-medium corrections to the potential have both real and imaginary parts. For very small couplings the imaginary part of the potential is actually the dominant source of bound state dissolution. Therefore, any realistic calculation of quarkonium spectral functions should include both real and imaginary parts for the temperature-dependent potential. The hierarchy of scales assumed
in weak coupling calculations may not be satisfied and non-perturbative effects may play an important
role (see previous section). Thus, one has to rely on the lattice results. But, as mentioned before, the imaginary part of the potential cannot be extracted from
present lattice calculations. Therefore, in Ref. <span id="S2.SS4.SSS5.p1.7.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\refcite</span>Petreczky:2010tk the imaginary part of the potential was evaluated according

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the most interesting cases the heavy quark mass is well-separated from other scales.
Therefore, NRQCD is always a good effective theory and can be combined with non-perturbative
approaches like lattice QCD.
A lattice version of NRQCD has been successfully used to study bottomonium spectral functions non-perturbatively
(see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>]</cite>). This approach can also be used to study bottomonium spectral
functions at non-zero temperatures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>, <a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>]</cite>. Studying bottomonium spectral functions using
relativistic heavy quarks turns out to be difficult because of the noise, which is not
a problem in the non-relativistic formulation. In the NRQCD approach heavy quarks are not
subject to anti-periodic conditions and, therefore, the meson correlator can be studied up to
twice larger distances <math id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau&lt;1/T" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">τ</mi><mo id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><mrow id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">/</mo><mi id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">T</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1"><lt id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></lt><ci id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜏</ci><apply id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><divide id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></divide><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">1</cn><ci id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑇</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS4.SSS6.p1.1.m1.1c">\tau&lt;1/T</annotation></semantics></math> and has a simpler spectral decomposition</p>

At this point the state decays within one real-time oscillation of the quantum state.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, however, the precise value of the disassociation temperature is of little importance since even below this temperature the state under consideration is undergoing in-medium decays. In practice, one must compute the dynamical decay rate based on the local temperature and momentum-space anisotropy of the plasma and solve for the fraction of states remaining at a particular point in the plasma as a function of proper-time and then integrate/average over space-time. In order to carry this step out it is necessary to have a model of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the QGP. We will return this issue after the next subsection.</p>

For non-central collisions, the initial temperature decreases and, as a consequence, the lifetime of the plasma becomes shorter. In addition, the matter generated at all centralities has (on average) a spatial profile with the highest temperatures in the center of the overlap region and lower temperatures towards the edges. In order to make quantitatively reliable predictions for quarkonium suppression, it is necessary to use dynamical models which can accurately describe the full spatio-temporal evolution of the QGP.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we have attempted to make a compact review of (a) the theory of quarkonium states in the quark gluon plasma and (b) the phenomenology of quarkonium production in relativistic heavy ion collisions.
There has been significant progress since the original predictions of Matsui and Satz.
Thanks to first principles calculations available from lattice QCD it is possible to make non-perturbative studies of the behavior
of the heavy quark potential and quarkonium spectral functions.
Additionally, there has been significant progress made in recent years within the effective theory approach at zero and finite temperature
allowing a firm basis for systematically improvable potential model calculations. Using the effective theory approach,
somewhat unanticipated imaginary-valued contributions to the quarkonium potential have been identified in recent years.
These imaginary-valued contributions can be shown to be directly related to the in-medium decay of quarkonium states.
Depending on the QGP energy density and state under consideration, the implied in-medium widths are on the order of 20-100 MeV,
which is orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding vacuum widths.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Such large widths imply in-medium heavy-quarkonium lifetimes on the order of fm/c, thereby causing a blurring of the heretofore assumed pseudo-sharp
thresholds for the dissolution of different quarkonium states, commonly referred to as dissociation temperatures.
As a result, it is necessary to include the effect of such imaginary-valued contributions to the potential in phenomenological models
and a few authors have already begun to implement the necessary dynamical models. In addition, phenomenological models of quarkonium suppression
are seeing an across-the-board improvement in terms of the underlying dynamical models being used.
Most practitioners are moving towards using some variant of hydrodynamics (ideal, viscous, or anisotropic) which allows the dynamics of
collective flow and heavy quarkonium suppression to be described simultaneously. In addition, advances have been made in the modeling of the
process of recombination, even including effects of <math id="S4.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Q\bar{Q}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">Q</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mover accent="true" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">Q</mi><mo id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">¯</mo></mover></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑄</ci><apply id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3"><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1">¯</ci><ci id="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑄</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p2.1.m1.1c">Q\bar{Q}</annotation></semantics></math> spatial correlations in a statistical approach utilizing Langevin dynamics.

input which will hopefully help to constrain models of cold nuclear matter effects. Additionally, further refinements of the space-time models
of the quark gluon plasma are necessary including the incorporation of fluctuations in the viscous hydrodynamical treatments,
further investigation of the impact of momentum-space anisotropies, effects of finite velocity of quarkonium states relative to the medium, etc.
Through the concerted effort of both theoretical and experimental collaborations,
we hope to see continued progress towards a better understanding of the production and dynamics of quarkonium in the quark gluon plasma.</p>
