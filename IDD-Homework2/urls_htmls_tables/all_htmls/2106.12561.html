<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In Federated edge learning (FEEL), energy-constrained devices at the network edge consume significant energy when training and uploading their local machine learning models, leading to a decrease in their lifetime.
This work proposes novel solutions for energy-efficient FEEL by jointly considering local training data, available computation, and communications resources, and deadline constraints of FEEL rounds to reduce energy consumption.
This paper considers a system model where the edge server is equipped with multiple antennas employing beamforming techniques to communicate with the local users through orthogonal channels.
Specifically, we consider a problem that aims to find the optimal user’s resources, including the fine-grained selection of relevant training samples, bandwidth, transmission power, beamforming weights, and processing speed with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption given a deadline constraint on the communication rounds of FEEL.
Then, we devise tractable solutions by first proposing a novel fine-grained training algorithm that excludes less relevant training samples and effectively chooses only the samples that improve the model’s performance.
After that, we derive closed-form solutions, followed by a Golden-Section-based iterative algorithm to find the optimal computation and communication resources that minimize energy consumption.
Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms considerably outperform the state-of-the-art solutions as energy consumption decreases by 79% for MNIST and 73% for CIFAR-10 datasets.</p>

Lately, MEC techniques received a lot of attention from practitioners and researchers because of their potential in reducing latency and delivering an elegant quality of experience for end devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
It is envisioned that MEC will be an enabling tool for sixth-generation (6G) networks permitting new emerging applications, such as human-centric services, virtual reality, and augmented reality; consequently, realizing the vision of network intelligence<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Yet, transferring massive volumes of user data to a central server brings out unwanted communication costs and security risks due to the networks’ limitations, scalability issues, inadequate bandwidth, and most importantly, users’ privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated edge learning (FEEL) has emerged as a potential candidate that utilizes MEC to address these challenges<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.

FEEL strives to collaboratively train a shared <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ML</span> model on client devices while maintaining their privacy since data remains where it is produced, and only resultant model parameters are shared with the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
In FEEL rounds, the global model updating task, along with the associated computation and communication phases, expend significant energy even though the edge devices themselves are typically energy-constrained.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Energy constrained edge devices might negatively affect FEEL performance as the battery level may limit the worker’s ability to take part in more FEEL communication rounds; therefore, leading to a slower convergence rate.
It should be emphasized that our work focuses on the fine-grained selection of training samples. In this work, the fine-grained selection refers to using a subset of the local data samples for updating the global model. This fine-grained selection can be clearly contrasted with the literature, which focuses on the coarse-grained selection of workers whose datasets are either fully included or fully excluded (i.e., no partial inclusion/exclusion of data samples).
Some remarkably critical yet overlooked questions are: do all local data samples contribute equally to global model improvement? How can data be filtered to conserve energy while attaining the desired performance considering both network and device resource constraints? Does the deadline constraint help in optimizing the processing and transmission power? Are there other system parameters that can be optimized to save energy further?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, this paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a novel approach for model training, local computation, and communication resource allocation to support energy-efficient FEEL systems.
In this work, we adopt a unique approach in which we explore the fine-grained selection of training data for improved energy efficiency of FEEL. Our proposed approach is motivated by the fact that not all local data samples can significantly contribute to the global model.
We consider the FEEL system using a practical wireless network setting in which the battery-constrained edge devices are connected to the edge server.
The edge server is equipped with multiple antennas that employ beamforming techniques to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio.
Each edge device represents a worker that trains its local learning model using its local data and then sends the model parameters back to the edge server.
The edge server aggregates all local parameters and forms a global model.
Then the resulting model is broadcasted to the workers for further updates.
Due to the limited bandwidth, only a subset of these workers is chosen at every FEEL round to take part in the training process. To synchronize the updates and avoid long waiting times, the server employs a FEEL round deadline constraint.
The key contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Focusing on energy constraints, Zeng <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> considered the energy-efficiency of FEEL where the goal is to minimize the total energy consumption.
A minimization problem is formulated, and a greedy allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate more resources to weak devices.
However, the local computation energy consumption is not considered as it is assumed to be fixed and uniform among all devices, which is impractical as the data is imbalanced, and the processing capabilities are varied. In  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, Wang <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> studied energy-efficiency for FEEL where the computation and communication resources are considered.
An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the completion time as well as computation and transmission energy.
Furthermore, the authors in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed an approach to minimize the total energy consumption across all workers during predefined training time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that some prior works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> introduced their approaches in a coarse-grained level, assuming that all data samples of any selected client are used in every local iteration.
The stragglers (i.e., the devices with bad channels, low CPU speed, or insufficient energy) aren’t considered, which might delay the whole training cycle.
Specifically, the deadline of FEEL communication rounds is not considered where the server has to wait before fusing the updates and starting a new FEEL training round.
Often, the whole completion time is considered while overlooking the effects of data and device heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can lead to scenarios in which some devices finish their task earlier while others may stay ideal for a long time waiting for the fused model to start a new FEEL round.
Also, the energy budget is not considered, which is essential to complete the updates.</p>

Specifically, we adopt a unique approach that allows for the fine-grained selection of training data for improved energy efficiency of FEEL. Our proposed approach is motivated by the fact that not all local data samples can significantly contribute to the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.

On the worker side, the received global model is used as a reference to train the local models and control the divergence.
All these steps incur massive energy consumption; thus, for each worker to join the learning process, local data samples, energy budget, FEEL round deadline, and computation and communication capabilities are considered to ensure a robust FEEL system and avoid losing selected worker updates due to insufficient energy or FEEL round deadline time out.

In step 2, the server collects prior information such as data size, battery level, channel state from possible clients willing to participate.
In steps 4-5 of Algorithm <a href="#alg3" title="Algorithm 3 ‣ V-D Proposed Energy-Efficient FEEL Approach ‣ V PROPOSED APPROACHES ‣ Fine-Grained Data Selection for Improved Energy Efficiency of Federated Edge Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the server specifies the FEEL round deadline, selects the workers, and broadcasts the global model parameters for local updates.
In step 7, all selected workers receive the global parameters from the server.

In step 9, each client finds the optimal beamforming weight by solving  (<a href="#S5.E27" title="Equation 27 ‣ V-C Iterative Algorithm To Complete The Solutions of P2 ‣ V PROPOSED APPROACHES ‣ Fine-Grained Data Selection for Improved Energy Efficiency of Federated Edge Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">27</span></a>).
As a consequence, in step 10, each worker runs Algorithm<a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ V-C Iterative Algorithm To Complete The Solutions of P2 ‣ V PROPOSED APPROACHES ‣ Fine-Grained Data Selection for Improved Energy Efficiency of Federated Edge Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> to find computation and communication time and the associated local processing speed and transmission power that conserves the energy consumption.

It is observed that the proposed approach shows a significant reduction in energy consumption compared to the baselines.
This gain is proportional to the number of FEEL global rounds.
This is due to the fact that when more samples are injected into training at the beginning, the model needs more FEEL rounds to capture local patterns and specialize the global model.
The model then can predict some samples with high confidence in the later FEEL rounds and then excludes the samples having less impact on the model quality for the remaining <math id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(\varepsilon-1)" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">ε</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"><minus id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1"></minus><ci id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">𝜀</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1c">(\varepsilon-1)</annotation></semantics></math> epochs.

We use this scenario to showcase the performance of the proposed approach in conjunction with more complex learning tasks.
We can note that, in general, training the model using CIFAR-10 consumes more energy compared to the MNIST.
Nevertheless, the proposed approach still provides significant performance gain, and it conserves substantial energy even through the dataset and corresponding model are complex.
This stems from the ability of the global model to exclude less important data samples leading to a reduction in the computation time and energy while providing more flexibility to optimize the transmission energy as more time is assigned for transmission.</p>

It can be noticed that our proposed approach conserves energy regardless of the number of workers, while it is clear that as the number of workers decreases, more energy is consumed per worker.
This stems from the nature of non-i.i.d data distribution.
As fewer workers are involved during the training process, the model cannot learn and identify more heterogeneous and diverse data, leading to a slower convergence rate as shown on <a href="#S6.F11.sf1" title="In Fig. 11 ‣ VI-B3 Impacts of The Number of Selected Workers on The Performance ‣ VI-B Performance Evaluation ‣ VI Simulation and Numerical Results ‣ Fine-Grained Data Selection for Improved Energy Efficiency of Federated Edge Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figs.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11(a)</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F11.sf2" title="Fig. 11(b) ‣ Fig. 11 ‣ VI-B3 Impacts of The Number of Selected Workers on The Performance ‣ VI-B Performance Evaluation ‣ VI Simulation and Numerical Results ‣ Fine-Grained Data Selection for Improved Energy Efficiency of Federated Edge Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11(b)</span></a>.
These figures show the instantaneous results of the testing loss and accuracy when 5% of the workers participate in the training process.
It is observed that the higher the threshold probability, the best performance gain compared to the benchmarks regardless of the number of participating workers.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a novel energy-efficient FEEL approach that contributes to significant improvements in terms of energy consumption.
We take advantage of using a fine-grained data selection approach that excludes data samples that do not significantly contribute to the loss function.
In our proposed approach, each worker tunes the received global model parameters while intelligently excluding the samples predicted with high probability based on a predefined threshold. Such samples do not introduce significant contributions to the learning model and their use can adversely impact energy consumption. The proposed approach tunes the transmission power and local CPU speed of workers in a FEEL system to enhance energy efficiency.
We also exploit the FEEL round deadline constraint to optimize the uploading time and further reduce the expended energy.
Furthermore, we devise an iterative algorithm based on the Golden-section search method to obtain beamforming weights, allocated bandwidth, the local CPU frequency, and transmission power.
Our experimental results demonstrate outstanding potential for reducing the total energy consumption of FEEL systems.
Eventually, we show that energy can be significantly saved by adopting our proposed find-grained data selection approach.
For future directions, accounting for the relationship between the threshold value and the intended learning task can be regarded.</p>
