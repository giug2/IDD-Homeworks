<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Artificial neural network has achieved unprecedented success in a wide variety of domains such as classifying, predicting and recognizing objects. This success depends on the availability of big data since the training process requires massive and representative data sets. However, data collection is often prevented by privacy concerns and people want to take control over their sensitive information during both training and using processes. To address this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving method for the distributed system, Stochastic Channel-Based Federated Learning (SCBF), which enables the participants to train a high-performance model cooperatively without sharing their inputs. We design, implement and evaluate a channel-based update algorithm for the central server in a distributed system, which selects the channels with regard to the most active features in a training loop and uploads them as learned information from local datasets. A pruning process is applied to the algorithm based on the validation set, which serves as a model accelerator. In the experiment, our model presents equal performances and higher saturating speed than the Federated Averaging method which reveals all the parameters of local models to the server when updating. We also demonstrate that the converging rates could be increased by introducing a pruning process.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conventional deep learning, all training data are shared to the central server who performs the analysis, and the clients who contribute the data have no control over it. That means, each client may have to upload their sensitive data to the server and do not know what the data is actually used for. Furthermore, the learned model is generally not directly available to the client so that they have to reveal the inputs to the cloud when using the model <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:b32</span>, risking privacy leakage in both training and using processes. Federated learning can address this problem by introducing some algorithmic techniques that distribute its learning process to local devices so that the clients could keep their data private and obtain a local model for future use.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated optimization has been studied by J. Konečný et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> for distributed optimization in machine learning. This work introduces a setting for distributed optimization where none of the typical assumptions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> are satisfied, making federated learning a practical alternative to current methods. The proposed framework is different from conventional distributed machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> for the large number of clients, highly unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data available on each client, and relatively poor network connections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In the problem of the last constraint, Konečný, Jakub, et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have proposed two approaches, structured updates and sketched updates, to reduce the uplink communication costs. McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> advocates the Federated SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) and Federated Averaging algorithms as practical methods for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging. Opposed to protect a single data point’s contribution in learning a model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, R. C. Geyer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed an algorithm for client sided federated optimization in order to hide clients’ contributions during training. Further, methods to strengthen the reliability of federated learning, such as Secure Aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, essentially require some notion of synchronization on a fixed set of devices, so that the server side of the learning algorithm only consumes a simple aggregate of the updates from many users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Applications based on federated learning algorithm have been proposed in several domains, ranging from content suggestions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to next word prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Research done by Bagdasaryan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> focus on the vulnerability of federated learning. This work shows that federated learning algorithm is vulnerable to a model-poisoning attack, which is different from poisoning attacks that target only the training data.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the direct leakage of privacy as mentioned before, participants in the distributed system may indirectly reveal some information about the sensitive data via the weights uploaded to the server in the training process. Addressing the direct as well as the indirect privacy leakage, we developed the Stochastic Channel-Based Federated Learning (SCBF) method which enables the local participants manipulate their data confidentially while benefit their model’s performance from the server with only small proportion of the local trained gradients stochastically revealed to the central model.</p>

It is useful because conventional deep learning has great privacy concerns which may prevent the company from collecting data for model training. A model-inversion attack may extract parts of the training data through a deep learning network, as Fredrikson et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> demonstrated. One might attempt to reduce the risk of privacy leakage is adding noise to the parameters that result from the training process. However, it’s hard to achieve a balance between performances and privacy preserving since stronger noise brings protection for privacy as well as worse performances. Therefore, we seek ways that help to preserve local privacy during the training process.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Addressing the problems mentioned above, the Stochastic Channel-Based Federated Learning (SCBF) realizes the function of differential privacy preserving by protecting the two sources of potential privacy leakage from federated learning: the actual values of uploaded gradients from the local participants and the mechanism these gradients are chosen <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:b32</span>. By setting a threshold to select the parameters of gradients channel-wise, the actual values uploaded to the server are stored in a sparse tensor that processed from Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a stochastic training process which has already been used for many privacy preserving cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Training a model with privacy-preserving methods could be time-consuming, especially when training sets are enormous. Addressing this problem, we introduce a neural network pruning process to SCBF that could prune off the redundant nodes in the neural network based on the validation set, thus saving a lot of time. This work is done circularly in the first several global loops until the distributed system reaches a suitable scale, enabling SCBF with Pruning (SCBFwP) to efficiently learn from the datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Neural network pruning is not a brand-new concept. Yang <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> proposed a way to prune connections based on weights magnitude. Y. He <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> used a channel pruning method to accelerate deep convolutional neural network. H. Han and J. Qiao <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> introduced a growing-and-pruning approach for FNN (fuzzy neural network). In the work done by Srinivas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, a systematic way was proposed to prune one neuron at a time, addressing the problem of pruning parameters in a trained NN model.</p>

<p id="S1.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Stochastic Channel-Based Federated Learning (SCBF) could address both direct and indirect privacy leakage concerns, which trains client models on the local datasets and improve the server performance by uploading a proportion of gradients. The clients do not need to share their datasets with the server model during training process nor reveal their inputs when using it. Moreover, the inverse-model attack which analyzes information from the uploaded parameters could be obstructed by the stochastic nature of our upload algorithm taking advantage of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Our model achieves better performance than Federated Averaging, a state-of-the-art federated learning method, without uploading model weights. And the SCBF with Pruning (SCBFwP) could speed up the saturating of performance and save executing time. Better performance could be achieved by tuning the pruning proportion to cut off redundant neurons in the network.</p>

Pre-experiments are conducted to decide the proper structure for the proposed model. Through manual tuning, we find out that the model achieves best performance with high efficiency using 3 layers. So for each local client, we construct an artificial neural network for binary prediction of mortality with 3 fully connected layers and 64, 32, 1 neurons in corresponding layers using ReLU activation at hidden layers and sigmoid activation at the output layer.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the observation that different features do not contribute equally to the training process and the importance of each feature may vary from one dataset to another, Stochastic Channel-Based Federated Learning (SCBF) is a privacy-preserving approach which seizes the most vital information from the local training results only by uploading a small fraction of gradients stochastically. The intuition behind this method is that the biological neural circuit follows the Law of Use and Disuse and the strongest neurons for an individual is those constitute an active circuit in its learning process, suggesting that the neurons in one artificial neural network is not independent through a specific training process. Thus we could consider the collaborative effect of neurons in each channel (similar to the biological neural circuit) when selecting parameters for server update: if a channel of neurons change a lot in a training loop, we can assume it be a strong neural circuit in the network, corresponding to a sensitive feature in the input sets; While the neural channels with little change in one training loop should be regarded as deteriorated ones, whose information could be kept private with little effect on the server’s final performance. Choosing the channels with the most substantial variation enables SCBF to only upload a small percent of the gradients in each training loop while achieving comparable accuracy to the Federated Averaging (FA) method without uploading the integrate local weights to the server, as will be demonstrated in the result part.</p>

However, time-consuming and overfitting are two main problems a complex model may lead to. Addressing these problems, we introduced a pruning process to cut off the redundant neurons in the network, saving much of the time during the training process.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The update rate controls how many channels are selected whose non-zero part is uploaded to the server in each global loop, playing a vital role in affecting the final performance. To choose a suitable update rate for our distributed system, we implement SCBF models with different update rates ranging from 10% to 100%. The neural network pruning is used in this step to accelerate the training process. The performances are plotted in the first row of Fig <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-A Stochastic Channel-Based Federated Learning ‣ III Results ‣ Privacy Preserving Stochastic Channel-Based Federated Learning with Neural Network Pruning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. The result shows that even with 10% channels uploaded to the server, the SCBF model achieves an AUCROC of 0.9776 and an AUCPR of 0.9695, and this result even outperforms the model when sharing all parameters with the server. It confirms the intuition behind SCBF: the importance of a feature differs when training on different datasets, and we could extract important information from the channels that features with biggest variations go through. We could infer that less than 10% of the channels contain the most fundamental information and ignoring the rest information does little harm to the learning of models. Besides, using a wide range of upload rates only leads to a 0.01319 amplitude in AUCROC and a 0.02739 amplitude in AUCPR, which facilitates the configuration process with a stable high performance.</p>

After 100 global loops, the AUCROC of SCBF is 0.0033 higher than FA and the AUCPR of SCBF is 0.0032 higher than FA. We could conclude that our method achieves comparative performance to the Federated Averaging method with higher saturating speed. What stands out in our method is that our model doesn’t have to reveal the overall local models to the server and makes it hard for attackers to track the channels we choose.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To speed up the training process and reduce the size of the neural network, we conduct network pruning for several loops after pre-training the model. It is important to train a small-scaled deep learning model with high processing speed. In our trail, we set the pruning rate for each global loop to 10%, which demonstrates the proportion of neurons to be pruned in the training loop. The total proportion of neurons to be pruned in the first several loops is set to 47%, which decides the final scale of pruned model.

The results show that network pruning could speed up training process and accelerate convergence while maintaining higher performances. The results also show, as expected, that pruning 47% neurons from the network will decrease the final performance due to the simplified model structure. The AUCROC for SCBF with pruning is reduced by 0.0048 and the AUCPR for it is reduced by 0.006814. We can observe a reduction of 0.0012 in AUCROC and 0.0047 in AUCPR for Federated Averaging method compared to FA with pruning. The reduction in performances is negligible in many application situations but the acceleration in both saturating speed and training speed is quite beneficial, the latter of which will be discussed in the following section.</p>

The total pruned fractions are calculated and annotated in the corresponding labels. The figure shows that SCBF gets better performance when reducing the times of pruning. The results with a fixed pruning rate is more stable than those with a fixed total pruned rate, indicating that people should pay more attention to the selection of pruning rate for each step when building models and it is stable for a SCBF model to adjust the times of neural network pruning.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a privacy-preserving approach for distributed systems whose models are trained based on any type of neural network. Our methodology develops a channel-based update algorithm for the server, which enables the system to achieve a state-of-the-art performance without forcing the participants to reveal their inputs nor the local model weights to the server. Addressing the concern raised by inverse-model attacks, our model uploads a fraction of channels in the gradients from local models to the server and achieves better performance with 10% channels uploaded than 100% on the medical datasets, reducing the redundancy of gradients while preserving the privacy. Moreover, we introduced a neural pruning process to the model, which could accelerate the training process and saturating speed of performances with little sacrifice of the final performances.</p>
