<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively learn a powerful global machine learning model without sharing the training data with the server. As a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient distributed learning framework, FL has garnered substantial research attention and has surged as a key enabler of distributed intelligence in many real-world applications, such as next-word prediction on mobile keyboards <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and medical record analysis in digital health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In the vanilla FL algorithm, known as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the server distributes the current global model to all the clients in each round, which serves as the basis for running several steps of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the local data for each client. The local updates are then sent back to the server to update the global model. This process is iterated until the global model converges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, clients can be diverse, ranging from medical wearables and IoT devices to smartphones. Many of these clients operate as low-power devices and communicate over wireless networks. This presents a challenge to FedAvg, as clients may abort training midway due to issues like low battery levels or incoming calls <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. As a result, clients may fail to return their trained local updates to the server, especially when the communication from the clients to the server is hampered by poor channel quality and intermittent connectivity (also referred to as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">unavailable / non-participating clients</span> or the <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">partial client participation problem</span>). In FedAvg, the inability to receive local updates from unavailable clients can cause a serious delay and it can even discard these updates when deriving the global model to maintain learning efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Missing the expected local updates introduces an undesired bias against unavailable clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. This will result in the global model overfitting the characteristics of consistently available clients, thereby diminishing its performance for clients that participate less frequently and reducing its overall generalization capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The primary goal of this paper is to develop and validate an efficient FL algorithm termed <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">F</span>ederated Learning with local update <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">A</span>pproximation and <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">R</span>ectification (FedAR), which addresses the partial client participation problem. We first study the contributions of the latest observed local updates from unavailable clients to the global update. Our observation reveals that unavailable clients with varying inactive rounds exert diverse positive influences on the global update. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel server-side aggregation strategy that incorporates local updates from unavailable clients in the global update. More importantly, our framework does not require any additional computation at the clients or introduce any extra communication between the clients and the server. FedAR utilizes the latest update from each client observed by the server as a surrogate of its current update, which is then used in updating the global model. Moreover, we devise an innovative weighting scheme to accommodate the variable influence on the global model from local updates of clients with differing inactive rounds. We slightly magnify the contributions from unavailable clients (based on the number of inactive rounds) in addition to the contributions from the available clients, to update the global model. To achieve this, we design the weight as a mildly increasing function of the number of inactive rounds of each client. This strategy enables the server to include the local data distribution information from unavailable clients in updating the global model, thereby circumventing the bias against these clients. Lastly, unlike traditional FL, FedAR does not assume that the server is aware of the total number of clients in advance. Instead, it dynamically counts the number of clients who get involved in the global model update, which better reflects real-world application scenarios. In light of the above discussion, we summarize our key contributions in this paper as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the main challenges of the vanilla FL algorithm, FedAvg, is the intermittent unavailability of clients. Specifically, the server will not update the global model until receiving local updates from all clients, which results in considerable training delay in the presence of client unavailability. Client sampling can be used as a remedy to this issue, where some clients are selected to participate in the global model update. The common client sample strategies include random sampling, significant sampling, and cluster sampling. Random sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> selects clients at random whereas importance sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> selects the most valuable clients in terms of data quantity, communication time, and local training results. In cluster sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, clients are first divided into groups based on sample size, model similarity etc.; the clients in each group are then selected for global update. All these sampling strategies engage only available clients but ignore unavailable clients in the global update. Consequently, the global model biases towards the available clients that are selected repetitively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which would undermine the FL performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A body of research addresses the client unavailability issue by incorporating stale updates from unavailable clients into the training process, such as the Memory-augmented Impatient Federated Averaging (MIFA) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and the Federated VAriance Reduction for Partial Client Participation (FedVARP) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Their major differences with FedAR are listed in Table. <a href="#S2.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ FedAR: Addressing Client Unavailability in Federated Learning with Local Update Approximation and Rectification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In particular, seeking to maximize non-IID data coverage, MIFA gives equal weightage to updates from both available and unavailable clients, making it a biased scheme. Even worse, MIFA requires all clients to participate in the first training round, which is an unrealistic assumption. FedVARP allocates higher weights to the updates from available clients than to the updates from unavailable clients. It also attempts to reduce the variance to available clients caused by the partial client partition, which, however, is not empirically demonstrated. Similar to both MIFA and FedVARP, the FedAR algorithm reuses the latest observed update for each client as an approximation of its current update. Different from MIFA, FedAR formulates a novel weighting scheme to efficiently involve unavailable clients with various inactive rounds in the global model update. Moreover, FedAR does not require all clients to participate in FL in the first training round. Motivated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, FedAR assigns higher weights to the updates of the unavailable clients with a larger number of inactive rounds, i.e., we amplify the local updates from unavailable clients, which is contrary to FedVARP. Our experimental results show the efficacy of FedAR in terms of overall convergence, test accuracy and bias mitigation, compared to relevant baselines.</p>

Due to this, FedAvg delays or even aborts the local updates from unavailable clients during the global update, causing an undesirable bias against these unavailable clients. However, the local updates from the unavailable clients also contain valuable information, which can be useful in global model updates. We conduct a toy experiment on a simple, restricted setup to demonstrate this idea and provide motivation for our approach.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FedAR is designed as a simple and effective algorithm by involving local updates of unavailable clients in the global model update on the server. In addition, given that a client’s unavailability leads to decreased contributions, we assign weights to different local updates accordingly. Our goal is to enhance FL performance by efficiently involving updates from all clients in the global model update. Specifically, FedAR consists of two components: <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local update approximation</span> and <span id="S4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local update rectification</span>. In each round, the server sets a maximum waiting time for the local updates from all clients. When the maximum waiting time is reached, the server estimates the local updates that would be obtained from the unavailable clients. The weighted average over all the local updates is then performed to derive the global model for the next round. We describe our system in detail next.</p>

The surge in the number of clients inherently leads to a rise in unavailable clients, posing challenges across all algorithms. This suggests that FedAR is more adept at handling a large number of clients, making it ideal for large-scale FL, especially in the presence of significant client unavailability.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel FL algorithm, FedAR, to address the client unavailability. We found that clients with different numbers of inactive rounds have diverse contributions to the current global update. Based on this observation, we design a novel weighting strategy that not only engages the unavailable clients in the global model update, but also quantifies their contributions based on the number of their inactive rounds. We theoretically prove the convergence of FedAR for both convex and non-convex smooth loss functions with non-IID data across clients. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedAR significantly outperforms competing FL baselines FedAvg, MIFA, FedVARP and Scaffold with respect to the training loss, the test accuracy, and the bias mitigation. FedAR further demonstrates remarkable performance and surpasses those baselines in large-scale FL with severe client unavailability. As part of future work, we will study the performance of FedAR under other practical challenges such as missing data and class imbalance across clients.</p>
