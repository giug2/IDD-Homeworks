<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) can be used in mobile edge networks to train machine learning models in a distributed manner. Recently, FL has been interpreted within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework, which brings FL significant advantages in fast adaptation and convergence over heterogeneous datasets. However, existing research simply combines MAML and FL without explicitly addressing how much benefit MAML brings to FL and how to maximize such benefit over mobile edge networks. In this paper, we quantify the benefit from two aspects: optimizing FL hyperparameters (i.e., sampled data size and the number of communication rounds) and resource allocation (i.e., transmit power) in mobile edge networks. Specifically, we formulate the MAML-based FL design as an overall learning time minimization problem, under the constraints of model accuracy and energy consumption. Facilitated by the convergence analysis of MAML-based FL, we decompose the formulated problem and then solve it using analytical solutions and the coordinate descent method. With the obtained FL hyperparameters and resource allocation, we design a MAML-based FL algorithm, called Automated Federated Learning (AutoFL), that is able to conduct fast adaptation and convergence. Extensive experimental results verify that AutoFL outperforms other benchmark algorithms regarding the learning time and convergence performance.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, modern mobile user equipments (UEs) such as smart phones and wearable devices have been equipped with advanced powerful sensing and computing capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">1</span></a>]</cite>.
This enables their access to a wealth of data that are suitable for learning models, which brings countless opportunities for meaningful applications such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) medical diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">2</span></a>]</cite> and air quality monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">3</span></a>]</cite>.
Traditionally, learning models requires data to be processed in a cloud data center <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">4</span></a>]</cite>.
However, due to the long distance between the devices where data is generated and the servers in data centers, cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) for mobile UEs may incur unacceptable latencies and communication overhead.
Therefore, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">5</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">6</span></a>]</cite> has been proposed to facilitate the deployment of servers near the base station (BS) at mobile edge networks, so as to bring intelligence to network edge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In mobile edge networks, for a traditional ML paradigm, it is inevitable to upload raw data from mobile UEs to a server which could be deployed near the BS for model learning.
However, the unprecedented amount of data created by mobile UEs are private in nature, leading to the increasing concern of data security and user privacy.
To address this issue, Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">7</span></a>]</cite> as a new ML paradigm.
FL in mobile edge networks refers to training models across multiple distributed UEs without ever uploading their raw data to the server.
In particular, UEs compute local updates to the current global model based on their own local data, which are then aggregated and fed-back by an edge server, so that all UEs have access to the same global model for their new local updates.
Such a procedure is implemented in one communication round and is repeated until a certain model accuracy is reached.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its promising benefits, FL also comes with new challenges in practice. Particularly, the datasets across UEs are <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">heterogenous</span>.
Not only does the number of data samples generated by UEs vary, but these data samples are usually not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d).
Learning from such heterogeneous data is not easy, as conventional FL algorithms usually develop a <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">common</span> model for all UEs [8–10] such that, the global model obtained by minimizing the average loss could perform arbitrarily poorly once applied to the local dataset of a specific UE.
That is, the global model derived from conventional FL algorithms may conduct weak adaptations to local UEs. Such weak adaptations will further restrict the convergence rate of the FL algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Multiple techniques are emerging as promising solutions to the data heterogeneity problem, such like adding user context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">8</span></a>]</cite>, transfer-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">9</span></a>]</cite>, multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">10</span></a>]</cite>, and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">11</span></a>]</cite>. Of all these techniques, MAML is the only one that not only addresses the heterogenous data problem, but greatly speeds up the FL learning process as well.
MAML is a well-known meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">12</span></a>]</cite> approach that learns from the past experience to adapt to new tasks much faster.
Such adaptations make it possible for MAML to develop well-behaved user-specific models.
More specifically, MAML aims to find a sensitive <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">initial</span> point that learned from the past experience to conduct <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fast</span> adaptations requiring only a few data points on each UE.
With the learned initial model, MAML dramatically speeds up the learning process by replacing hand-engineered algorithms with an <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">automated</span>, data-driven approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">13</span></a>]</cite>.
Fortunately, in both MAML and FL, existing algorithms use a variant of gradient descent method locally, and send an overall update to a coordinator to update the global model.
This similarity makes it possible to interpret FL within a MAML framework  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">14</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">15</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">16</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">17</span></a>]</cite>.
Such a simple MAML-based FL is termed as Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), and the algorithm that realizes PFL is termed as Personalized FederatedAveraging (Per-FedAvg).
However, Per-FedAvg is a pure ML algorithm, and how to apply it into practical mobile edge networks remains <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">unclear</span>.
Recently several attempts have been made to study the implementation of Per-FedAvg in practice. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">18</span></a>]</cite> proposes a framework to execute Per-FedAvg for intelligent IoT applications without considering Per-FedAvg’s strength in saving learning time. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">19</span></a>]</cite>, although aims to achieve fast learning for IoT applications at the edge, does not consider the resource allocation in a practical mobile edge network.
Therefore, to what degree a MAML-based FL algorithm expedites FL in mobile edge networks and under what conditions such benefit could be achieved still remain to be unexplored areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In order to quantify the benefit MAML brings to FL in mobile edge networks, we consider two aspects to minimize the overall learning time: optimizing learning-related hyperparameters as well as resource allocation.
On the one hand, the typical FL hyperparameters, including the sampled data sizes across UEs and the number of communication rounds, have significant impact on the overall learning time and thus, these hyperparameters need to be carefully specified.
On the other hand, the resource allocation should be considered to account for UEs’ practical wireless communication environments and limited battery lifetimes. Particularly, due to the existence of random channel gain and noise over wireless channels, the transmit power allocation on an UE will decide whether the transmitted updates from the UE can be successfully decoded by the edge server. Restricted by the limited battery lifetime, it will also determine whether the remaining energy on that UE is sufficient to support its local training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.2" class="ltx_p">It is non-trivial to solve the formulated optimization problem considering above two quantitative dimensions, given that the relationship between the variables (i.e., the sampled data sizes across UEs, the number of communication rounds, and the transmit power on UEs) and the model accuracy <math id="S1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math> is implicit.
Therefore, we start with the convergence analysis of the MAML-based FL algorithm, by which the three variables are bounded as functions of <math id="S1.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.2.m2.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.2.m2.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math>.
After that, the formulated optimization problem can be approximatively decoupled into three sub-problems, each of which accounts for one of the three variables. Specifically, solving the first sub-problem gives an insight to achieve the required number of communication round.
As for the other two sub-problems, we use the coordinate descent method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">20</span></a>]</cite> to compute the sampled data size and the transmit power of all UEs iteratively.
In other words, we first give an initial value of the transmit power of UEs, and use it to compute the sampled data sizes in the second sub-problem; then with the attained sampled data sizes, we compute the transmit power in the third sub-problem. This process repeats until a certain model accuracy is achieved.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.5" class="ltx_p">The solution to the optimization problem guides us to the design of Automated Federated Learning (AutoFL).

By solving these sub-problems, the number of communication rounds can be characterized using a closed-form solution, while the sampled data sizes and the transmit power of all UEs in each round can be achieved using the coordinate descent method. With the optimized hyperparameters and resource allocation, we further propose AutoFL with fast adaptation and convergence.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Per-FedAvg is a MAML-based FL algorithm, which suggests a general approach to use the MAML method for solving the data heterogeneity problem in FL.
It is proposed with focus on the personalization in FL, which is a natural feature inherited from MAML.
Except for the personalization, MAML is also a few-shot learning approach, as only a few samples are required to learn new skills after just minutes of experience.
Therefore, Per-FedAvg also inherits this feature of MAML, thereby adapting quickly from only a few samples.
To what degree of fast adaptation MAML benefits FL and under what conditions such benefit can be achieved is what exactly this paper is about.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider the above described MAML-based FL. In detail, we concentrate on the situation where UEs communicate in a <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">synchronous</span> manner, so as to avoid using outdated parameters for global model update and make high-quality refinement in each round.
Meanwhile, for each UE, we consider the case that only one step of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is performed, following the same setting as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:80%;">11</span></a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.21" class="ltx_p">When exploring the MAML-based FL in realistic mobile edge networks, the communication and computation model should be captured carefully. Particularly, we consider that UEs access the BS through a channel partitioning scheme, such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA).
In order to successfully upload the local update to the BS, two conditions need to be satisfied: (1) the UE is selected, and (2) the transmitted local update is successfully decoded.

This decoupling only provides the approximate optimal results. However, the evaluation results show that, with the approximate optimal results obtained from (P2), (P3) and (P4), the proposed MAML-based FL algorithm always outperforms Per-FedAvg in learning time and convergence performances.

FedAvg is the first algorithm that is proposed for FL and is the most general FL algorithm. Per-FedAvg, on the other hand, is the most general MAML-based FL algorithm.

We name the FedAvg algorithm with the first setting as FedAvg-1;
For the second one, we set the sampled data sizes and transmit power of the UEs to be the same with AutoFL.
We name the FedAvg with the second setting as FedAvg-2.
Later, we may change the sampled data sizes in Per-FedAvg and FedAvg-1 to check the influence of the number of sampled data on the performance gap between Per-FedAvg and AutoFL.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first compare the learning time of AutoFL with that of Per-FedAvg, FedAvg-1, and FedAvg-2 with respect to the test accuracy.
The results are shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ V-A2 Datasets ‣ V-A Simulation Settings ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ Automated Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Networks — Fast Adaptation and Convergence" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We analyse the results from three aspects. (i) First, it is clear that at the same accuracy, AutoFL consumes the smallest learning time.
For example, when the algorithms start to converge, Per-FedAvg takes at least twice as much time as AutoFL.
This is a reasonable result as AutoFL is designed to minimize the overall learning time.
Meanwhile, as the test accuracy increases, the average learning time of all algorithms grows rapidly.
The experimental results verify our theoretical analysis and confirms the effectiveness of AutoFL in saving the overall learning time. (ii) Second, we observe that the two MAML-based FL algorithms outperform the two conventional FL algorithms. This advantage is even more pronounced when using the non-i.i.d CIFAR-10 dataset rather than the MNIST datasets. This result testifies the advantage of MAML in accelerating the training speed of FL.
Meanwhile, the two algorithms with designed sampled data size and transmit power, AutoFL and FedAvg-2 outperform Per-FedAvg and FedAvg-1. This indicates that the joint optimization of the sampled data size and transmit power is a promising way to improve the FL performance over mobile edge networks. (iii) Third, the results derived from i.i.d datasets are more stable than that from non-i.i.d datasets, meanwhile the average learning time under i.i.d datasets is smaller than that under non-i.i.d datasets. This is because, in the i.i.d case, the local model of each individual UE has a higher representative for the learned global model, which is beneficial to improve the learning performance.</p>

We attribute this phenomenon to the reason that the larger sampled data size requires the larger transmit power. And once the transmit power of a certain UE reaches its upper bound, it can not be improved.
Due to insufficient transmit power, the uploads transmitted from this UE fail to arrive the server for global model update.
Therefore, although the number of samples on each UE has increased, the learning time may have become longer and longer.
This result gives us great confidence, that although the original problem (P1) is NP-hard, and AutoFL is designed to approximate the optimal solutions to (P1), the approximate results are also effective in consuming as little time as possible.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have quantified the benefit MAML brings to FL over mobile edge networks.
The quantification is achieved from two aspects: the determination of FL hyperparameters (i.e., sampled data sizes and the number of communication rounds) and the resource allocation (i.e., transmit power) on individual UEs.
In this regard, we have formulated an overall learning time minimization problem, constrained by the model accuracy and energy consumption at individual UEs.
We have solved this optimization problem by firstly analysing the convergence rate of MAML-based FL, which is used to bound the three variables as functions of the model accuracy <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math>.
With these upper bounds, the optimization problem can be decoupled into three sub-problems, each of which considers one of the variables and uses the corresponding upper bound as its constraint.
The first sub-problem guides the optimization of the number of communication rounds. The second and the third sub-problem are computed using the coordinate descent method, to achieve the sampled data size and the transmit power for each UE in each round respectively.
Based on the solutions, we have proposed the AutoFL, a MAML-based FL algorithm that not only quantifies the benefit MAML brings to FL but also maximize such benefit to conduct fast adaptation and convergence over mobile edge networks.
Extensive experimental results have verified that AutoFL outperforms Per-FedAvg and FedAvg, with the fast adaptation and convergence.</p>
