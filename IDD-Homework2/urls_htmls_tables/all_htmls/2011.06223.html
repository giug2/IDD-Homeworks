<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning enables training a global model from data located at the client nodes, without data sharing and moving client data to a centralized server. Performance of federated learning in a multi-access edge computing (MEC) network suffers from slow convergence due to heterogeneity and stochastic fluctuations in compute power and communication link qualities across clients. We propose a novel <span id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">coded computing</span> framework, CodedFedL, that injects structured coding redundancy into federated learning for mitigating stragglers and speeding up the training procedure. CodedFedL enables coded computing for non-linear federated learning by efficiently exploiting <span id="id1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">distributed kernel embedding</span> via random Fourier features that transforms the training task into computationally favourable distributed linear regression. Furthermore, clients generate <span id="id1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local parity</span> datasets by coding over their local datasets, while the server combines them to obtain the <span id="id1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global parity</span> dataset. Gradient from the global parity dataset compensates for straggling gradients during training, and thereby speeds up convergence. For minimizing the <span id="id1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">epoch deadline time</span> at the MEC server, we provide a tractable approach for finding the amount of coding redundancy and the number of local data points that a client processes during training, by exploiting the statistical properties of compute as well as communication delays. We also characterize the leakage in data privacy when clients share their local parity datasets with the server. Additionally, we analyze the convergence rate and iteration complexity of CodedFedL under simplifying assumptions, by treating CodedFedL as a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Finally, for demonstrating gains that CodedFedL can achieve in practice, we conduct numerical experiments using practical network parameters and benchmark datasets, in which CodedFedL speeds up the overall training time by up to <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="15\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1b"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1">15</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="id1.1.m1.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">15\times</annotation></semantics></math> in comparison to the benchmark schemes.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In classical MEC settings, client data is transferred to an underlying centralized computational infrastructure for further processing. However, client data can be of a personalized nature due to which there is an increasing privacy concern in moving the client data to a central location for any model training. For example, a person may want to use a machine learning application to predict health events like low sugar, but may not be willing to share the health records.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning framework has been recently developed to carry out machine learning tasks from data distributed at the client nodes, while the raw data is kept at the clients and never uploaded to the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. As first formulated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, federated learning proceeds in two major steps. First, every client carries out a local gradient update on its local dataset. Second, a central server collects and aggregates the updates from the clients, updates the global model, and transmits it to the clients. The iterative procedure is carried out until convergence.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Implementation of federated learning in MEC networks suffers from some fundamental bottlenecks. The heterogeneity of compute and communication resources across clients makes the client selection a difficult task as the overall gradient aggregation at the MEC server can be significantly delayed by the straggling computations and communication links (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Coded Computing for Low-Latency Federated Learning over Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Additionally, federated learning suffers from wireless link failures during transmission. Re-transmission of messages can be done for failed communications, but it may drastically prolong the training time. Furthermore, the data distribution across clients in MEC networks is non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed), i.e. data stored locally on a device does not represent the population distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Thus, missing out updates from clients leads to poor convergence.</p>

In the following, we summarize the key aspects of our proposal.</p>

Particularly, for distributed linear regression, we propose to generate masked parity data locally at each client at the start of the training procedure, by taking linear combinations of features and labels in the local dataset. The encoding coefficients are locally generated by the clients, and along with the raw client data, the encoding coefficients are not shared with the server. The local parity datasets are shared with the server, which aggregates them to obtain the composite global parity dataset. During training, the central server obtains the coded gradient by computing the gradient over the global parity data, which compensates for the erased or delayed parameter updates from the straggling clients. The combination of coded gradient computed by the MEC server and the uncoded gradients from the non-straggling clients stochastically approximates the full gradient over the entire dataset available at the clients, thus mitigating the convergence issues arising due to missing out updates from clients when data is non-IID.</p>

We provide an analytical and tractable approach for efficiently finding the coding redundancy and load allocation that optimizes the deadline time. Our approach is based on solving a key subproblem, which can be cast as a piece-wise convex optimization problem with bounded domain and hence can be solved efficiently using standard convex optimization tools. We also derive the unique closed form solution for this subproblem for a special case in which the communication links are fully reliable with adequate error protection coding, thus covering the special case of the AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel.</p>

A common system approach for straggler mitigation in distributed computing has been the introduction of some form of task replication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Recently, coded computing strategies have been developed for injecting computation redundancy in unorthodox encoded forms to efficiently deal with communication bottleneck and system disturbances like stragglers, outages and node failures in distributed systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Particularly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed to use erasure coding for speeding up distributed matrix multiplication and linear regression tasks. Coding for heterogeneous distributed matrix multiplication is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which developed an analytical method to calculate near-optimal coding redundancy. However, the entire data needs to be centrally encoded by the central server before assigning portions to compute devices. Reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a coding method over gradients for synchronous gradient descent, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed to encode over the data for avoiding the impact of stragglers for linear regression tasks.
Many other works on coded computing for straggler mitigation in distributed learning have been proposed in the recent past <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In all these works, the data placement and coding strategy is orchestrated by a central server. As a result, these works are not applicable in the federated learning setting, where the data is privately owned by the clients and cannot be shared with a central server. Our proposed coded computing framework, CodedFedL, provides a novel solution for leveraging coding redundancy for straggler resilient federated learning.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Prior works that have considered one or more aspects of compute, communication and statistical heterogeneity across clients in federated learning include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, a FedProx algorithm was proposed to address non-IID data across clients. However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> did not consider variability of compute and communication capabilities across clients. Reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposed FEDL algorithm for allocating radio resources to clients for reducing convergence time. However, we consider the MEC setting with personalized devices where the compute and communication resources of the clients cannot be tuned. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, important clients are selected based on compute and communication delays as well as importance of data in each round of training. In contrast, we optimize load allocation and coding redundancy only once at the start of training. Furthermore, these works do not leverage the computing capability of the MEC server. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a cooperative mechanism in which a fraction of clients share potentially all of their raw data with the server, which carries out gradient computations and includes them in model updates to mitigate statistical heterogeneity. However, sharing potentially all of the raw data from even a fraction of clients may not be feasible in the privacy sensitive federated learning paradigm. Additionally, the success of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> depends on whether the clients that agree to share their raw data with the server adequately represent all the classes. This may not be practical as clients owning a certain type of data (such as users suffering from certain diseases) may not agree to participate in sharing of raw data. In CodedFedL, the server obtains a global parity dataset at the start of training via distributed encoding across client data, as each client privately encodes over its local dataset. In each training round, the server computes a coded gradient over the parity dataset that allows the central server to mitigate the impact of straggling nodes during training by stochastically approximating the gradient over the entire dataset across the clients.</p>

A common practice in large-scale distributed learning is to perform training using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD), wherein the local dataset is first sorted and partitioned into mini-batches. Then, in each training iteration, each client computes gradient over a local mini-batch selected sequentially, and the model update is based on the gradient over the global mini-batch obtained by aggregating the gradients over the local mini-batches across clients. We consider the same mini-batch implementation for the uncoded schemes (as we describe in the next paragraph), while for CodedFedL, the data allocation, encoding and training modules are based on each global mini-batch. We assign equal number of data points to each client and use a global mini-batch size of <math id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m{=}12000" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">m</mi><mo id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">12000</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑚</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">12000</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p2.2.m2.1c">m{=}12000</annotation></semantics></math>.

Additionally, as highlighted by the inner figures in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Simulation Setting ‣ V Numerical Experiments ‣ Coded Computing for Low-Latency Federated Learning over Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(a)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ V-A Simulation Setting ‣ V Numerical Experiments ‣ Coded Computing for Low-Latency Federated Learning over Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a>, the initial time spent in uploading the coded data to the server generally increases with increased coding redundancy. However, the gain in training time accumulates across training iterations and the impact of this overhead becomes negligible. Furthermore, Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V-A Simulation Setting ‣ V Numerical Experiments ‣ Coded Computing for Low-Latency Federated Learning over Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(a)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F5.sf1" title="In Figure 5 ‣ V-A Simulation Setting ‣ V Numerical Experiments ‣ Coded Computing for Low-Latency Federated Learning over Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5(a)</span></a> illustrate that for the same number of training iterations, CodedFedL achieves a similar generalization accuracy as the naive uncoded scheme even over a large range of coding redundancy.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose CodedFedL, which is the first coding theoretic framework for straggler resilient federated learning in multi-access edge computing networks with general non-linear regression and classification tasks and non-IID data across clients. As a key component, we propose distributed kernel embedding of raw features at clients using a common pseudo-random seed across clients so that they can obtain the kernel features without having to collaborate with each other. In addition to transforming the non-linear federated learning problem into computationally favourable distributed linear regression, kernel embedding enables our novel distributed encoding strategy that generates global parity data for straggler mitigation. The parity data allows the central server to perform gradient computations that substitute or replace missing gradient updates from straggling client devices, thus clipping the tail behavior of gradient aggregation and significantly improving the convergence performance when data is non-IID. Furthermore, there is no decoding of partial gradients required at the central server. We provide an analytical solution for load allocation and coding redundancy computation for obtaining the optimal deadline time, by utilizing statistical knowledge of compute and communication delays of the MEC nodes. Additionally, we provide privacy analysis of generating local parity datasets, and analyze convergence performance of CodedFedL under simplifying assumptions. Finally, we provide results from numerical experiments over benchmark datasets and practical network parameters that demonstrate gains of up to <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="15\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">15</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">15\times</annotation></semantics></math> in the wall-clock training time over benchmark schemes.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.2" class="ltx_p">CodedFedL opens up many interesting future directions. As the global parity dataset is obtained by the MEC server by aggregating the local parity datasets from the clients, the encoded data of each client can be further anonymized by using secure aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, so that the server gets to know only the global parity dataset, without knowing any individual local parity dataset.

Exploring and characterizing this aspect of privacy is left for future study. Furthermore, the problem of characterizing the complete impact of the encoding matrix on convergence and optimizing the deadline time based on convergence criteria will be addressed in future work. Additionally, formulating and studying the load optimization problem based on outage probability for aggregate return is an interesting future work. Adapting CodedFedL to scenarios when the datasets at the clients are changing over time is a motivating future direction as well. Moreover, establishing theoretical foundations of combining coding with random Fourier feature mapping is of significant interest. Another important extension of CodedFedL is to develop coded computing solutions for federated learning for neural network workloads.</p>
