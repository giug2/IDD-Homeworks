<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">In order to detect and correct physical exercises, a Grow-When-Required Network (GWR) with recurrent connections, episodic memory and a novel subnode mechanism is developed in order to learn spatiotemporal relationships of body movements and poses. Once an exercise is performed, the information of pose and movement per frame is stored in the GWR. For every frame, the current pose and motion pair is compared against a predicted output of the GWR, allowing for feedback not only on the pose but also on the velocity of the motion. In a practical scenario, a physical exercise is performed by an expert like a physiotherapist and then used as a reference for a humanoid robot like Pepper to give feedback on a patient’s execution of the same exercise. Since the humanoid robot is mobile, it can be employed in different environments. This approach, however, comes with two challenges. First, the distance from the humanoid robot and the position of the user in the camera’s view of the humanoid robot have to be considered by the GWR as well, requiring a robustness against the user’s positioning in the field of view of the humanoid robot. Second, since both the pose and motion are dependent on the body measurements of the original performer, the expert’s exercise cannot be easily used as a reference. This paper tackles the first challenge by designing an architecture that allows for tolerances in translation and rotations regarding the center of the field of view. For the second challenge, we allow the GWR to grow online on incremental data. In order to support multiple persons, catastrophic forgetting has to be closely monitored and evaluated. For evaluation, we developed a new synthetic dataset methodology and created a novel exercise dataset with virtual avatars called the Virtual-Squat dataset. Overall, we claim that our novel architecture based on the GWR can use a learned exercise reference for different body variations through continual online learning, while preventing catastrophic forgetting, enabling for an engaging long-term human-robot interaction with a humanoid robot.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A lack of physical exercise is directly linked to many health issues including obesity, cardiovascular diseases as well as depression and anxiety <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Booth et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. Therefore, physical activities are required for a healthy lifestyle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fen and Hong, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>. However, performing physical exercises without proper techniques can lead to injuries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gray and Finch, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. As a consequence, supervision by a personal trainer or physiotherapist is of utter importance for people who are unfamiliar with performing physical exercises. Fitness professionals do not only prevent injuries by preventing incorrect techniques, but also increase the effects of the exercise by pushing clients closer to their limits and thereby increasing the overall exercise intensity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(De Lyon et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Despite the benefits, for some people booking a personal trainer is no possibility or a physiotherapist is not available. Therefore, the question arises whether a humanoid robot can act in a supportive manner for fitness professionals to encourage clients to exercise. In order to provide a basic service, the humanoid robot is required to correct improper technique and engage with its user. Thus, the humanoid robot must be able to detect pose and movement of a user and compare it to a learned exercise recalled from memory in order to provide feedback. This requirement comes with multiple challenges. First of all, the humanoid robot should be able to learn an exercise and its corresponding pose and movement pattern. Therefore, the memory cannot be fixed beforehand and has to be expandable. Secondly, the learned sequence of pose and movements of an exercise provided by the initial training might mismatch with the current user’s body shape. As a consequence, the memory has to be updated continuously for every new user while maintaining all previous information. So, the proposed architecture has to counteract catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the humanoid robot has to provide feedback that is valuable, engaging and easy to understand for the user.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle these challenges, for one, OpenPose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cao et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is utilized as the pose estimation framework. Secondly, for memory and learning, a Grow-When-Required Network (GWR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Marsland et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>)</cite> with recurrent connection is used. Finally, due to its humanoid form and its tablet as an easy tool for visual feedback, Pepper is selected as the robot. The resulting novelty of this work is twofold. For one, the recurrent variant of the GWR, called Gamma-GWR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Parisi et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, is extended in order to counteract catastrophic forgetting and to store many different variations of body shapes for a pose. We call this network Subnode-GWR. For evaluation, we created a novel exercise dataset based on virtual avatars with differing body shapes on which we are able to achieve an average accuracy of <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="88\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">88</mn><mo id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">88</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">88\%</annotation></semantics></math> with robustness against rotation and translation.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One can cluster pose trainers into two categories: camera-based or sensor-based. Then, again, both approaches can be fanned out into RGB-D, which is a color image with depth information, or solely RGB for camera-based methods and into classical sensors, e. g., motion sensors and medical systems like electroencephalograms (EEG) or electromyography (EMG) for sensor-based methods. Together with support-vector machines (SVM) proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cortes and Vapnik (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>)</cite> as a classifier, EEG has been used by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang et al.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For camera-based methods, many approaches in the health domain make use of the infrared camera Microsoft Kinect. One of its main advantages is its integrated pose estimation. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ukita et al.

</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zheng et al. (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, in general, human pose estimation is split up into 2D and 3D pose estimation. In 2D human pose estimation, key points that correspond to the two-dimensional spatial location of each joint in an image are extracted, whereas in 3D estimation also depth information is retrieved. In a next step, one can distinguish between single-person and multi-person detection in the 2D domain. The two mainly used deep learning methods for single person detection are regression and body part detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zheng et al., <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. In regression approaches, the pipeline takes an image as an input and outputs key points in an end-to-end manner. Therefore, a direct mapping from the input image to the 2D pose is learned. For body part detection, the pipeline consists of two steps. First, for each body part a heatmap that indicates the probability for a key point to match the individual joint location is created. In a second step, the key points and the corresponding body parts are put in relation to each other and the overall pose is generated. The shift from traditional approaches in human pose estimation towards deep learning was pushed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Toshev and Szegedy (<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> and their multi-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) regressor DeepPose. Since then, human pose estimation frameworks have improved steadily and most of today’s best-performing architectures are based on the body part detection approach. In contrast to single person estimation, multi-person pose estimation faces the challenge of having multiple key points for one joint type that have to be matched to the correct person. Therefore, the idea quickly raised to use a person or object detector like YOLO by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Redmon et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> first in order to receive cropped images where just one person is visible and apply one of the single-person methods. However, this comes with a major drawback, since the accuracy of the human pose estimation depends heavily on the performance of the involved person or object detector. As a solution, bottom-up methods have been developed. One of them is called OpenPose by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. As an architecture, it consists of two multi-stage CNNs. For preprocessing, a VGG convolutional network, originally developed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Simonyan and Zisserman (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> extracts the features of the inputted image. From these feature maps, the first CNN in an OpenPose architecture computes so-called part affinity field maps (PAFs), that indicate the connection between the joints to form the body part. These PAFs together with the original image features from VGG19 are used in a second CNN to compute the joint locations for each body part. Finally, these heatmaps are used to match the body parts to the correct person in the scene by applying bipartite matching. The pose estimation is superposed on the original image as a skeleton figure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In general, convolutional neural networks are a powerful tool for pose estimation, as e. g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kamel et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> show, who designed a convolutional neural network to provide real-time feedback on Tai Chi poses. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> propose a framework that gives a metric for quantifying movement performance. They also introduce scoring functions which map the metric into numerical scores of movement quality. To achieve this, a deep neural network is developed, which generates quality scores for inputted movements. The neural network receives the joint coordinates as its input that is split into multiple individual body parts and their joint coordinates. The input data for each body part is arranged into temporal pyramids, where multiple scaled versions of the movement repetitions are processed with 1D convolutions and concatenated. Then, the concatenated output is fed into a series of LSTM layers in order to model temporal correlations in learned representations. Finally, a linear layer outputs a movement quality score. Another smart coach proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zou et al. (<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> uses the regional multi-person pose estimation (RMPE) framework developed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> to extract poses from video to generate feedback on the physical exercise performance of users. Recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ota et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> verify OpenPose reliability and accuracy on motion analysis for bilateral squats. Therefore, we select OpenPose as our framework to use, since we also analyze a variation of squats as described in section <a href="#S4" title="4 Experiments on Subnode-GWR Performance and Robustness ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Furthermore, it allows the usage of the humanoid robot Pepper with its built-in RGB camera without requiring an additional depth camera, which increases the usability of our approach. However, as aforementioned in section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the problem still arises how to adapt to different body sizes and variations that significantly mismatch with the trained-on key points. As a solution, we develop continual learning schemes for our architecture, that allow for adaption to unknown body shapes.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Continual Learning</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Continual learning, also referred to as lifelong learning, is deeply integrated into the learning of humans, such that they develop their cognitive and motoric skills based on novel experiences and repetition of already acquired knowledge over their lifespan (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Parisi et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> for a review). Herein also lies the main challenge of continual learning: catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting describes the process where previously learned tasks or information are overwritten by novel knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McClelland et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>)</cite>. This issue finds itself also in the human brain, where it is expressed as a stability-plasticity dilemma <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mermillod et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>. The neural structure in brain areas have to be able to change in order to integrate new information while keeping already acquired knowledge intact. This neurosynaptic plasticity is essential for human learning and is at its highest during early development, where the input is dominated by novel sensorimotor experiences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Parisi et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. While the brain stays plastic over a lifetime, it becomes less prominent over time when stable neural connections have been established <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hensch et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite>. The underlying mechanism for controlling the plasticity and stability are based on the presynaptic and postsynaptic strength, which was discovered by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hebb (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">1949</a>)</cite>. As soon as one neuron is excited by an external stimulus, it activates neurons connected to it. The degree of activation depends on the connection’s strength that is updated based on the presynaptic and post-synaptic activity. While Hebbian plasticity is the basis for neurosynaptic adaptation, the complementary learning system (CLS) theory articulated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McClelland et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>)</cite> is the scheme that drives the learning and memorization process. The hippocampus acts as an episodic memory that is highly plastic and therefore learns fast. On the other hand, the neocortex learns slowly and as a consequence acts as a long-term storage for information. In order to store knowledge and counteract catastrophic forgetting, the structure of the neocortex only changes after receiving similar input over a longer time span. Therefore, the hippocampus replays episodic events to the neocortex, which will incorporate the knowledge given the repeating activation of similar structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It comes with no surprise that these brain mechanisms have been implemented in lifelong machine learning approaches. One basic approach stems from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kohonen (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">1990</a>)</cite> and is called a self-organizing map (SOM). It has fixed structures consisting of nodes that represent neurons in the brain. To each node, a weight is assigned that defines its place in the input space and therefore also in the lattice of the self-organizing map. This lattice is trained by finding the best-matching node with the least distance to an input sample. The weight is updated according to the difference between the input sample and the node’s distance. Also, neighboring node weights that are connected to the best-matching node are updated. As a consequence, the lattice of the self-organizing map deforms until the average distance to all input samples is minimized. However, since self-organizing maps are fixed in their number of nodes and thus in their dimensions, they are not suitable for multitask challenges in the lifelong learning context. Therefore, self-organizing maps have been extended by, e. g., Growing Neural Gases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fritzke, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">1995</a>)</cite>. They allow for nodes to be deleted and added. The addition of nodes though occurs after a fixed amount of iterations, which forbids a dynamic growth based on the need for new nodes to represent the input space.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Grow-When-Required (GWR) networks by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Marsland et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>)</cite> overcome this issue by allowing nodes to be added dynamically whenever the best-matching node’s activity is lower than a predefined threshold. While Grow-When-Required networks are able to learn static input, they lack the possibility to store temporal information between the input samples. Therefore, recurrences are introduced in the Gamma-GWR from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Parisi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> as context vectors that are additionally stored for every node. They are based on the ideas of the Merge SOM architecture proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Strickert and Hammer (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>, where context descriptors capture the activity of the self-organizing map for a given time step. As a consequence, the distant function of the Gamma-GWR not only depends on the weights of a node but also on its context that is based on the activation of previous time steps. Thus, time sequences can be incorporated in the structure of the Gamma-GWR allowing to learn, e. g., spatiotemporal sequences. To this comes the caveat that the input sample in every time step has to be unique, since otherwise nodes link to themselves, which results in a loop for the time sequence. This is not an issue with the Episodic-GWR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Parisi et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> that directly stores the predecessor of a node and does not allow for a node to be its own predecessor. This leads to a loss of information for a time sequence, e. g., a physical exercise where a pose has to be held for a longer period of time, which is why we extend this approach with our Subnode-GWR.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our design, the humanoid robot Pepper from Softbank Robotics acts as a motivator and trainer for the user performing a physical exercise, which is demonstrated in figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Pepper has been designed for human-robot interaction especially, featuring built-in speech and face recognition through their NAOqi-API. In its head, microphones, speakers and cameras are installed and it can move on wheels that are integrated in its triangular base with multiple environment sensors for navigation. Pepper is equipped with tactile sensors in its hands and head. Overall, 17 joints can be manipulated for expressive gestures and visual feedback can be given on its tablet that is mounted on its chest. While Pepper in its core is designed as a humanoid robot, it has no explicit gender, which is also expressed in Pepper’s androgynous voice. When using it for different clients, this is advantageous as studies show that persons are biased towards robots expressing a gender <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Siegel et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>; Tay et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use Pepper’s tablet to mirror the real-time video feed from Pepper’s camera in its head. To do so, the video feed from the camera is streamed to a computer, where it is processed by OpenPose in real-time. The extracted key points are drawn as a skeleton figure on the frame. We also embed the visual feedback into this skeleton figure. Therefore, we compare the difference in the joint’s key points between the estimation from OpenPose and the stored information in our Subnode-GWR per video frame. If the error is larger than a predefined threshold, we render the corresponding joint in the skeleton as red, indicating that the current joint’s position is wrong. Otherwise, the joint is drawn in green reflecting the correct positioning of the joint. We stream the frame with the user and the superposed skeleton figure to a local web server, that can be accessed by Pepper, which is then displayed on its tablet, giving real-time, intuitive and supportive feedback to the user in front of the Pepper robot. The scenario is shown in figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, Pepper should react accordingly with verbal and gestural feedback, e. g., praising the user if he/she has performed well, hinting at possible areas of improvement if there is a dominant issue and motivating the user to continue exercising. For gestural feedback, Pepper’s movement should be restricted to its arms and hands. This is due to the fact, that we record the user in front of Pepper through the integrated camera in its head and need to minimize Pepper’s head movement. In order to correctly process the poses trained on and embedded in the Subnode-GWR, the user is asked by the Pepper to position him-/herself in the camera’s field of view such that no key points are cut off. Hence, the real-time estimation by OpenPose is shown on Pepper’s tablet, making it clearly visible to the user whether he/she is positioned accurately. On top of that, we expect that our Subnode-GWR works within a tolerance of 5 degrees in rotation and 5 centimeters in translation, which we evaluate in section <a href="#S4" title="4 Experiments on Subnode-GWR Performance and Robustness ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.53" class="ltx_p">There are two advantages to this approach. On the one hand, since Gamma-GWRs solely rely on context to determine a node’s successor, they tend to loop in their prediction if a node references to itself. On the other hand, Episodic-GWRs, according to equation <a href="#S3.E8" title="In 3.2 Subnode-GWR ‣ 3 Physical Exercise Scenario with a Humanoid Robot ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, forbid nodes to be their own successor at all. This limits the capability of the network to learn physical exercises that require to hold a pose for some frames. These issues are resolved by the modifications described in equation <a href="#S3.E9" title="In 3.2 Subnode-GWR ‣ 3 Physical Exercise Scenario with a Humanoid Robot ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, which allow for nodes to precede themselves without looping and thus making it possible to store physical exercises, where one pose spans over a longer time frame. The complete algorithm is also depicted in algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.2 Subnode-GWR ‣ 3 Physical Exercise Scenario with a Humanoid Robot ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the physical exercise, we selected a squat where, instead of keeping the arms straight in front of the body as is typical for this exercise, we opted for side arm raises. The selected exercise offers multiple advantages. First of all, for the user him-/herself, this movement strains muscles that are required for essential daily activities, e. g., lifting and sitting as well as sports movements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Myer et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. Secondly, it is challenging for human pose estimation, since all joints are moved. Thirdly, it is a cycling exercise with two halting points (standing upright, sitting down), which is demanding on the pose prediction (see figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.1 Motion Prediction With Gamma-GWR ‣ 4 Experiments on Subnode-GWR Performance and Robustness ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). Finally, the camera view is monocular and the pose estimation two-dimensional. Therefore, the camera cannot capture the physical exercise extending into the depth while squatting down, increasing the difficulty.</p>

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Each avatar is repeating the same exercise (squat) in one correct and five incorrect ways. The squat exercise was animated by hand using a video recording of a correctly performed exercise. The five incorrect executions model frequent errors during the exercise. Correct and incorrect exercises were then applied as animations for the ten avatars, which is illustrated in figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4 Experiments on Subnode-GWR Performance and Robustness ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Note that the virtual avatars offer the benefit of creating incorrect exercise executions, which could be harmful to real persons and cannot be recorded with participants. Each exercise is recorded over 100 frames in 480x320 resolution (Pepper’s camera resolution) using the Cycles rendering engine. Furthermore, to simulate imperfect alignment between Pepper and its interaction partner, each execution of the exercise was recorded in four different ways: 1) with the avatar centered in the image and facing straight ahead; 2) with the avatar rotated by 5 degrees clockwise; 3) with the avatar translated by 5 centimeters to the left and 4) with the avatar both rotated and translated. In total, the dataset contains 10 different avatars performing 6 different exercise executions with 4 different rotations and translations, which equals 240 exercise videos.</p>

Therefore, we assume that the Gamma-GWR gets stuck in a loop of a self-referencing node and thus, cannot predict the upward motion. This also explains the similarity between 50 and 100 predictions, since in both cases, the predictions halts at the same stage of the physical exercise. As a consequence, the question arises, whether a mechanism for recalling a trajectory of BMUs as in the Subnode-GWR and the Episodic-GWR, which does not employ a prediction scheme based on computation but rather on a look-up table, performs better.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With an average error of 1.726, the Subnode-GWR performs best, with the Episodic-GWR ranking second with 1.975, leaving the Gamma-GWR behind with 2.885. The results show that the prediction algorithm of the Gamma-GWR lacks behind the approach of the Episodic-GWR. In figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Comparison Between GWR Variants ‣ 4 Experiments on Subnode-GWR Performance and Robustness ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, however, it becomes obvious that disallowing nodes to reference to themselves leads to asynchronous predictions.

Therefore, the predicted blue skeleton performs the exercise faster than the virtual avatar. This issue is overcome by the Subnode-GWR, which triggers no erroneous feedback according to figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Comparison Between GWR Variants ‣ 4 Experiments on Subnode-GWR Performance and Robustness ‣ Continual Learning from Synthetic Data for a Humanoid Exercise Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, distinguishing the Subnode-GWR as the best approach for the task at hand. Though, while it performs well on virtual avatar 01, on which it has been trained on, the Subnode-GWRs novelty lies in its continual learning scheme, which is evaluated in a third experiment.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Physical exercise is a precondition for a healthy lifestyle, but requires proper technique in order to prevent injuries. To support on this matter, we employed the humanoid robot Pepper as a motivator and feedback giver and developed the GWR algorithm with subnodes and a continual learning scheme, which we call Subnode-GWR. While the proposed architecture works well within its purpose, there are still caveats that can be improved. For one, the Subnode-GWR tackles catastrophic forgetting by increasing the capacity of the network rather than restructuring knowledge. This is of course a drawback of the Grow-When-Required approach itself, which has not been solved yet and requires future work. Secondly, the Subnode-GWR requires carefully monitored input from a supervisor (e. g. a physiotherapist) during the learning phase, since its adaptivity is limited within a range of tolerance, that has to be tuned manually. Here, future work could improve on the adaption process, making it self-sustained, not requiring for additional supervision. Still, we evaluated the Subnode-GWR against already existing GWR variants (Gamma-GWR and Episodic-GWR) and showed the advantages of it. We also examined in further experiments the capabilities of the Subnode-GWR regarding continual learning on multiple avatars and the robustness against rotation and translation. To do so, we recorded the Virtual-Squat dataset with 10 virtual avatars that allow for an evaluation without human participants. Finally, we also see the usage of the Subnode-GWR not limited to its current application, but it can rather be beneficial in cases where a robust and precise replay of information, e. g., as an episodic memory, is required.</p>
