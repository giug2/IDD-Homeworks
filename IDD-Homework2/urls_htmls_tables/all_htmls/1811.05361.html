Estimation of name popularity can leverage personal name matching in databases and be of interest for many other domains.
A distinctive feature of large collections of names is that they contain a large number of unique items, which is challenging for statistical modeling. We investigate a number of statistical techniques and also propose a simple yet effective method aimed at obtaining more accurate count estimates. In our experiments we use a dataset containing about 20 million name occurrences that correspond to about 13 million real-world persons. We perform a thorough evaluation of the name count estimation methods and a record linkage experiment guided by name popularity estimates. Obtained results suggest that theoretically informed approaches outperform simple heuristics and can be useful in a variety of applications.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our study deals with a fairly simply formulated problem – given a full name, how to estimate the number of people bearing this particular name in a large population? Originally, the study was motivated by an applied record linkage task in a large database, where occurrences of personal names were accompanied with no or only scarce additional information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Record linkage – the task of matching records referring to the same real-world entity – is a well-studied field within database technology that is also known under such names as <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">name matching</span>, <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">entity resolution</span>, <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">object identification</span>, <span id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">deduplication</span>, and others.
The task arises when several databases are merged or one is interested in linking duplicate records within a single database. Records referring to people are the most common objects of linkage task. There is a wide variety of application domains, such as social network profiles, medical and census data processing, human resources and customer relationship management, bibliographic and genealogy databases, etc. Discrepancy in data can occur due to different attribute sets, as well as on individual fields’ level due to misspellings and OCR errors, name (cf. nicknames) and transliteration variations.
In contrast, in our settings there is no additional information but <span id="S1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">identical</span> names. Name popularity estimates can serve as an additional signal for matching in case of limited information.
In our study we use a large dataset of open government data that gave rise to the applied task initially. The dataset contains about 20 million records that correspond to 13.4 million real-word persons, which constitutes about one tenth of the entire Russian population. Russia is a multi-ethnic country and we may hope that methods described herein are not heavily dependent on language and culture and can be applied to other name collections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Accurate name popularity estimation based on limited number of observations is a hard task. Even very large collections contain many unique names – names are a good example of <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">large number of rare events (LNRE)</span> distributions. It is quite natural – names serve primarily to distinguish people and to avoid collisions. Therefore maximum likelihood estimates based even on large name samples are poor predictors, since there are always many unseen names. A simplistic assumption that all names are unique may work in small communities, but in larger populations one can observe a whole spectrum from singletons to very common names.
To address the problem we employ several smoothing techniques that redistribute probability mass from already seen names towards yet unseen ones. In addition, we use the fact that first, middle and last names are dependent on each other. We use LNRE models to estimate the number of unique names and use this estimate as smoothing parameter. In case of full name triples (first, middle, and last name) we apply Markov assumption, i.e use only pairwise conditional probabilities. We also propose our simple yet effective technique for name count estimates that takes into account the large number of unique names.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We conducted two experiments: 1) name popularity estimation and 2) record linkage guided solely by the name popularity estimates. We performed evaluation both for name triples (first, middle, and last) and doubles (first and last). Obtained results suggest that theoretically informed approaches outperform simple heuristics. Name popularity estimates can be a good supplemental signal in record linkage tasks, help distinguish unrealistic (artificial), rare and more common names. The main contribution of our study is a thorough comparative evaluation of several statistical techniques applied to the name popularity estimation task on a sizable dataset.
The study provides guidance for choosing the most appropriate model depending on available data, task, and performance requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Knowing an estimate of people bearing a particular name is beneficial not only for record linkage in databases, but also for social network analysis (especially in detecting fake and duplicate accounts<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Facebook estimated that duplicate and fraudulent accounts represented up to 14% of its worldwide monthly active users in the fourth quarter of 2017, see <a target="_blank" href="https://investor.fb.com/financials/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=12512043" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://investor.fb.com/financials/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=12512043</a></span></span></span>), people search, information security, and information extraction. Quantitative analysis of personal names is also of interest for genealogy, demographic, sociological, and human biology research. Last but not least, name popularity estimates can be helpful in such an important matter as the choice of the name for a newborn baby.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our study is close to personal name matching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, a special case of <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">record linkage</span> – the task of matching records referring to the same real-world person in the presence of errors, spelling variants, omissions, abbreviation, etc. Most name matching method rely on pre-defined or machine-learned similarity measures for field values and tuples, see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The main difference of our study is that we deal with <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">identical</span> names and no additional fields. Our approach is close to record linkage methods that use conditional probabilities for field values (see, for example, an early work by Winkler <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>). However, we do not adjust our methods to a particular database; we rather aim at modeling name popularity at a global scale. As such, name popularity models can deliver additional evidence for record linkage tasks applied to different databases and in case of scarce additional information.
Personal name matching and deduplication attract a great deal of attention. For example, 238 teams participated in the Author Disambiguation Challenge in 2013.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2013-author-disambiguation/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2013-author-disambiguation/</a></span></span></span> The task was to identify which authors in a large bibliographic database correspond to the same person. The winning solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> used string similarity measures and an ensemble classifier for two concurrent matcher implementations, as well as processed Chinese and non-Chinese names separately.

These studies are relevant to ours since the central notion in both approaches is username uniqueness. The latter study models username unexpectedness with character-level Markov model. The authors of the former study first perform username segmentation; then estimate rareness or commonness of a segmented username using web n-gram statistics.

The registry contains about 32 million name mentions. Minimal piece of information about a person is his or her full name. Full names in Russian official documents are triples comprising of first, middle (patronymic), and last names, for example, <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin</span>.

The first model (I) is a naïve “always 1” baseline that assumes all names are unique. Obviously, the model performs ideally on hapaxes.
MLE model for full name triples (II) demonstrates the best prediction results in higher frequency ranges. The product of individual probabilities for first, middle and last names (III) performs slightly better on hapaxes, but substantially underestimates the probability of more frequent names. We investigated different dependencies between full name constituents, and combination in the model IV performed best. As one can see, conditional probabilities considerably improve over model III that assumes independence of name constituents.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our experiments we make use of a large name dataset with unique identifiers that contains names of approximately one tenth of the Russian population.
We conducted a series of experiments with different name popularity prediction models built upon the name dataset. We thoroughly evaluated several models, including well-known smoothing approaches and proposed a new simple yet effective method for adjusting probability estimates accounting for unseen events. Results show that the considered methods behave differently depending on the frequency range of names to be estimated, the name structure (full name triples vs. first and last name doubles), and the population size for which the prediction is made. These experimental results can serve as guidelines for choosing the most suitable method for a specific task and available data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we conducted a record linkage experiment in the large database based solely on name popularity estimates. The outcomes suggest that name popularity estimates are a valuable signal for personal name matching. Results show that all methods using smoothing perform almost identically and the simplest method based on maximum likelihood estimates can be a good choice, when precision is more important than recall. However, these results reflect the peculiarities of a specific database and serve merely as an illustration of feasibility of the approach.</p>

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed methods are applied to identical name strings and do not account for misspellings, OCR errors, spelling and transliteration variants. An interesting direction for future research could be combination of name popularity estimates and string similarity measure traditionally used in record linkage tasks.</p>
