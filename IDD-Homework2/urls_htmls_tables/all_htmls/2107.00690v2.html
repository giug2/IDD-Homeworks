<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigates how trust, shared understanding between a human operator and a robot, and the Locus of Control (LoC) personality trait, evolve and affect Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in mixed-initiative robotic systems. As such systems become more advanced and able to instigate actions alongside human operators, there is a shift from robots being perceived as a tool to being a team-mate. Hence, the team-oriented human factors investigated in this paper (i.e. trust, shared understanding, and LoC) can play a crucial role in efficient HRI. Here, we present the results from an experiment inspired by a disaster response scenario in which operators remotely controlled a mobile robot in navigation tasks, with either human-initiative or mixed-initiative control, switching dynamically between two different levels of autonomy: teleoperation and autonomous navigation. Evidence suggests that operators trusted and developed an understanding of the robotic systems, especially in mixed-initiative control, where trust and understanding increased over time, as operators became more familiar with the system and more capable of performing the task. Lastly, evidence and insights are presented on how LoC affects HRI.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As robots are increasingly integrated into human-robot teams, it is pertinent to design human-robot systems that facilitate trust, communication and interdependent working. The irony of automation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is that without careful analysis of how autonomous systems (i. e. robots in this context) are introduced and their effect on the work and team, autonomy can reduce situational awareness, decrease attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and increase workload, leaving humans to work through tasks too nuanced for automation, in addition to supervision and validation of the autonomy’s actions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Having the human-in-the-loop to control, supervise, or even with a peer-to-peer relationship with the robotic system, offers a crucial advantage: the benefits of both agents’ capabilities whilst mitigating their weaknesses through collaboration. In remotely-operated robotic systems, robots can keep humans from harm and share workload by conducting tasks remotely and autonomously. Humans can take over in abstract situations requiring contextual, imaginative or moral thinking. Both human-robot team members operate interdependently to solve problems, with work allocation changing dynamically depending on the task. Human operator personality traits, trust in the robot, self-trust, and understanding of the system all can play a role in establishing how the system will be used and relied upon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This paper focuses on team-oriented human factors aspects of remotely operated Human-Initiative (HI) and Mixed-Initiative (MI) robotic systems, in terms of the operator’s trust in the system, shared understanding between the robot and the operator, and the effect the Locus of Control (LoC) personality trait has on HRI. This is done through an empirical study in which human operators conducted a search and rescue navigation task via remotely controlling a realistically simulated mobile robot in either MI or HI control.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The MI and HI systems in our testbed allow for dynamic switching between different Levels of Autonomy (LoA) during task execution. Two different LoAs are used: teleoperation, with an operator manually controlling navigation via a joypad; and autonomy, where the robot autonomously navigates towards human-defined waypoints. In HI control, the human operator is solely responsible for switching LoA based on their judgement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In MI control, both the operator and the robot’s AI have the authority to initiate actions and switch LoA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, meaning the robot is essentially a peer with equal authority. This makes designing HRI uniquely challenging, as transferring control authority fluidly requires communication, trust and shared understanding within the human-robot team.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This paper contributes evidence that MI robotic systems can be appropriately trusted by operators; trust and shared understanding increase over time; and efficient HRI within the MI system is correlated with an operator’s familiarity with the system (i.e. understanding). Additionally, this paper contributes by reporting how LoC affects HRI both in MI and HI control. Evidence suggests that operators with average and high LoC are comfortable giving control of the task to the robot’s AI.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to Chen and Barnes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, the most relevant definition of trust is the one from Lee and See <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>: Trust is <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\say</span>the attitude that an agent will help achieve an individual’s goals in a situation characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability.</p>

Schaefer et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> categorise factors that affect trust into three categories; human-related, automation-related (the robot in the current context), and environment-related. Hancock et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> conducted a meta-analysis of the trust literature and concluded that robot performance-related factors, such as reliability and failure rate, have the largest influence on trust. They argue that more experimental studies on human-related factors are needed. Schaefer et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> meta-analysis on trust further confirms the importance of both automation and human performance-related factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Most recent HRI research suggests that individual differences in trust might stem from whether the robot is perceived as an advanced tool, a human-like teammate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and/or by cultural differences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Robot errors are found to have a profound and lasting effect on trust <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> present a data-based model where trust is either exponentially increasing or decreasing based on the robot’s reliability and initial user expectations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our literature survey found two studies on trust with control modes similar to HI control, but no studies similar to MI control. In Desai et al., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> operators were allowed to switch between fully autonomous and robot-assisted navigation. They found that the effect reduced reliability has on trust becomes less apparent over time. Additionally, when assistance reliability dropped, participants switched to autonomy. Once reliability improved, participants waited longer to switch back to autonomy compared to switching away from autonomy. Nam et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed computational MDP models to predict an operator’s trust levels towards a robotic swarm equipped with a suggestion system regarding LoA switching. They found that the formation shape of the swarm affected trust when task performance was not readily understandable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, although there is a body of literature on trust in autonomous systems, the field of HRI requires more studies that explore trust in scenarios where operators cooperatively perform tasks using remotely controlled variable-autonomy robotic systems. Often, trust in HRI is studied in tasks with a high level of abstraction or theoretical scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>; when using decision aids or recommendation robots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>; or by observing the robotic system conduct a task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is a gap in the literature regarding the empirical investigation of trust in robotic systems where the LoA varies dynamically during task execution. This is especially true for MI robotic systems where the autonomous agent has a peer-to-peer relationship with the operator and can actively take control and change the LoA.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Locus of Control (LoC) is a personality trait and refers to the degree people believe that their actions and behaviours affect outcomes in events in their lives. Simply put, it is the degree of control people believe they have over events. It is usually divided into internal and external LoC. An internal LoC means that a person believes that outcomes and events in their life derive primarily from their own actions and efforts, as they see a causal relationship between their behaviour and rewards. In contrast, an external LoC means that a person believes the outcome of events is mostly affected by forces beyond their control, e.g. luck, fate, powerful others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We hypothesise that due to its nature, LoC affects HRI and consequently performance in systems where the operator needs to cooperate with an autonomous agent to control a remote robot to achieve a task. Despite its potential importance, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is a lack of research considering the operator’s LoC personality trait in human-robot teams. In this paper, we aim to address this gap in the literature by investigating the effect of LoC in HI and MI robotic systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our literature survey found two studies in shared control telepresence robots. Takayama et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> found that people with an internal LoC took longer to complete an obstacle course than people with an external LoC. Although not statistically significant, they also report evidence that autonomous assistance seemed to degrade performance for operators with a very high internal LoC. This might suggest that individuals with a high internal LoC have problems giving up control to an autonomous system. In Acharya et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> average and high internal locus operators have the same level of performance. Additionally, the high internal LoC operators issued the most commands to the robot and had a high percentage of command conflicts. These results suggest this group may seek more control and grow frustrated with the robot’s response.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These studies will be used to inform our discussion better. However, a direct comparison between our work and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> cannot be made. This is because our work uses MI and HI control and not shared control, meaning the operator interacts with the robotic system differently. In our MI and HI control implementation, the system has the capability to switch between different LoAs on-the-fly (i. e. teleoperation and autonomy). In contrast, in shared control, the robot moves according to a scheme for continuously blending control signals from both human and an autonomous agent. Additionally, we use a different LoC scale (i.e. the ICI) as it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> uses the Rotter’s scale <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> uses an abbreviated version of the LoC Questionnaire (LOCQ). However, all three scales are general measures of LoC.</p>

The human-robot system is able to switch between these two LoAs by using two different variable autonomy methods: either Human-Initiative (HI) or Mixed-Initiative (MI) control.</p>

<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The HI control switcher used is detailed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The control switcher allows the operator to switch between different LoAs on-the-fly and at any time by pressing a joypad button. It is based on the ability and authority of a human operator to initiate LoA switches based on their own judgment to perform a task efficiently (e.g. improving task performance or overcoming difficult performance degrading situations). The robot’s autonomous agent does not have any authority to switch LoAs.</p>
</div>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, MI control is defined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> as <span id="S3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\say</span>a collaboration strategy for human-robot teams where humans and robots opportunistically seize (relinquish) initiative from (to) each other as a mission is being executed…. In the current context, MI control refers to the authority of both the robot’s MI control switcher and the operator to initiate LoA switches at any moment. The MI control switcher used was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and uses an expert-guided approach to initiate LoA switches. It assumes the existence of an AI task expert (i.e. a navigation planner in this paper) that given a navigational goal, can provide the expected/ideal task performance for the human-robot system in the absence of performance-degrading factors. The comparison between the system’s run-time performance with the expected expert performance yields an online task effectiveness metric called ”goal-directed motion error”. In essence, this is the difference between the robot’s current motion (i. e. linear velocity) and the motion of the robot required to achieve its goal (i. e. reach a target location) according to the expert planner. Hence, this metric expresses how effectively the system performs the navigation task, and the MI control switcher uses it to infer if a LoA switch is needed. In practice, the MI control switcher parameters were trained to use this error to initiate LoA switches based on what the human operators did to improve performance on data from previous experiments.

Participants practised using either the MI or HI capabilities to switch between LoAs depending on the experimental condition they were allocated. To ensure that all participants had attained a minimum skill level in controlling the robot, they were not allowed to proceed with the experimental trials until they had first demonstrated that they could complete a training obstacle course within a specific time limit, with no collisions, and while presented with the two performance degrading factors.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">H1</span>, the results show that operators trusted the robot’s capabilities to contribute to the task both in HI and in MI, hence confirming <span id="S6.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">H1</span>.

<div id="S6.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In HI, <span id="S6.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">H2</span> evidence suggests that trust in the robot, trust in self, and shared understanding did not change significantly over time, although some non-significant increase can be observed (see Fig. <a href="#S5.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ V Results and Statistical Analysis ‣ Trust, Shared Understanding and Locus of Control in Mixed-Initiative Robotic Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4a</span></a>). This might suggest that the standardised training has provided participants with a close to maximum trust and understanding they could have for the HI system in the context of this experiment. However, the lack of statistically significant evidence could also be because of the relatively small sample size.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In MI, and in contrast with HI, the evidence presented confirms <span id="S6.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">H2</span> and shows that trust and understanding of the system improved over time. This is important evidence pointing towards two directions: reliability of and familiarity with the system. First, in conjunction with the performance increase over time in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, this gives evidence to support the reliability of the MI system in the context of this experiment, backed up by the trust model of Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> which predicts that trust in a robot increases with robot reliability. Additionally, this further contributes to the current literature (see Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="II-A Trust in Automation and Human-Robot Interaction ‣ II Related Work ‣ Trust, Shared Understanding and Locus of Control in Mixed-Initiative Robotic Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-A</span></span></a>) in showing that trust is mainly driven by performance (e.g. reliability). Secondly, this increase in trust and shared understanding may be related to the increased amount of HRI which occurs in MI compared with HI. The interaction in the MI condition is more complex and meaningful when compared to HI, as the robot’s MI control capabilities are more actively involved and perceivable by the operator via the control-switching initiative. This in turn, could have led to increased familiarity with the system over time. An explanation can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>: for trust to grow, humans must be familiar with the system’s operations, methods, and constraints. By understanding the “three Ps” of a system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>; performance, process, and purpose; an operator can develop an appropriate level of trust in a system. Thirdly, a <span id="S6.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\say</span>dip in trust was observed in t4 as three participants rated their trust lower in t4 compared to t3. However, in t5, trust increased again to the highest level across all trials. The authors predict this could have been due to a few negative interactions by chance in t4. The dip in trust was rapidly reconciled in t5.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding <span id="S6.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">EH1</span> in MI, shared understanding was negatively correlated with both the number of operator-initiated LoA switches and the primary task completion time (shorter time means better performance). These results provide evidence that the more an operator understood the MI system, the less they initiated LoA switches and the better they performed. The above evidence explains and adds to the findings in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> in which the total number of LoA switches was decreasing over trials (i.e. time). Additionally, the performance improvement over time in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> suggests that operators become more efficient in LoA switching as they use and understand the system more. Lastly, in MI, the lack of correlation with the use of autonomy LoA might suggest that trust mostly reflects the LoA switching capabilities of the MI control switcher, or the system as a whole, rather than explicitly the autonomy LoA. However, trust and the use of autonomy in both HI and MI conditions were relatively high across participants, and hence a bigger and more diverse sample is required to explore this further.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding <span id="S6.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">EH1</span> in HI, the negative correlation found between self-trust and the perceived workload (i.e. NASA-TLX) means that the more operators trusted themselves and were confident about operating the robot, the lower their perceived workload. This is possibly due to an absence of assistance from the robot in terms of LoA switching. This is further supported by the lack of evidence of such a correlation in MI, in which the robot’s MI control switcher was actively helping with LoA switching and the operators with low self-trust did not experience an increase in workload. This could be because the robot takes some of the burden of control and/or psychologically the active AI role makes operators perceive their workload as less intensive, knowing that the robot’s autonomous agent will take the initiative if they do not perform well. However, the causality can be the other way around as the self-perceived ability to use the robot’s capabilities can be possibly influenced by workload.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The negative correlation in the HI condition between ICI and trust in the robot means operators with highly internal LoC trust the robot less. This differs in the MI condition, where no correlation was found. An explanation for this may be that individuals who score highly on internal LoC consider themselves solely responsible, negatively impacting how likely they are to trust somebody else to accomplish the task and transfer control and therefore, responsibility.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, an autonomous system that can take control as in MI, may be more likely to be perceived as an assistant or collaborator rather than a tool <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In contrast, in HI control, the robot is more likely to be perceived as a tool, as it is unable to interact with the operator actively and must obey their instructions. With no way to experience the more “intelligent” side of the robot, allowing it to assess human performance and take control when necessary, an operator must actively decide to relinquish control. If the operator has a high internal LoC and no way to become familiar with the robot’s reliability, they lack the ability to develop more trust in the robot. This is because trust is based upon familiarity with the robot’s behaviour and this would only be possible through relinquishing control, which goes against their internal LoC.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The absence of correlation evidence between primary task performance and the LoC, both in HI and in MI, is in accordance with the findings of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, that performance between average and high internal LoC operators are indistinguishable.

Hence, <span id="S6.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">EH2</span> in terms of performance cannot be confirmed in the current study.

<div id="S6.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study aimed to be a starting point towards investigating trust, shared understanding, and locus of control in dynamic variable autonomy systems such as HI and MI. Towards this end, in this section, we will provide insights, discuss how to overcome some of the limitations, and provide suggestions for future research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, although we consider the number of participants sufficient to capture some of the trends accurately (e.g. trust increasing in MI over time) it might have prevented us from finding others (e.g. slower increase in trust in HI). Additionally, correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Establishing causation in human factors research can be challenging. Future experiments should include a large number of participants from different age groups and explicitly control for trust, predisposition to robot use, and personality traits so causal relationships can be investigated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Second, due to the complex nature of HRI in MI, there is a need for an MI specialised framework of trust able to capture its multiple dimensions. For example, the current trust measurement does not explicitly differentiate between trust in the robot’s autonomous navigational ability and trust in the robot’s LoA switching capabilities in MI. Future work can tackle this by measuring trust based on momentary interactions (e.g. before and after an MI control switcher initiated changes) and investigating the impact of varying the robot’s navigational reliability on the frequency of LoA switching. Additionally, multidimensional post hoc questionnaires measuring trust in the context of MI should be developed. Once such a framework is validated, it can lead to computational models of trust such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> which can inform the MI system’s LoA switching policies. We consider this a major challenge for the field.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Third, there was no explicit effort to convey trust or make the MI system more transparent to the operator but only follow basic guidelines. Hence, transparency and other factors that affect trust were not explicitly controlled or taken into account. Extensive training mitigated some of these problems by explaining how the system works to the operators and providing them with a basic understanding of the MI algorithm. Future work should explicitly investigate and design interfaces that promote transparency in the MI context. This is a crucial step towards true human-robot teaming.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, similar to other related work, all participants had an average or high internal LoC. This perhaps limits the findings only to those users, excluding those with a high external LoC. A future study should aim to incorporate individuals with a larger variety of LoC, although this is difficult to control for. Another way this could be explored is by studying the LoC of real robot operators, the expectation being they would possess a high level of internal LoC, especially concerning the robot’s control.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presented an empirical investigation of HRI in MI and HI variable autonomy systems in terms of trust in the robot, self-trust, shared understanding between the robot and the operator, and the locus of control personality trait. The evidence presented supports the idea that operators learn to trust (i.e. trust increasing over time) the MI robotic system, and their understanding of the system improves over the course of several interactions in the context of this work. Furthermore, evidence was reported on how LoC affects HRI. Average and high internal LoC operators were found to be comfortable giving control to the robot’s AI for conducting the navigation task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, this work provided insights and highlighted research areas for advancing human factors and HRI w.r.t trust in variable autonomy robotic systems. Of particular importance is developing a framework for measuring the different dimensions of trust, towards computational models of trust, capable of informing MI LoA switching policies.</p>
