<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Radio access network (RAN) slicing is a key element in enabling current 5G networks and next-generation networks to meet the requirements of different services in various verticals. However, the heterogeneous nature of these services’ requirements, along with the limited RAN resources, makes the RAN slicing very complex. Indeed, the challenge that mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) face is to rapidly adapt their RAN slicing strategies to the frequent changes of the environment constraints and service requirements. Machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), are increasingly considered a key enabler for automating the management and orchestration of RAN slicing operations. Nerveless, the ability to generalize DRL models to multiple RAN slicing environments may be limited, due to their strong dependence on the environment data on which they are trained. Federated learning enables MVNOs to leverage more diverse training inputs for DRL without the high cost of collecting this data from different RANs. In this paper, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning approach for RAN slicing. In this approach, MVNOs collaborate to improve the performance of their DRL-based RAN slicing models. Each MVNO trains a DRL model and sends it for aggregation. The aggregated model is then sent back to each MVNO for immediate use and further training. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed DRL approach.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond 5G and 6G are expected to support the explosive growth of data traffic generated by a huge number of connected devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. These devices enable advanced services to multiple vertical industries with diversified quality of service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the traffic volume in these next-generation networks will grow exponentially carrying a huge amount of data. This will increase the demand for bandwidth to provide the connectivity required to transfer this data efficiently and rapidly. Accordingly, these next-generation networks will entail more stringent requirements than current 5G networks. To support all these services, mobile network operators (MNOs) are required to provide an adequate network infrastructure. To achieve this in a high-performance and cost-effective manner, MNOs rely on several cutting-edge technologies, such as network slicing (NS). NS allows the design of several logically independent networks, so-called network slices, which operate on a common physical infrastructure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In particular, radio access network (RAN) slicing consists in partitioning the RAN resources to create various RAN slices, each tailored and dedicated to meet the requirements of a specific service. An MNO owns the physical RAN resources, including radio resources, and leases them to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to deploy RAN slices based on their offered services.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The allocation of radio resources to users is an extremely intricate operation for MVNOs. This is mainly due to the radio resources’ scarcity and the heterogeneous QoS requirements of their services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To overcome these challenges, several efforts have been devoted to formulating such a RAN slicing problem using optimization techniques and solving it with heuristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, these approaches may not align with zero-touch network perspectives since they may be unable to quickly adapt to dynamic and permanent changes in the RAN environment. Machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, can address this issue by bringing more automation to the management of RAN slicing operations. The stochastic RAN environment factors, such as the density of users, user requirements, and wireless channel transmission conditions have a major impact on the accuracy of the DRL models, which decreases the performance of radio resource allocation to the users. Indeed, when an MVNO builds its DRL resource allocation model using training datasets related only to its users’ behavior and its surrounding environment, the accuracy of the DRL model may be limited. To benefit from a diversified dataset, MVNOs could collaborate by sharing their data with each other to provide a diverse and high-quality dataset. However, MVNOs are often competing entities and are unlikely to be willing to share their data for privacy issues. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising alternative to data sharing, as it promotes privacy-preserving collaborative training through sharing model updates instead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a cooperative learning approach in which multiple collaborators, MVNOs in our case, train an ML model using their private datasets, and then send their trained models to an aggregation entity to build a global model. The aggregation entity returns this model to all collaborators for utilization or further training. Thus, FL enables MVNOs to build a robust ML resource allocation model while maintaining data privacy since only trained models are shared. The shared experience will enable the RAN-slicing model to learn from varying scenarios, which makes it more adaptive to the environment changes. In fact, due to the unbalanced and non-independent, and identical distributions (non-i.i.d) of the users across MVNOs, alongside their varying numbers and requirements, FL becomes an attractive solution to build robust models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To implement a FL-based RAN slicing mechanism with a high level of automation and flexibility, Open RAN (for which the O-RAN alliance has built the O-RAN architecture as the foundation for virtualized RAN on open hardware and cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>) emerges as a revolutionary solution. O-RAN relies on openness and intelligence to provide flexible and cost-effective RAN services. Openness refers to the disaggregation of the RAN into several independent functions. Then, the use of open, standardized, and interoperable interfaces to ensure communication between these RAN functions. Thus, the need to use proprietary equipment will be reduced, which leads to more competition among vendors and further innovation. Also, O-RAN promotes the use of more intelligence and automation in controlling the RAN operation through RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). The RICs leverage the capabilities of ML to manage the RAN resources and components such that it becomes a zero-touch network system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The motivation behind this work is to build reliable DRL-based radio resource allocation models for MVNOs by leveraging their heterogeneous and diverse datasets while preserving data privacy and security. Accordingly, we propose an FL-based cooperative radio resource allocation mechanism for MVNOs. In this mechanism, each MVNO trains an DRL radio resource allocation model according to its users’ requirements and sends the trained models to the RIC for aggregation. Then, the RIC sends back the global DRL model to each MVNO to update its local DRL models. The proposed RAN slicing approach is consistent with the zero-touch network framework since it aims to autonomously manage the allocation of radio resources to users by adapting the allocation policy to the constraints of the environment and the requirements of users. Indeed, the use of DRL enables the implementation of a closed-loop control process of the RAN slicing operations. Furthermore, our proposed RAN slicing mechanism is implemented in an O-RAN architecture that favors using more intelligence and automation in monitoring RAN operations.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DRL has been widely used as an efficient tool to perform RAN slicing. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the DRL is used to determine the configuration parameters of the RAN slices. It defines for each RAN slice the transmit power, the bandwidth, the shared bandwidth between the slices and the numerology. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> designs a DRL-based RAN slicing mechanism used by base stations to allocate radio resources to their associated users.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the RAN slicing operation in a multi-MVNOs scenario, various DLR-based efforts have been presented recently. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposes a two-level slicing resource allocation scheme using DRL. Based on the resources received from the MNO, each MVNO allocates to its users the required radio resource to satisfy their QoS. The MVNO uses a DRL algorithm to perform resource allocation to its users in order to maximize their satisfaction rate, which is defined by the number of packets successfully received from the network. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> presents a DRL-based resource allocation algorithm to maximize the utility of MVNOs while meeting QoS requirements of RAN slices. The utility of an MVNO is defined as the gain from allocating the resource to the slice minus the cost of leasing the resource from the MNO.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In all these approaches DRL has been used as an enabler for orchestrating RAN slicing. However, the ability to generalize DRL models to multiple RAN slicing environments may be limited, due to their strong dependence on the environment data on which they are trained. The proposed FDRL-based RAN slicing mechanism overcomes the robustness issue that can arise in approaches based only on DRL. FDRL enables MVNOs to leverage more diverse training inputs for DRL while avoiding to share the data of their RAN environments.</p>

Moreover, if the total sum of the bandwidth fractions is greater than 1, the global action is considered as invalid, and it will be penalized by -0.05. Furthermore, in order to avoid the case where a fraction of the bandwidth is allocated to a user that does not exist, we associate this action to a punishment equal to a negative value that we add to the reward (-0.1).</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">DRL allows to create agents that learn from high-dimensional states, where the policy is represented as a deep neural network. DRL was first introduced through Deep-Q Networks (DQN), and was fast adopted by the research community to solve many practical decision making problems. Nonetheless, DQN is off-policy and may not perform well in environments that have high uncertainties such as wireless networks. While value-based RL algorithms like Q-learning optimize value function first then derive optimal policies, the policy-based methods directly optimize an objective function based on the rewards, which makes them suitable for large or infinite action spaces. Yet, policy-based RL might have noisy and unstable gradients. As a result, we propose to use an actor-critic based algorithm. In fact, actor-critic approaches combine strong points from both value-based and policy-based RL algorithms. Furthermore, since the fraction values are continuous, we use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which concurrently learns a Q-function and a policy and performs actions from a continuous space.</p>

To reduce the correlation between the training samples, DDPG uses the experience replay memory, which stabilizes its behavior. An experience is defined by the current state of the environment, the chosen action, the reward obtained, and the next state of the environment. The agent stores its experiences and then samples random mini-batches from them to train its DQN networks. The exploration policy of DDPG is performed by adding noise to the actions during the training process. The added noise enables the DDPG agent to efficiently explore its environment. We used the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process to generate the noise values.</p>

Moreover, the amount of data collected by each MVNO in certain areas (<span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</span> rural areas) is fairly limited. Since it is beneficial for each MVNO to enhance its bandwidth allocation model, FL has created the opportunity for multiple MVNOs to leverage data from a broader set of users while avoiding sharing it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In this setting, each MVNO trains the bandwidth allocation model using the interaction with its users. Then, the MVNO uploads its locally trained model for the current round to the non-RT RIC. The non-RT RIC performs the aggregation of the models using weighted sum based on each MVNO’s number of users.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The FDRL-based mechanism consists of several communication rounds. Each communication round consists of several local episodes of training, after which the MVNOs update their local models and send the updates to the non-RT RIC.
In each step of the episode, each MVNO observes their local environment, selects an action and receives the corresponding reward. Each transition between two states, <span id="S3.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</span> experience, is stored in the replay buffer. When a predefined number of experiences is stored, MVNOs sample random mini-batches from the replay buffer, and update the different DDPG networks. The actor network is updated through policy gradient and the critic network is updated through loss function minimization. Subsequently, the target networks are updated as well. At the end of the predetermined number of local episodes, each MVNO sends its local updated model to the non-RT RIC for aggregation. The latter collects all the local updates from the MVNOs and generate the global model using a weighted sum.</p>

In this work, we opted for the scenario where the offline training process is hosted in the non-RT RIC and the online inference process is hosted in the near-RT RIC. This choice is related to the proposed FDRL-based RAN slicing mechanism. Indeed, we used a DDPG algorithm, which requires a huge amount of data to perform offline training of RAN slicing models. This offline training requires a resourceful unit with high computing and storage capabilities. Therefore, the non-RT RIC seems better suited to host the offline training of RAN slicing models. The near-RT RIC was chosen as the model inference host since 1) the radio resource allocation operation to users should be performed in a short time scale, and 2) the data needed at the execution time of the RAN slicing operation is available through the E2 interface, which connects the near-RT RIC to the RAN nodes.</p>

Our first observation is that the cumulative rewards for both models are less than what was achieved in the case of equal numbers of users. This is mainly due to the punishment related to allocating bandwidth to non-existent users. Furthermore, similarly to the previous experiments, the global model improves slowly throughout the communication rounds, while the local models do not improve.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we proposed a FDRL RAN slicing mechanism in a multi-MVNOs environment to allocate radio resources to URLLC and eMBB users. We leverage FL to design a RAN slicing mechanism in which MVNOs collaborate to improve their policies for allocating radio resources to their users. We formulated the resource allocation problem for users of each MVNO as a single-agent MDP and used the DDPG algorithm to solve it. Then, FL is used to improve MVNOs’ radio resource allocation models. The proposed FDRL mechanism has proven to be robust in meeting the diverse requirements of URLLC and eMMB users in different scenarios and more resilient to the environment changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the proposed FDRL-based RAN slicing mechanism allows a better robustness of radio resource allocation models, different interesting research directions deserve to be investigated. It is worth studying how to detect and track any deterioration in the performance of DRL models to proactively trigger the retraining process. Another interesting issue to investigate is how to further enhance privacy beyond what federated learning inherently promotes. Indeed, while FL guarantees data privacy to a certain extent, it is still possible for adversaries to infer data from the model updates. To mitigate this, integrating other privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy could be further explored in the case of MNVOs cooperating in FDRL schemes.</p>
