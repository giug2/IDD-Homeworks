<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising way to allow multiple data owners (clients) to collaboratively train machine learning models without compromising data privacy.
Yet, existing FL solutions usually rely on a centralized aggregator for model weight aggregation, while assuming clients are honest.
Even if data privacy can still be preserved, the problem of single-point failure and data poisoning attack from malicious clients remains unresolved.
To tackle this challenge, we propose to use distributed ledger technology (DLT) to achieve
<span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">FLock</span>, a secure and reliable decentralized <span id="id6.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="id6.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning system built on bl<span id="id6.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">ock</span>chain.
To guarantee model quality, we design a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) review and reward/slash mechanism to detect and deter malicious clients, powered by on-chain smart contracts.
The reward/slash mechanism, in addition, serves as incentives for participants to honestly upload and review model parameters in the FLock system.
FLock thus improves the performance and the robustness of FL systems in a fully P2P manner.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is a machine learning (ML) paradigm where data owners/clients collectively train a ML model under the orchestration of a central server, while the clients’ raw data stay local – they are not transferred or shared with any other party. Most FL implementations follow a centralised, ’hub-and-spoke’ topology. The aggregation server distributes global models for clients to train, collects their model updates, then re-distribute updated global model, until training is complete. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Since FL does not involve collecting data from all data services and storing it on a server, it is seen as a promising solution to conduct machine learning while protecting user privacy. Privacy-preserving machine learning has become increasingly valuable due to regulatory restrictions and customer demand. Globally, over <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="70\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">70</mn><mo id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">70</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">70\%</annotation></semantics></math> of countries have introduced regulations on data privacy; in particular, GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> in Europe and HIPAA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> in the US have strict restrictions on what companies can access and store. This has either increased compliance and operations costs, or resulted in companies discontinuing related services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. With FL, companies can analyse data without centralising them first, resulting in simpler compliance procedures and fewer regulatory restrictions. On the other hand, consumers face the dilemma between data protection and functionality. According to a 2021 survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, while two thirds of the customers do not have a positive view on companies’ data protection policies, under <math id="S1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">20</mn><mo id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">20</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1c">20\%</annotation></semantics></math> are happy to share personal information to get additional value such as better services – the rest either do not want to share or consider it as a compromise. FL will bring a much stronger user proposition, one that makes data collection obsolete and does not ask users to choose between privacy and functionality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In conventional FL settings, clients submit local model updates to the central server, which stores and aggregates local updates, before sharing global model updates with the clients back. The central server could become a single point of failure for both the security and the performance of the system, prone to model poisoning, privacy leakage, network delay, and targeted delays.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which acts as an immutable and decentralised ledger, is well-placed to tackle the issue of the server being a central point of failure. There have been several proposed approaches replacing a central server in with a blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A drawback is that these approaches assume that clients do not intend to undermine the global model and can commit resources to staying online and local training. However, there are several ways malicious clients could impair the global model performance. For instance, they could drop out from training, refuse to upload model updates, train models using low-quality or fake data, or just spam the system with random model updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The lack of systematic protection against malicious clients is a limiting factor to FL’s widespread and decentralised adoption, in conventional and on-chain settings. Implementation is thus limited to existing trust circles, where rules of collaboration are more enforceable. To pave the way for large-scale cooperation, we need an automated and enforceable mechanism to ensure execution integrity among participants and protect against malicious attempts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We aim to combine blockchain’s consensus mechanisms with a decentralised scoring mechanism to preserve performance as well as decentralisation. There is no trusted party to authorise which transactions are valid or organise the participants on the blockchain; instead, any party has the opportunity to propose new blocks and the participants are organised by a pre-agreed definition of the canonical record (chain of transactions with the most computation done on it) and an incentive scheme for building on the canonical record (mining rewards). On top of the blockchain, smart contracts allow the execution of arbitrary code or rules, forming a decentralised and distributed machine with shared states among each participating party.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a secure and reliable decentralised Federated Learning system built on blockchain (“FLock”) to reduce the trust in server/other clients required. In addition to on-chain smart contracts replacing the central server in the model aggregation process, there are two main contributions: a reward/slashing mechanism to ensure model performance, and a P2P model evaluation system. Smart contracts provide transparency and ensure there are no side channel attacks from the central server; the reward/slashing mechanism deters data poisoning attacks; and finally, the P2P model evaluation system safeguards model performance and filters out malicious clients in the multi-round setting.</p>

After receiving the local model weight updates from the proposers in this round, the miner selected to produce the block will aggregate the weights via the FedAvg protocol and publish the global model weights on the blockchain.
However, as the miner might be malicious and censor specific proposers to gain benefits, it is crucial for other miners to validate the correctness of model aggregation.
Therefore, after the global model weights are proposed, other miners will start a voting round for the validity of the aggregation results before entering the next step.</p>

To avoid bad model weight updates and punish malicious proposers, an auditing committee is randomly selected among all the eligible participants to evaluate the global model weights.
Each committee voter locally evaluates the model performance on the previous prepared test dataset and calculates a voting score based on the performace.
Afterwards, each voter simply reports the voting score to the blockchain miners for tallying the votes.
An automatic on-chain protocol will determine if the global model weights in this round will be discarded according to the voting scores.

To incentivize honest behaviors and get rid of bad actors, we re-distribute the staked tokens according to the voting scores at the end of each training phase.
For the proposers, the reward/slash is given based on the voting scores.
For the voters, we calculate the amount to reward/slash based on the difference between their individual voting score and the final aggregation score and the voting direction.
We configure the system such that eventually honest participants will get rewards and malicious participants will get slashed.
Since each participant should stake enough tokens to participate, malicious participants will eventually quit the system as their tokens get slashed.
In this way, the FLock system facilitates a secure and truthful federated learning process without sacrificing the final model performance.

It is worth noting that defending against malicious miners is not considered in this work, which already has effective solutions such as FlashBots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
