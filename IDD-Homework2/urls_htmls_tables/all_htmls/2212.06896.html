<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">Many commodity crops have growth stages during which they are particularly vulnerable to stress-induced yield loss. In-season crop progress information is useful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used to track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop progress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on ground truth data for training/calibration. Such data are collected via field trials or surveys. This reliance on ground survey data confines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this study, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in unsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop progress data generated for an unsurveyed region of interest. Corn-growing zones in Argentina were used as surrogate ‘unsurveyed’ regions. These zones have climates and dual planting systems which differ the single planting system in the US Midwest – the surveyed region in this study. Existing weather generation, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to produce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. These data mimic weather, cultivars, and cropping practices in the unsurveyed region. A neural network (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was trained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different combinations of surveyed and synthetic data. In the absence of real validation data in unsurveyed regions, a stopping criterion was developed which uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation loss. F<sub id="id2.2.1" class="ltx_sub">1</sub> score was modified to measure CPE accuracy when trained the NN was trained on each data combination, with scores based on over- and under-estimates of crop progress throughout the season. Including synthetic data during training improved performance in 9 out of 11 corn-growing zones in Argentina. Net F<sub id="id2.2.2" class="ltx_sub">1</sub> scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when trained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall performance was only 21% lower than the best case scenario, when the NN was trained on surveyed data and applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was greatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed region data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI data. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be possible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many commodity crops have critical growth stages during which they are at an increased risk of stress-induced yield loss, such as silking in corn and pod-fill in soybean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Claassen and Shaw, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">1970</a>; Doss et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">1974</a>)</cite>. Extreme weather events are expected to disrupt global food supply with increased frequency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ray et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Mehrabi and Ramankutty, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, and knowledge of the timing of crop growth stages in major growing regions is vital to accurately anticipate and quantify potential yield loss. Tracking crop growth stage progression, hereafter crop progress, is commonly done using ground surveyors. This task is laborious and requires widespread reporting infrastructure to produce the accurate and timely data. For example, in the US, the USDA coordinates weekly Crop Progress and Condition (CPR) reporting from over 5000 surveyors during the growing season <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(USDA National Agricultural Statistics
Service, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>)</cite>. However, many major exporting countries do not have publicly available crop progress data or surveys. Growers and grain market participants are then less informed about the present vulnerability of a region’s crop to adverse weather, which can lead to significant revisions to production estimates by government institutions when effects become apparent late in a growing season, (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Colussi and Schnitkey (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>). For many regions, their geographical size and lack of survey infrastructure prevent the collection of comprehensive crop progress data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In these unsurveyed regions, remote sensing (RS) observations may be used to estimate crop progress. The global coverage and frequent revisit times of modern earth-observing satellite platforms can provide cost-effective assessments of crop progress timing and may alleviate the need for ground survey infrastructure. Existing RS-based crop progress estimation (CPE) methods use observed crop canopy reflectances from a target growing region to derive relationships between vegetation indices (VI) such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and crop progress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gao and Zhang, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Many studies relate full-season VI curves to crop progress timing, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Diao (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Diao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Seo et al. (<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. These methods are useful for post-season analysis, but timely and frequent in-season estimates of crop progress are needed to quantify crop risk. This is because many critical growth stages in commodity crops, such as silking in corn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Claassen and Shaw, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">1970</a>)</cite>, last under two weeks. To meet these requirements, RS-based in-season studies have sought to produce actionable CPE through trend-based approaches, which use momentum indicators and thresholding to produce estimates for events such as emergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gao et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite> and cover crop termination <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gao et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>)</cite>. These approaches, however, utilize region-specific, user-defined parameters and do not target all growth stages. In addition, relationships between trend-based reference points such as ‘green-up’ and ‘maximum greenness’ and crop-specific growth stages is known to vary by method used <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Gao and Zhang, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) techniques, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shen et al., <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> and Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ghamghami et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, have been used to develop in-season CPE methods that can derive crop progress across all stages. These methods use historical crop progress as priors and estimate stage transition probabilities directly from RS and weather observations. However, both HMM and PEB rely on expectation maximization, which is sensitive to random weight initialization, and cannot derive higher order relationships between variables that are possible with contemporary ML techniques such as neural networks (NNs). Recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Worrall et al. (<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> found that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), an NN architecture widely used in time series analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zeyer et al., <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Cheng et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Song et al., <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, could be used to combine RS-based Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) data with soil and weather conditions for in-season CPE. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Worrall et al. (<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> found that LSTM-based in-season CPE produced 43% higher average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency across all stages than the HMM method from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Shen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>. NN-based in-season CPE has shown further improvement when guided by biophysical crop models. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Worrall et al. (<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> found that growth stage and water stress-related information from biophysical crop growth model simulations increased overall in-season CPE accuracy, particularly during seasons with abnormal temperatures and higher rainfall. Despite these recent advances in RS-based CPE, all existing methods still require ground truth crop progress data for calibration and/or training, limiting their application to regions where such data are available <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Seo et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Diao et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Worrall et al., <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In unsurveyed regions, studies have mapped RS-derived land surface phenology, such as ‘start-of-season’ and ‘end-of-season’ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vintrou et al., <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Duncan et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. However, crop progress in unsurveyed regions cannot be estimated from these points because ground survey data is required to derive crop-specific stage estimates from land surface phenology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Seo et al., <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Diao, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, which are known to change based on the target crop, method used, and region of application <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Gao and Zhang, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. To date, there are no RS-based methods that produce in-season CPE without ground survey data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">RS-based CPE in unsurveyed regions is difficult because there are no labeled data. In agricultural RS, crop mapping and yield estimation studies have addressed labeled data sparsity using transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nowakowski et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Luo et al., <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Khaki et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which involves pre-training an NN on a large, often unrelated dataset before fine-tuning it on limited available labeled data. Given the success of transfer learning in these studies, it may be possible to leverage information from labeled data in surveyed regions, such as the US, to train NN-based methods and apply them to unsurveyed regions for in-season CPE. However, without any fine-tuning examples of cropping practices, cultivar choices, and climate in unsurveyed regions, their transferability may be limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Another approach to mitigating data sparsity is to use generative methods to provide additional, synthetic training examples. Generation of synthetic examples is common in RS-based scene classification, where manual partitioning and labeling of scenes is labor intensive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cheng et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. A common generative method used in scene classification is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which produce additional, synthetic examples of class-specific patterns from a limited number of hand-labeled samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Qian et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Han et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. GANs are effective for image recognition tasks, but they require some labeled data to learn by example, which are not available for unsurveyed regions. Therefore, any generative method used to produce synthetic crop progress data must contain the underlying physical relationships among weather, crop growth and development, and observed reflectances that are present in real data without the need for labeled examples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Physically-based models for weather generation, crop growth, and canopy reflectances are widely used in agriculture and RS studies. Studies in agronomy often utilize stochastic weather generators to assess the impacts of different climate scenarios on crop production <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Semenov and Barrow, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>; Apipattanavis et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Supit et al., <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. Some studies calibrate biophysical crop models, driven by soil and weather data, to produce in-season yield estimates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Archontoulis et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Akhavizadegan et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In RS, optical radiative transfer models (RTMs), which simulate canopy reflectances at visible and infra-red wavelengths from plant structure and leaf pigment concentrations, are often inverted to retrieve estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and chlorophyll content <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Duan et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Jay et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. When these weather, crop, and RS models are linked, they can produce synthetic data that emulate real spatio-temporal patterns in agricultural production and their optical signatures, as observed from RS platforms. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lobell et al. (<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> used the APSIM crop model and LAI-VI relationships to calibrate an RS-based regression model for post-season yield estimation. There is precedent in the literature for using historical weather, mechanistic crop models, and RTMs to generate data for synthetic studies, such as soil moisture downscaling using microwaves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chakrabarti et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> and forest biomass estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fassnacht et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. However, to our knowledge, synthetic data generated from linked weather-crop-RTM models have not been leveraged to train NNs for application in areas without ground truth data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of this study is to explore how well synthetic data may mitigate the need for ground survey data to produce in-season crop progress estimates in unsurveyed regions. In this study, domain-specific models from meteorology, agronomy, and optical RS are linked to generate synthetic crop progress data. An NN-based RS CPE method is trained on both this synthetic data and observed data from surveyed regions in the US, then applied to CPE in unsurveyed regions. To assess the value of including synthetic crop progress data in unsurveyed region CPE, we investigated the performance of the NN-based method when it was trained solely on surveyed region data from the US. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to (1) implement a linked weather generator-crop model-RTM framework that can produce synthetic examples of crop progress data for an unsurveyed region, (2) investigate the impact of exposure to synthetic crop progress data during training on NN-based in-season CPE accuracy in unsurveyed regions, and (3) assess how NN-based CPE performance is affected by varied cropping practices in unsurveyed regions.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Argentina represented the ‘unsurveyed’ region in this study as it is one of the few countries, other than the US, with publicly available weekly crop progress data that could be used for evaluation of the NN-based method. The states of Iowa and Illinois in the US Midwest represented the ‘surveyed’ region. Both Argentina and the US are large exporters of staple crops such as corn and wheat. Corn, the second largest crop by global production, was used as the example crop <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(FAO, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.
In Argentina, the majority of corn is grown in a two-crop system, in which an early and late-season crop are planted September-November and December-January, respectively. The Argentine Bolsa de Cereales (BdC) defines 13 growing zones, of which 11 are surveyed for corn production (see Figure <a href="#S6.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 6 Figures ‣ In-Season Crop Progress in Unsurveyed Regions using Networks Trained on Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Nine out of these 11 zones grow both an early and a late corn crop (see Table <a href="#S7.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 7 Tables ‣ In-Season Crop Progress in Unsurveyed Regions using Networks Trained on Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 6 Figures ‣ In-Season Crop Progress in Unsurveyed Regions using Networks Trained on Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), which creates bimodal corn crop progress across a growing season. Additionally, temperate climates in the central zones allows for near-year round production, including winter-summer double cropping and post-season cover crops.
In contrast, in the US Midwest, corn is grown in a single crop system from April to November, with an April-May planting window in each of the eighteen USDA-defined districts in Iowa and Illinois (see Figure <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 6 Figures ‣ In-Season Crop Progress in Unsurveyed Regions using Networks Trained on Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). The differences in corn cultivation between Argentina and the US Midwest make Argentina an excellent disparate ‘unsurveyed’ test case for assessing the impacts of varied climate and cropping practices on the performance of the in-season CPE methods developed in this study.</p>

In this study, crop cover maps at 30 m of Argentina <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(de Abelleyra et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 seasons and of the US <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(USDA Ag Data Commons, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> for the 2003–2020 seasons were used to identify corn pixels. Crop maps were upscaled to 250 m using pixel averaging to match the resolution of the MODIS NDVI product. All pixels that contained &lt; 90% corn cover were masked and the NDVI values from MODIS observations for each corn pixel were linearly interpolated to produce daily time series values for the pixel. These time series were then collated into histograms of daily NDVI values across each district/zone, with 20 histogram bins in the range 0 to 1. Negative NDVI values were set to 0.</p>

This selection strategy was implemented as a trade-off between performance on surveyed and synthetic Argentina data. It was based upon the hypothesis that at some point during training (around batch 3500 in Figure <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 6 Figures ‣ In-Season Crop Progress in Unsurveyed Regions using Networks Trained on Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>), the NN will reach a performance plateau that is achievable from learning generalizable relationships between NDVI, GDD, and crop progress which are valid for both the surveyed and synthetic data. After this point, it will begin to abandon crop progress notions in favor of optimizing for the underlying logic within the crop model used to generate synthetic data, in order to continue to reduce the loss on the combined training set. As the network begins to overfit to IXIM, which is deterministic for set parameters, the surveyed data validation loss will start to increase.

Synthetic data generation for both of these stages relies on study-defined assumptions, which may explain why including only a single zone of synthetic data produced better results for these stages. For example, the assumptions for the Dough stage include its onset at 33% grain weight and near-linear grainfill rate in unstressed conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lizaso et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>, as shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 6 Figures ‣ In-Season Crop Progress in Unsurveyed Regions using Networks Trained on Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. For the Harvested stage, time between maturity and harvest is assumed to be normally distributed and independent of weather (see Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS2" title="3.2.2 CSM-IXIM ‣ 3.2 Synthetic Data Generation ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ In-Season Crop Progress in Unsurveyed Regions using Networks Trained on Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2.2</span></a>). It is possible that exposure to many examples of these assumptions negatively affected performance on these stages, but the limited examples in the A<sub id="S4.SS1.p1.10.7" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS1.p1.10.7.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">syn1</span></sub>U<sub id="S4.SS1.p1.10.8" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS1.p1.10.8.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sur</span></sub> set provided enough zone-specific crop progress information without overwhelming the weather-dependent relationships for these stages present in the surveyed region data. The additional synthetic data in the A<sub id="S4.SS1.p1.10.9" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS1.p1.10.9.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">syn</span></sub>U<sub id="S4.SS1.p1.10.10" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S4.SS1.p1.10.10.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sur</span></sub> set, which is weighted equally with surveyed region data during training, may encourage the network to adopt these synthetic data assumptions, thereby reducing performance.</p>

This is possibly because the GDD to maturity of the synthetic Argentina cultivar is closer to current <span id="S4.SS1.p2.8.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">in situ</span> Argentina cultivars than what is grown in the US Midwest. This result shows the limitations in transferability of a network to unsurveyed region CPE when trained only on data from a surveyed region with different crop growth dynamics.</p>

Additionally, simulations from another crop model, such as APSIM Maize <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Holzworth et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>, could provide more synthetic crop progress data using different crop modeling logic. This data could be combined during training, with validation losses monitored separately to ensure that a network learns crop progress notions which are applicable to both models and as well as surveyed region data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, the processing of RS data captured for real crop progress seasons in unsurveyed regions could be improved. The results from this study show that NDVI noise from pre- and post-season vegetation can affect network performance. This noise could be reduced by pixel-level masking of pre- and post-season NDVI signals. In this study, we used linearly interpolated pixel-level NDVI values, but higher complexity filters such as the Savitsky-Golay method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite> could be used to smooth NDVI pixel values before aggregation. Existing trend-based techniques such as those proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gao et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>)</cite> could then be used to estimate SOS and EOS dates on pixel-level NDVI curves. While these methods often have a delayed confirmatory signal, they may be sufficient to mask post-season pixel-level NDVI noise which affected network performance in this study, particularly in zones with a large separation between early and late planted crops, such as Zone V. Additionally, if early and late planting pixels can be differentiated in-season using crop mapping methods, it may also be possible to treat each planting window as a standalone season and remove the additional complexity required of a network to learn the dynamics of dual planting systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, RS-based in-season CPE could be further improved using complementary information from multiple remote sensing systems. For example, this study used optical data from MODIS, but observations at other wavelengths, such as microwaves from the Sentinel 1 and upcoming NISAR missions, could provide additional guidance for canopy properties such as soil and vegetation water content and biomass. This could improve differentiation between crop progress stages, and their synthetic equivalents could be modeled using radiative transfer models linked to the synthetic data generation process.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Existing crop progress estimation methods have been limited to surveyed regions due to the requirement of <span id="S5.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">in situ</span>, ground survey data for method training/calibration. In this study, we linked existing weather, crop, and optical RTM models to produce synthetic examples of crop progress for an unsurveyed region. Using Argentina as a test ‘unsurveyed’ region surrogate, we combined surveyed crop progress data from the US Midwest and synthetic data produced for zones in Argentina to train an LSTM-based NN for in-season CPE. Adapting F<sub id="S5.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sub">1</sub> score to measure CPE accuracy, results showed that introducing synthetic data into the training set improved network CPE performance, particularly in regions with two separate planting windows. Net F<sub id="S5.p1.2.3" class="ltx_sub">1</sub> scores across all six target stages of corn crop progress in Argentina increased by 8.7% when exposed to a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data during training, with performance most improved in dual planting zones. Results also showed that surveyed region data helps mitigate network sensitivity to NDVI noise. Overall, unsurveyed region performance was only 21% lower than the best case scenario, when the same network was trained and evaluated in surveyed US Midwest states. This result is significant given that the network had never seen real crop progress examples from Argentina during training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Building upon the results of this study, we outlined areas that could further improve the accuracy of CPE in unsurveyed regions, including seasonal masking of NDVI and increasing the quantity and variety of synthetic data. The aim of this study was in-season CPE in unsurveyed regions, but the method for generating synthetic data for network training presented here could also be applied to other areas of agricultural RS, such as crop mapping and yield estimation in both surveyed and unsurveyed regions.</p>
