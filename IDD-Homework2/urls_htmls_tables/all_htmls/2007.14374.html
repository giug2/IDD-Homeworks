<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which incorporates the Cloud, edge nodes and end devices, has shown great potential in bringing data processing closer to the data sources. Meanwhile, Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving approach to facilitating AI applications. However, it remains a big challenge to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of FL when it is integrated with the MEC architecture. Moreover, the unreliable nature (e.g., stragglers and intermittent drop-out) of end devices significantly slows down the FL process and affects the global model’s quality in such circumstances. In this paper, a multi-layer federated learning protocol called HybridFL is designed for the MEC architecture. HybridFL adopts two levels (the edge level and the cloud level) of model aggregation enacting different aggregation strategies. Moreover, in order to mitigate stragglers and end device drop-out, we introduce regional slack factors into the stage of client selection performed at the edge nodes using a probabilistic approach without identifying or probing the state of end devices (whose reliability is agnostic). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in modulating the proportion of clients selected and present the convergence analysis for our protocol. We have conducted extensive experiments with machine learning tasks in different scales of MEC system. The results show that HybridFL improves the FL training process significantly in terms of shortening the federated round length, speeding up the global model’s convergence (by up to 12<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><times id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math>) and reducing end device energy consumption (by up to 58%).</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid advance and remarkable achievements made in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have drawn an unprecedented level of attention and revealed the potential of machine learning techniques. Meanwhile, the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Intelligence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> stimulates the efforts of pushing the computation to the edge of the network (closer to where the source of data resides) for faster response and better service quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. With these two streams of research endeavour, it has been a major trend to empower the end devices in IoT with AI applications – Gartner has predicted that over 80% of enterprise IoT projects will incorporate AI components by 2022 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which consists of Cloud, edge nodes and end devices, is an emerging technology that can serve as the fundamental architecture of IoT, and provides a promising architecture for sinking AI to the edge nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, there are still many obstacles when it comes to the practical AI scenarios where the participants of the model training process are end devices such as cell phones, smart sensors and wearable electronics. First, although much work has shown good performance when training AI models in a cloud-centric manner using high-spec servers that hold the entire data set, it may not be feasible in many application scenarios (e.g., clinical diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>) nowadays due to the data privacy concerns or the administration policies that forbid moving data out of local devices. Besides, though traditional distributed machine learning techniques (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>) can deal with decentralized data, they require very frequent exchange of gradients and model parameters, which results in heavy network traffic and prohibitive cost of communication in the cases where the devices are connected to the cloud via wireless channels.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, originally proposed by Google, is a distributed machine learning protocol designed for addressing the above-mentioned problems of data privacy and communication efficiency when training from decentralized data. A typical FL process consists of multiple rounds of training, in each of which clients (i.e., end devices) perform model training on local data and the cloud aggregates local models to produce a global model using a weight-averaging algorithm called <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>. As stated by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the key properties of FL are: i) <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">unbalanced data distribution</span>: end devices may possess variable amounts of Non-IID (Non Independent and Identically Distributed) data; ii) <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">massively distributed devices</span>: the participants can be a huge fleet of heterogeneous end devices; iii) <span id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">limited access and communication</span>: data access is limited to local devices while the communication between the cloud and end devices can be slow and expensive.</p>

The two levels of model aggregation are controlled by the ”aggregation signal” sent from the cloud based on the information of local models collected by the edge nodes. In the system, clients are connected to the edge nodes via relatively low-speed (compared with high-speed network), shared (therefore noisy) wireless channels, whilst the edge-cloud connection is more stable (typically through Ethernet) and the bandwidth is typically sufficient.</figcaption>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the privacy-preserving and communication-efficient nature of federated learning, it is now regarded as a promising approach to realizing intelligence on local devices and is a natural fit for the classic two-layer architectures such as cloud computing. However, with the emergence of MEC, there is still much room to explore in adapting the original FL protocol to the three-layer hierarchy of MEC, where abundant resources (in terms of computation, storage and network) are available in the edge layer. The necessity of such adaptation is two-fold. First, the network connection between the central server (i.e., the cloud) and the geographically distributed devices can be fairly slow and unreliable. Second, the central server may get overwhelmed by the workload or the network traffic due to excessive model updates from a vast number of clients. Introducing the edge layer, comprised of edge nodes such as base stations and servers in micro data centers, to the FL process can address these issues effectively. Edge nodes are proximate to the end devices and able to provide more stable connections and sufficient resources in computation. Existing work on edge-based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> has made use of edge resources or realized multi-step aggregation. However, the following issues have not been resolved yet: i) the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">unreliability</span> of end devices (and their connections) is not considered; ii) the inefficiency of FL caused by the <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">heterogeneity</span> in end devices (and their bandwidth) is not addressed; iii) the <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">capability of edge nodes</span> (especially in terms of network) is not fully exploited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The situation becomes even more challenging when combined with the strong privacy-preserving scenario, in which the servers are restricted from probing the information of clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. For example, in the keyboard input prediction task, the device-server communication is stateless – end devices can be invited to participate, but cannot be tracked, and their reliability (i.e., the chance that they drop/opt out during the training) is agnostic.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel protocol (HybridFL) to enable privacy-preserving, efficient federated learning under the MEC architecture. Fig. 1 shows an overview of our protocol. We leverage the capability of edge nodes to boost the efficiency of communication and adapt FL to the three-layer hierarchy of MEC by making the FL process a hybrid of client-edge and edge-cloud collaborations. We also take into account both the unreliability and heterogeneity of end devices under strong privacy conditions and adopt a pace steering mechanism which is a hybrid of synchronous (edge-cloud) and asynchronous (client-edge) communication..

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and its variations have been the de facto standards for training most of the modern machine learning models. The fundamentals of previous distributed learning methods were built on the exchange of gradients, no matter in a centralized or decentralized manner. Extensive studies have shown the effectiveness of distributed SGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> for complex models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, most of these traditional methods are designed for or tested in the data-center type of environments, where the data can be accessed globally by all workers and the financial cost of the communications is hardly considered as an issue. However, the real-life scenarios of MEC are usually comprised of low-spec, unreliable end devices, geographically distributed edge nodes with moderate performance, and relatively low-speed, noisy communication between edge nodes and end devices via wireless channels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL), in a large part, addresses the problems of data privacy and prohibitive communication cost in training a global model from decentralized data. FL was originally designed as a synchronous training protocol called FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which is a weight-averaging algorithm and aggregates the local models from end devices to produce a new global model each round. Model exchange, which is much less frequent (and thereby more communication-efficient) than the gradient exchange in traditional distributed SGD methods, is the outstanding feature of FL. Many Studies show that there is still potential in further reducing the communication cost of FL via model compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, setting adaptive aggregation intervals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and using multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In addition, many variants of the FL protocol have also been proposed. For example, Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and Sprague et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> adopted asynchronous federated optimization schemes with non-blocking global model update and allowing devices to join halfway during training. SAFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is semi-asynchronous FL protocol that retains the synchronized pace steering while introducing the strategies such as post-training client selection and model caching to speed up the training process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is natural to adapt FL to the emerging Mobile Edge Computing. A number of studies have provided their solutions to such adaptation. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> took into account the resource budgets for edge nodes and proposed a pace control algorithm that adaptively adjusts the aggregation interval of FL. They adopted a system architecture in which the data reside on edge nodes, which essentially makes the system still a two-layer FL protocol. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> implemented a hierarchical FL protocol that utilizes the cloud server and the edge nodes to perform two levels of model aggregation. The protocol is a straightforward extension of FedAvg, allowing multiple rounds in the edge layer before a global aggregation by the cloud. A main problem of the work is that each pair of interactions (i.e., client-edge and edge-cloud) is tightly coupled. As a result, device/network failures will cause both the edge nodes and the cloud to wait for a long time. In addition, in HierFAVG, edge nodes have to perform multiple rounds of edge-level aggregation before sending models to the cloud. This significantly postpones the global exchange of model information and consequently slows down the convergence. Considering the drawbacks of the existing solutions in driving FL in the MEC systems, in this work we aim to develop a more efficient FL protocol that enables fast, robust machine learning by virtue of the resources in the edge layer.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are eight steps in each round of training using the HybridFL protocol to drive FL in the MEC architecture (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Accelerating Federated Learning over Reliability-Agnostic Clients in Mobile Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).

The second stage, local training, is performed on the clients (end devices) and also includes the steps of model downloading and uploading via the client-edge connections. Aggregation is the final stage of a round where the local models (selected and uploaded) are merged into a global model.

Introduction ‣ Accelerating Federated Learning over Reliability-Agnostic Clients in Mobile Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). The edge nodes will then stop waiting for more local models. This quota-triggered regional aggregation effectively mitigates the impact of the clients which have dropped out or are straggling.

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We adopt an <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">immediate cloud aggregation</span> strategy, which allows the cloud-level model aggregation to be conducted right after the edge-level aggregation is completed. The rationale behind this strategy is that the cloud-edge network connection is typically reliable and of low latency. Therefore, it facilitates the global information exchange and the convergence of the global model by aggregating the regional models at the cloud level as early as possible after the regional aggregations are completed at the edge nodes.

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The heterogeneity of end devices is a common property of practical MEC systems. FL in such systems can involve a vast number of heterogeneous end devices, whose discrepancy in capability (e.g., CPU performance, bandwidth) and reliability has the major impact on the overall efficiency of FL. In this paper, we characterize the heterogeneity of clients by mainly considering their compute performance, bandwidth and reliability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The compute performance of a client determines how efficiently it conducts local training and can be measured by the CPU frequency (in GHz). Given the same training task and the same size of data partition, clients with lower performance require more time for local training. A certain space of memory is required for any on-device training process. For simplicity we assume that clients only participate when they have sufficient memory, and that memory does not impact clients’ performance. After on-device training is completed, local models need to be transmitted to the edge nodes. In this step, device bandwidth is the main factor that determines the communication time between the edge and end devices. Due to the heterogeneity of clients, the time needed for model download/upload and local training differs from client to client. The heterogeneity of clients also differentiates them in energy consumption, which is determined jointly by their power consumption in computation and communication and the time needed for local training (computation) and model transmission (communication). The formulation of device performance and energy consumption is detailed in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Experimental Evaluation ‣ Accelerating Federated Learning over Reliability-Agnostic Clients in Mobile Edge Computing Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We also assume that clients are discrepant in reliability because they may drop/opt out by a different probability. Practically, the causes of client drop-out can involve many factors including any subjective/objective reasons, and they all vary from situation to situation. The correlation between these factors and how likely a client drops out is very complicated and beyond the scope of this work. In this paper, we consider client drop-out as an independent event. Our protocol is designed to be completely independent on the distribution of clients’ drop-out probability (i.e., designed for reliability-agnostic scenarios).</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The design of HybridFL mitigates the negative impact of end devices’ heterogeneity and unreliability on the efficiency and effectiveness of FL. The introduction of regional slack factors enables our protocol to modulate the number of model submissions for each region based on the desired proportion controlled by the cloud. The slack factors are determined without any a priori knowledge on any client’s drop-out probability. Besides, the quota-triggered aggregation mechanism in HybridFL allows the cloud to end a round once the quota is met, rather than passively awaiting response from every selected client. This effectively accelerates an FL round and makes the protocol less susceptible to device failure.</p>

The MEC system was established with simulated parties (i.e., the cloud, edge nodes and end devices) that comprise the three-layer architecture. On-device training in the FL process was implemented using the PyTorch framework. Each group of end devices (clients) are managed by and connected to an edge node via wireless channels, which forms a region, whilst the edge nodes and the cloud are connected through high-speed Ethernet. All the clients and their local network are implemented as being unreliable in the simulated MEC system.

FedAvg is the primitive FL protocol proposed by Google for the two-layer client/server architecture. HierFAVG is a three-layer FL protocol for Edge Computing systems and adopts a similar training architecture as our protocol by introducing the edge layer that performs the edge-level model aggregation before the global aggregation conducted by the cloud. HierFAVG has no adaptive control over the flow of models. Both the edge and the cloud have to await the responses from all the selected clients. We compare the FL training process driven by these protocols and our HybridFL under the same settings.

In this task we aim to simulate a scenario in which the image samples are distributed over a relatively large fleet of end devices and they are not shared among the devices or allowed to be uploaded to the servers. This is a realistic scenario for mobile applications that are restricted by the privacy terms. In this experiment, 500 clients and 10 edge nodes are set up for running this task. Besides, to emulate the discrepancy in device users’ behaviour (which leads to the biases in the data distribution over devices), we assigned the samples to clients by matching data labels with clients’ indices – sample <math id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(x_{i},y_{i})" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">(</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">x</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.4" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml">y</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.5" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2b"><interval closure="open" id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2"><apply id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑥</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p5.1.m1.2c">(x_{i},y_{i})</annotation></semantics></math> has a 75% chance to reside on (one of) the clients whose IDs are congruent to <math id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="y_{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">y</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p5.2.m2.1c">y_{i}</annotation></semantics></math> modulo 10 (the MNIST data set has 10 classes).

We find that the advantage of HybridFL in energy saving in Task 2 is not as prominent as in Task 1. Yet our protocol still managed to retain the on-device energy usage at the lowest level. This is because it enables much faster convergence (therefore less total training time for devices) than the baseline protocols. In practice, the energy-saving feature of HybridFL can help attract more end devices in each round.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p10.1" class="ltx_p">The evaluation of the proposed protocol (HybridFL) with the two machine learning tasks under different environment settings demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of boosting the efficiency of FL, improving the global model’s quality and saving on-device energy consumption in a three-layer MEC system. The reasons behind these improvements are three-fold. First, the quota-triggered regional aggregation in HybridFL effectively prevents the situation where some regions with extremely unreliable clients slow down the entire FL process. Second, we enable each edge node to modulate its regional quota based on its slack factor to improve the robustness of FL against client drop-out. Third, the cloud (i.e., global) aggregation is designed to be performed immediately after regional aggregation so that the global exchange of the model is made as early as possible.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Thanks to the ever-increasing capacity of compute, storage and bandwidth at the edge of network, it has been a prominent trend that more and more end devices are infiltrated by the power of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, the rising concerns about data privacy are changing the way we develop machine learning techniques and also reveal the great potential of using Federated Learning as a promising privacy-preserving solution. In this paper, we adapt FL to the mobile edge computing systems, aiming to improve both effectiveness and efficiency. We design a three-layer FL protocol called HybridFL to enable two levels of model aggregation to boost efficiency and mitigate the impact by the unreliable nature of end devices through modulating client selection in a region-wise manner, which results in a reasonable number of local updates as desired by the cloud. We conducted extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that HybridFL significantly improves FL in the MEC system by shortening the average length of a round, speeding up the convergence of the global model, promoting the model accuracy, and reducing device-side energy consumption.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, we plan to extend our work to more complex system architectures which have different hierarchies and to diverse FL participants which have different roles. As another part of our future work, we plan to investigate how to improve the effectiveness of local training on each device without breaching the privacy constraints.</p>
