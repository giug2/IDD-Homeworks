<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Data drift is a thorny challenge when deploying person re-identification (ReID) models into real-world devices, where the data distribution is significantly different from that of the training environment and keeps changing.
To tackle this issue, we propose a federated spatial-temporal incremental learning approach, named FedSTIL, which leverages both lifelong learning and federated learning to continuously optimize models deployed on many distributed edge clients.
Unlike previous efforts, FedSTIL aims to mine spatial-temporal correlations among the knowledge learnt from different edge clients.
Specifically, the edge clients first periodically extract general representations of drifted data to optimize their local models.
Then, the learnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter server, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from spatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms.
Finally, the distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to correlated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each edge client with a lifelong learning method.
Extensive experiments on a mixture of five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms others by nearly 4% in Rank-1 accuracy, while reducing communication cost by 62%.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve people appearing at different locations and moments from the over-lapped cameras.
The deep learning-based approaches for person ReID can achieve promising performance on popular benchmarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which enables the applications of person ReID in many computer vision-based applications, such as city surveillance, suspect tracking, and urban analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The deployment of person ReID in real-life still suffers from many great challenges.
One prevalent challenge is that the recognition accuracy of the person ReID models will decrease, with the changing of camera environments.
This is mainly because of the domain mismatch between the training and deployment environments.
Specifically, the person ReID models are usually pre-trained on given datasets which consist of images of a fixed set of person identities captured in specific camera environments.
However, in the real-life person ReID deployment, thousands of newly images that are captured every moment often involve many new person identities, which are unavailable at the model training stage.
Meanwhile, the camera environments are dynamic and ever-changing due to influences brought by many reasons, such as illumination changing and varying camera views.
The domain gap between the training and inference environment limits the performance of person ReID in real-world deployment.

</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another challenge for person ReID is to preserve the privacy of the person images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
The person images contain sensitive private information, such as individuals’ identities, locations, genders, ethnicity, and even facial features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Sharing these sensitive person images for model training and data analytics is infeasible due to the potential risk of privacy leakage and the expensive communication costs for data transmission.
Besides, many EU/UK countries have issued privacy protection regulations (e.g., GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>) to prohibit the centralization of sensitive data from in-situ devices.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the domain shift problem for person ReID, some recent works (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>) adopted lifelong learning.
These works enable person ReID models to continuously learn knowledge from new scenarios without forgetting previously learnt knowledge.
HVIL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> presents a human-in-the-loop paradigm for lifelong person ReID under interactive manual feedback.
CRL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and AKA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> generalise the representation of lifelong person ReID for intra- and inter- domains respectively.
GwFReID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> alleviates forgetting under a class-imbalance lifelong condition for person ReID.
However, these works require centralized training with the drifted data from deployed devices to learn new knowledge, which also bring data privacy concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To alleviate privacy concerns, some recent works (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>) adopted federated learning to jointly train models on the edge clients without centralizing data.
The federated learning-based approaches enable the sensitive data to be utilized in situ (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>),
while different edge clients can collaboratively update models by aggregating the gradients or parameters (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>) without sharing private data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Prior works, however, considered the problems of continuously updating models and decentralized training models separately.
They are still unable to support distributed edge clients to continuously learn new knowledge while collaboratively sharing their knowledge under privacy-preserving.
Hence, we first propose to judiciously combine both federated learning and lifelong learning for person ReID.
Moreover, we observe that knowledge learnt from different locations and moments has implicit spatial and temporal correlations.
As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, pedestrians that appeared in the past often reappear on other streets in the near future.
We suppose the knowledge learnt from one edge client may also be informative to other neighbor clients shortly.
However, previous works neglected the spatial-temporal correlations for recognition knowledge at different locations and moments.
Therefore, they failed to adaptively utilize the knowledge across spatial and temporal spaces, and thus limit performance improvement.</p>

The edge clients utilize their arriving drift data to optimize the local model for incremental domain knowledge.
Meanwhile, some general representations of the drift data are periodically stored in local memory for future rehearsal to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting.
Next, the parameter server integrates the incremental knowledge from different edge clients based on the spatial-temporal correlation.
Then, the parameter server delivers these informative knowledge to the edge clients.
Finally, the edge clients will utilize both the integrated knowledge and previous learnt knowledge to further improve the model with lifelong learning.
The framework enables the distributed edge clients to continuously and collaboratively learn from every new scenario without sharing private data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Person ReID aims at retrieving a person from non-overlapped camera views.
The developments of deep neural network and the large-scale person ReID datasets have significantly improved the performances of person ReID in many vision-based applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
The flows of person ReID mainly includes two stages: training and deployment.
The training stage enable person ReID models to learn how to extract the representations from a person’s images or videos captured by different non-overlapped cameras.
Recent works for training person ReID models have achieved great progress over data processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
The goal of the deployment stage is to maintain robust performances for retrieval over the real-life domains.
Many recent works for deployment focus on domain adaption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and lifelong learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to narrow the mismatches between different domains.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In real-world person ReID deployments, camera environments and person characteristics are always different from that of training data.
To narrow the domain shifts for the training and deployment stages, some recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> adopted the lifelong learning strategies for person ReID.
Lifelong learning enables the models to continuously learn from every new domain or scenario, which has been widely adopted in many DNN-based serving systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to deal with the domain drift.
The greatest challenge for lifelong person ReID is catastrophic forgetting, which requires ReID models to retain previous knowledge while continually training on new task streams.
Recently, HVIL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> introduced a human-in-the-loop incremental learning method, which enforces models to adaptively refresh and optimize parameters under the supervision of human feedbacks on mismatched person images.
AKA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposed a learnable knowledge graph for lifelong person ReID, which can preserve the knowledge from previous domains while propagating learnt knowledge on future unseen domains.
GwFReID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a class-imbalance lifelong learning for person ReID to generalise the representations for unseen domains without forgetting.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the growing data privacy concern, many person ReID systems are changing to the decentralized or federated training paradigm, where the parameters for edge models can be jointly updated among different source domains instead of centralising private data for training.
One challenge for federated person ReID is knowledge interference due to the data heterogeneity across different source
domains.
To address this problem, FedReID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and some other works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> adopted model aggregation and knowledge distillation to optimize the performances for the federated person ReID.
SKA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a selective knowledge aggregation method to transfer personalized knowledge among different edge clients.
However, most of the existing works for federated person ReID ignored the spatial-temporal correlation for domain knowledge from different edge locations and moments, which limits the efficiency of knowledge sharing.
Our method can capture task-specific knowledge by integrating spatial-temporal knowledge from the edge clients to improve performances.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the rapid progresses of lifelong person ReID and federated person ReID, few works studied lifelong person ReID under the federated learning paradigm, which we term as federated lifelong person ReID.
Some works (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>) that studied federated lifelong learning are not specific for person ReID, and there are some limitations when applying these methods to person ReID.
For instance, FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> extended the regularization-based lifelong learning method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> to the federated learning scenario,
and it adopts model aggregation to share knowledge among edge clients.
To alleviate catastrophic forgetting during continuously training, it introduces some extra information matrices to prevent the updating of the parameters that are important for previous tasks.
However, the high communication cost for transferring the extra information is an obstacle to apply FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> in the federated lifelong person ReID scenario.
FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> utilized decomposed network layers with local adaptive knowledge and global transferred knowledge.
It prevents catastrophic forgetting by replaying the task-specific parameters on inference stages.
FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> can be adopted for the incremental task learning where task IDs are provided.
However, it is not applicable in the problem scenarios where task IDs are unknown, such as the federated lifelong person ReID scenario.
To the best of our knowledge, we are one of the first works which studied federated lifelong learning for person ReID.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A Problem Definition ‣ III System Design ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, our federated lifelong framework, FedSTIL, consists of one central parameter server and several distributed edge clients.
The edge clients continuously retrain local models with newly obtained drift data,
and the parameter server aggregates spatial-temporal knowledge from the edge clients’ local models for knowledge sharing.
The network backbones are alternative, such as MobileNet, ResNet, and ViT.
We divide the backbone of each edge model into two parts: 1) the extraction layers initialized with global pre-trained weights to extract task prototypes, and 2) the adaptive layers for personalized lifelong learning.
Considering the limited computing capacity of the edge clients, our framework adopts the last several layers of the backbone as adaptive layers for training, and the rest layers are extraction layers.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The learning procedures of FedSTIL are as follows.
The edge clients collect the new drifted data as incremental tasks and extract the general representation from the drifted data as prototypes of raw data.
The edge clients learn incremental knowledge from these prototypes of drift data, and then upload learnt knowledge to the parameter server.
The parameter server aggregates these incremental knowledge based on the spatial-temporal correlation of neighbors’ task characteristics, and delivers the task-relevant knowledge to the edge clients.
The edge clients adaptively utilize dispatched knowledge and previously learnt knowledge to optimize models for new scenarios continuously.
Meanwhile, some general prototypes of raw data will be stored in each edge client for future rehearsal to alleviate the forgetting of previously learnt knowledge.

Specifically, when a training task arrives, we first input the prototypes of the task into the adaptive layers.
Then, we calculate the mean center of the outputs of the adaptive layers for each person identity.
We will store some prototypes whose outputs are closest to the mean centers of different person identities.
Those prototypes are informative to maintain the representation of previously learnt knowledge.
During the training phases for new tasks, we periodically sample some stored prototypes for training to mitigate the forgetting of the previously learnt knowledge.</p>

That is because prototypes are smaller than raw images for storage.

In this work, we adopt Kullback-Leibler Divergence as the similarity function because it can effectively measure the information difference between different distributions.

However, the tasks which arrive recently have a more significant impact on the model knowledge,

The edge clients collect new drifted data as new tasks, and input these tasks into their extraction layers to generate feature vectors as the prototypes.
Then, the edge clients upload the task features, which are the average of the prototypes, to the parameter server.
The parameter server calculates the similarities with the task features of the historical tasks from different edge clients.
Based on these similarities, the parameter server will integrate the task-relevant knowledge as the base parameters for each edge client, and the edge clients can continuously learn from the new tasks based on the integrated knowledge from other edge clients.
Finally, when the training of the edge clients’ models converges, the parameters of the adaptive layers of the edge models will be uploaded to the parameter server to further improve other spatial-temporal correlated edge clients.</p>

We shuffle the images of these datasets into 5 distributed edge clients with non-overlapped camera-IDs.
Then, the images for each edge client are grouped into 6 sequential tasks.
For each task, we randomly sample 60% of the images as training data and 40% of the images as query data. In addition, the gallery images are collected from different edge clients which have different camera views for query images.</p>

The edge models are trained for 5 epochs at each communication round between parameter server and edge clients.
To avoid the overfitting issue, the training phases will stop if the loss stops decreasing for 3 epochs.
We only use random erasing for the image augmentation.
Considering the limited computing capacity of the edge devices, only the last residual block and the classifier will be updated during training, and the other layers are fixed with pre-trained weights.</p>

Our FedSTIL can outperform other baseline methods in accuracy and communication cost.
The most competitive baseline method, FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, is about 4% lower than our method on mAP, and the S2C communication cost is 2.89 times higher compared with our method.
The higher accuracy and lower communication cost make our method more applicable in real-world person ReID scenarios.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the average accuracy of different edge clients under different federated lifelong learning methods (i.e., FedSTIL, FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>) in Fig <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-C Training Methodology ‣ IV Learning Methodology ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
Compared with the baseline methods, our method can achieve higher accuracy over 60 rounds of training.
Besides, with continuous training on the new tasks, the accuracy can increase stablely with less fluctuation, which also indicates the robustness of our methods.
This improvement is largely owing to the effective knowledge sharing and the alleviation of the forgetting of the learnt knowledge during federated lifelong learning.
We then analyze the impact of knowledge sharing and forgetting on federated lifelong person ReID.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Knowledge Sharing.</span>
Our FedSTIL can achieve higher accuracy because it can effectively exchange knowledge among edge clients.
In general, all federated learning-based methods (i.e., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and our FedSTIL) can achieve higher accuracy than other local-based training methods (i.e., STL, EWC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, MAS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, and iCaRL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>).
These results indicate that exchanging on-edge knowledge can significantly improve the overall accuracy,
because the local data of an edge client is limited for learning, such as insufficient data or limited camera views.
Thus, sharing the knowledge across edge clients can make up for the limitations of local data.
Moreover, we can observe that our FedSTIL achieves the highest accuracy compared with other federated learning-based methods (i.e., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, and FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>).
The improvement mainly owes to the task-relevant knowledge sharing among edge clients, which alleviates the interference incurred by the irrelevant knowledge transferring among the edge clients’ models.</p>

Our FedSTIL can maintain the accuracy with less forgetting of the previous knowledge during the continuous training on the subsequent tasks.
We can observe in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-C Training Methodology ‣ IV Learning Methodology ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> that both the Rank-1 and mAP accuracy of federated learning methods (i.e., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>) will not increase after the <math id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="40" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">40</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">40</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p3.1.m1.1c">40</annotation></semantics></math>-th round.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B1 Comparison of Accuracy ‣ V-B Performance Comparison ‣ V Experiment ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, this is because the knowledge learnt from the past tasks is gradually forgotten during the learning of the new tasks.
In contrast, federated lifelong methods (i.e., FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and FedSTIL) can alleviate forgetting on the past tasks, which help to achieve higher accuracy.</p>

FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> has lower accuracy with higher communication cost.
That is because FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> needs to transfer excessive additional information to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Our FedSTIL is more communication-efficient because it does not need to exchange additional parameters among edge clients except model weights.
This improvement is largely because FedSTIL only requests task-specific parameters, which have been aggregated by the parameter server based on the relevant spatial-temporal knowledge.
Moreover, our FedSTIL can achieve higher accuracy compared with the other baseline methods by using the cheaper model ResNet18, which has lower computation cost and storage consumption.
Therefore, FedSTIL is more applicable for deployment in real-life person ReID scenarios by reducing communication and computational costs.</p>

We analyze the catastrophic forgetting of our method as Eq.

As shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-C Ablation Study ‣ V Experiment ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, the Rank-1 Forgetting (R1-F), Rank-5 Forgetting (R5-F), and mAP Forgetting (mAP-F) keep decreasing as the memory size increases.
With a larger memory size for storing prototypes, the knowledge from more historical tasks can be saved for future rehearsal.
Therefore, the rehearsal with more historical prototypes can effectively alleviate the forgetting of the previous knowledge.
In addition, the Rank-1 Forgetting with the memory size 20,000 (20K) is nearly <math id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">2</mn><mo id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">2\%</annotation></semantics></math> lower than without prototype rehearsal, which is within the acceptable range in the real-life person ReID scenario.

We analyze the influences of choosing different network backbones on the accuracy, storage cost, and communication cost.
Specifically, we utilize ResNet18, ResNet50, and Swin-Transformer (Swin-T) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> as backbones for training.
Considering the limited computing capacity of edge devices, only the last block of these backbones are trainable during learning, and the rest blocks are fixed with the pre-trained weights.
As shown in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ V-C Ablation Study ‣ V Experiment ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, our FedSTIL can outperform the other baselines on accuracy (i.e., mAP, Rank-1, Rank-5), storage, and total communication cost (TC) with different backbones.
The storage size of FedSTIL is comparable with FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and larger than FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
The communication cost of FedSTIL is lower compared with FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and FedWeIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, while the accuracy of FedSTIL is the highest with different backbones.
These results verify the compatibility of our method with different backbones.
Therefore, one can choose suitable backbones based on the computing capacity of the edge client.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Error Loss without Parameter Tying.</span>
To further investigate the effectiveness of parameter tying, we then analyze the error loss of different tasks during training.
As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-B1 Comparison of Accuracy ‣ V-B Performance Comparison ‣ V Experiment ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, we compare the error loss by eliminating the parameter tying from Task-1 to Task-5 during different training epochs.
Our FedSTIL with the parameter tying can achieve lower loss and converge much faster than eliminating the parameter tying.
The improvement is mainly because parameter tying enables on-edge models to continuously fit new tasks with minimal parameter changes and forgetting of previous knowledge learnt in the past.
Thus, the design of tying the spatial-temporal correlated edge models for jointly optimizing can achieve better convergence and generalization.</p>

Considering the characteristics of the task features, we adopt Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence to compute the spatial-temporal correlation ratio when aggregating the personalized sharing knowledge.
We also evaluate the retrieval accuracy of our method under some other distance metrics, namely, Cosine Distance and Euclidean Distance.
As shown in Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ V-C Ablation Study ‣ V Experiment ‣ Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>, KL can achieve higher accuracy than other metrics.
Different from Cosine and Euclidean, KL can effectively measure the information difference among the different distributions of task features.
Hence, KL can help the parameter server precisely measure the edge similarities to aggregate the spatial-temporal knowledge with low noise and less interference.</p>

On the contrary, the attention regions of our oracle method FedSTIL are mainly on the overall person’s body and have more generalized representations.
This improvement is largely due to the effectiveness of knowledge sharing to improve the generalizing capacities for edge clients.
Moreover, we can also observe that the model without prototype rehearsal may deviate from the regions of a person, and may even focus on the surrounding or background regions.
This is probably because the learnt knowledge from the prior tasks will be gradually forgotten during the continuous learning of new scenarios.
However, our FedSTIL with the prototype rehearsal will mitigate the forgetting of the former knowledge and maintain the focus on person regions during continuously learning.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed a federated lifelong learning framework, FedSTIL, which enables the distributed edge clients to learn collaboratively and continuously in real-life for person ReID in new scenarios.
Our proposed method can utilize the spatial-temporal correlated knowledge among the edge clients to improve the data representation for person ReID and achieve better performance.
Meanwhile, the learnt knowledge from the historical tasks can remain long-term effective with only slight forgetting during continuously learning for new scenarios.
Experimental results verified that FedSTIL improves the accuracy of person ReID while reducing the communication cost for distributed learning.</p>
