<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a decentralised learning technique that enables participating devices to collaboratively build a shared Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) model without revealing their raw data to a third party. Due to its privacy-preserving nature, FL has sparked widespread attention for building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) within the realm of cybersecurity. However, the data heterogeneity across participating domains and entities presents significant challenges for the reliable implementation of an FL-based IDS. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Statistical Averaging (StatAvg) to alleviate non-independently and identically (non-iid) distributed features across local clients’ data in FL. In particular, StatAvg allows the FL clients to share their individual data statistics with the server, which then aggregates this information to produce global statistics. The latter are shared with the clients and used for universal data normalisation. It is worth mentioning that StatAvg can seamlessly integrate with any FL aggregation strategy, as it occurs before the actual FL training process. The proposed method is evaluated against baseline approaches using datasets for network and host Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered IDS. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of StatAvg in mitigating non-iid feature distributions across the FL clients compared to the baseline methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the dynamic era of smart technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, Artificial Intelligence (AI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and 6G ultra-dense wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, the attack surface increases significantly. In particular, from single-step attacks, the attackers now have the ability to design and execute multi-step attack scenarios, targeting multiple systems and domains in a coordinated and synchronised manner. Some characteristic attack campaigns, according to MITRE ATT&amp;CK, are (a) C0034 - 2022 Ukraine Electric Power Attack and (b) C0022 - Operation Dream Job. Moreover, the rapid evolution of AI allows cyberattackers to create sophisticated cyberattacks that can adjust to mitigation activities and relevant countermeasures. Generative AI agents are able to automatically exploit one-day vulnerabilities. Finally, despite the fact that AI can play a significant role in defensive mechanisms, adversarial attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> can mislead AI-enabled decision-making processes. Therefore, it is evident that the presence of reliable and efficient intrusion detection mechanisms is more necessary than ever.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) rely on signature-based methods, where predefined attack rules or patterns, referred to as signatures, are identified and compared with the monitoring data, thus alerting a potential threat if a match is found. For instance, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Snort</span> and <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Suricata</span> are popular IDS in this category. On the other hand, in recent years, both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have already demonstrated significant promise as a means to detect cyberattacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, it is worth mentioning that these models need the presence of appropriate security datasets that are often not publicly available, especially for critical domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In addition, appropriate adjustments are required to re-train and integrate these models. Finally, conventional ML/DL methods are conducted in a centralised fashion, where a central entity collects all the necessary data from endpoints to construct training datasets and afterwards generates the ML/DL models. Although this approach successfully enables the detection of intrusions, it raises privacy concerns since endpoints’ private data are shared with third parties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To alleviate privacy issues and mitigate communication overhead, Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as an inherently privacy-preserving decentralised learning solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. According to the FL principles, the participating clients are building an ML/DL model collaboratively with the aid of a central entity (e.g., a central server). The salient feature of FL is that clients transmit locally trained models to the server rather than raw data. Afterwards, the server aggregates the received parameters, updates the global model, and subsequently broadcasts it to the clients. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ StatAvg: Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, this workflow is repeated until convergence is achieved. Consequently, the server has no access to clients’ raw datasets. However, despite the benefits of FL, a notable challenge in the design of an FL-based IDS is the existence of non-independently and identically distributed (iid) data among clients, commonly referred to as data heterogeneity. In particular, if the data (including both benign and attack patterns) is not representative across the clients, the global model may become biased, thus working efficiently on some cases but inaccurately on others. Next, the presence of non-iid data can affect the federated training procedure in terms of delaying convergence. Finally, communication issues may also arise, given that more communication rounds might be required to ensure adequate model updates across the FL clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the aforementioned remarks, in this paper, we introduce the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Statistical Averaging (StatAvg)</span> method to circumvent the challenges of non-iid features of clients in FL. Due to different feature distributions across clients, the local data normalisation process may differ from client to client. This inconsistency may slow down or even prevent the convergence of the federated global model since each local model is trained on a different input distribution. To this end, <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> aims at producing global data statistics that can serve as a universal normalisation for the local data of each client. To achieve this, the server is responsible for collecting the local statistics of the clients and afterwards aggregating them properly to produce global data statistics. In this manner, clients normalise their local data by sharing a common normalisation scaling, reflected by the global statistics, aimed at mitigating the effects of non-iid features present in their local datasets.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several works investigate the role and impact of FL in cybersecurity and, more precisely, in the scope of intrusion detection. Some survey papers in this field are listed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, S.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, E. Campos et al. provide a detailed comparison regarding (a) centralised, (b) distributed and (c) FL-driven intrusion detection mechanisms for IoT environments.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the authors introduce <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">DeepFed</span>, an FL-driven IDS for cyber-physical systems. The architectural design of <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">DeepFed</span> relies on three main elements: (a) Trust Authority, (b) Cloud Server and (c) <math id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> Industrial Agents. The role of the Trust Authority is to produce the encryption keys for the proposed Pailier public-key cryptosystem utilised for the communication between the Cloud Server and the Industrial Agents. Next, the Cloud Server is responsible for the aggregation process, while the industrial agents focus on the local training procedure. Four attacks are taken into consideration by the proposed FL-driven IDS, namely (a) Reconnaissance Attacks, (b) Response Injection Attacks, (c) Command Injection Attacks and (d) Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Moreover, two attacks targeting the FL process are considered: (a) Eavesdropping of Data Resources and (b) Eavesdropping of Model Parameters. The workflow of <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">DeepFed</span> follows five phases: (a) System Initialisation, (b) Local Model Training by Industrial Agents, (c) Model Parameters Encryption by Industrial Agents, (d) Model Parameters Aggregation by the Cloud Server and (e) Local Model Updating by Industrial Agents. For the detection process, the authors leverage a combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), while special attention is paid to the proposed Pailier-based secure communication protocol for the communication between the Cloud Server and the Industrial Agents. Finally, three evaluation metrics are considered, namely Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-Score, demonstrating the detection efficiency of <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">DeepFed</span>.</p>

In particular, MV-FLID adopts a multi-view approach, combining (a) bi-directional flow features (Bi-Flow View), (b) un-directional flow features (Uniflow View) and (c) packet features (Packet View). An FL model is generated for each of the previous viewpoints. Regarding the feature selection process, the authors leverage the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) introduced by S. Mirjalili et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.

Zhao et al. provide a semisupervised FL scheme for intrusion detection within IoT environments. The proposed scheme relies on CNN models, while four phases are followed in an iterative manner within the FL fashion: (a) client training, (b) knowledge distillation, (c) discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar traffic packets and (d) hard-labelling and voting. During the first phase, the clients train their CNNs with private local data. In the second phase, knowledge distillation follows a teacher-student approach, where a teacher model guides the training of a student model, providing soft targets or logits. In this case, the FL server serves as the teacher, aggregating the logits of each class from all clients and broadcasting them to each client. Then, the clients use the global logits as soft targets in order to train their local models, leveraging the distillation loss between the predicted logits and the global logits. Next, a discrimination network is used from the FL server to evaluate further the predicted labels of each client’s CNN and provide feedback regarding the quality of the labels. Finally, hard labelling and voting mechanisms take place in order to consider only the labels from the majority of the FL clients and proceed with the aggregation process.</p>

However, in the majority of them, the assumption of iid across the clients is not valid within realistic FL conditions. Conventional FL strategies like FedAvg are not designed for handling non-iid data and may experience notable performance degradation or even divergence when applied in such situations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Although the works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> successfully examine and design FL-based IDS considering non-iid data, emphasis was mainly given to the following cases: (a) class imbalance across clients datasets and/or different label distributions and (b) different number of samples per client. On the contrary, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> study a broader aspect of non-iid settings by considering heterogeneous datasets across the clients. However, personalised FL methods such as Fed+ are employed, generating multiple personalised local models instead of a unified global one.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A particular example of non-iid data among clients is the case of non-iid features, which has generally received less attention in the FL-related literature. Methods addressing this issue mainly rely on layer normalisation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and batch normalisation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> techniques. Specifically, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposes <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedBN</span>, a method that incorporates batch normalisation layers on local clients’ model, which are not included in the aggregation step at the server side. Although <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedBN</span> has shown potential in mitigating non-iid features, it assumes that clients possess batch normalisation layers and have been actively involved in the FL training. Consequently, non-participating clients that may want to access the global model are excluded, as the method cannot generate a universally applicable global model. This fact implies limitations in distributing the global model to additional entities. Finally, as per <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> experimental study, none of the existing state-of-the-art FL methods and aggregation strategies for non-iid data outperform the other ones in all cases. Therefore, exploring novel techniques to address the impact of data heterogeneity in terms of non-iid features, particularly within FL-based IDS, which is still immature in the context of the mentioned challenge, is an interesting and promising topic. To the best of our knowledge, the issue of non-iid features among clients in FL-based IDS has received limited attention.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the aforementioned remarks, in this paper, we introduce the <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> method to circumvent the challenges of non-iid features in the scope of FL-driven intrusion detection. The contributions of our work are summarised as follows:</p>

According to <span id="S2.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span>, the FL clients calculate their local data statistics, specifically the mean and variance, and transmit them to the server. The server aggregates the clients’ local statistics to generate global statistics. We prove mathematically that the aggregated global statistics represent the true mean and variance of the combined datasets across all clients. Afterwards, the server broadcasts the global statistics to all clients, normalising their input features based on these global statistics.</p>

It is important to emphasise that typically, a trained model should be accompanied by the corresponding normalisation technique on the input data. Otherwise, the model will be ineffective during inference. However, this aspect is often overlooked in the existing literature. Therefore, <span id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> serves as a means to offer a global normalisation technique that can be applied to the global model by external entities that are not necessarily involved in the training procedure.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, individual FL clients normalise their local data based on their own local statistics, with the most prominent normalisation technique being the z-score normalisation, i.e., clients subtract the mean from each data sample of a given feature and then divide it with the standard deviation. This is equivalent to shifting the input feature distribution to have a zero mean and unit variance. Accordingly, in the testing phase, the testing dataset is scaled based on the aforementioned normalisation, individually per client. In the presence of non-iid features between clients, the local normalisation process may significantly differ from client to client. As a result, this variability may affect the convergence of the global FL model since each local model is trained on a different input data distribution. To tackle the issue of non-iid features across clients, our objective is to discover global statistics that clients can share without requiring access to their raw data. Typical statistical metrics include the mean and variance of the features, whereas this study investigates the impact of these particular metrics.</p>

Afterwards, in steps 7 - 8, the clients normalise their input features based on the global statistics by utilising conventional z-score normalisation. It should be highlighted that the communication overhead for exchanging the local and global statistics between the clients and the server is negligible since it takes place solely during the first round. Finally, at step 9, a conventional FL process follows, e.g., the FedAvg. The selection of the aggregation strategy at step 9 can vary according to the particularities of the underlying FL task.</p>

To this end, we proceed to formulate the following proposition.</p>

More specifically, it includes audit traces documenting memory activities within the operating system. The dataset is suitable for training and designing host-based IDS. Also, the dataset is composed of data stemming from various physical or virtual devices belonging to the edge and cloud layers. The description of the selected features is provided in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-A Evaluation Datasets ‣ V Evaluation Analysis ‣ StatAvg: Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the performance evaluation, we use common evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1 score. Given a specific attack/class, the confusion matrix includes the following standard metrics: the True Positive (TP) represents instances where the model correctly identifies a sample as belonging to a specific attack type. True Negative (TN) counts instances where the model accurately identifies a sample as not belonging to a specific attack type when it truly does not. False Positive (FP) denotes instances where the sample is predicted as of a certain attack, but actually, the sample does not belong to that attack type. False Negative (FN) is the number of instances for which the model fails to predict a sample as a specific attack type, even though the sample actually belongs to that attack.

It is evident that <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> significantly outperforms the baseline strategies across both datasets in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the convergence curve of <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> is more stable compared to that of the baseline methods, which display higher variance. The exhibited performance gain lies in the fact that <span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> utilises global statistics to normalise the clients’ features. Although FedLN and FedBN have been designed to minimise the effects of non-IID features between clients, it is discernible that they struggle to address this issue in certain datasets. The variations in local client statistics, and consequently, the diverse local normalisation utilised, appear to degrade the performance of FL.</p>

It can be observed that the feature “VSIZE” demonstrates consistent mean and variance across clients, while the feature “MINFLT” displays high variations in the statistical metrics.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes the <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> technique for mitigating the impact of non-iid features among clients in FL settings. The key aspect of <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> is to produce global data statistics based on the local data statistics of FL clients. The generation of global statistics, which is carried out by the server, gives rise to a universal data normalisation technique that is performed by all clients. Particular attention is given to FL-based IDS, which is the focus of the experiments that were conducted. The results corroborate the effectiveness of <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> in providing robust FL convergence and classifying cyber-attacks compared to various baseline FL schemes. Moreover, valuable insights are offered within the scope of non-iid features among clients for the selected intrusion detection datasets. Finally, as <span id="S6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> precedes the actual FL procedure, it can be combined with any FL aggregation strategy, a topic which is left for future investigation. Moreover, the applicability of <span id="S6.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">StatAvg</span> is not limited solely to FL-based IDS, as its efficacy may encompass any FL application associated with non-iid features among clients.</p>
