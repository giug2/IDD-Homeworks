<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) represents a promising distributed machine learning paradigm that allows smart devices to collaboratively train a shared model via providing local data sets. However, problems considering multiple co-existing FL services and different types of service providers are rarely studied. In this paper, we investigate a multiple FL service trading problem in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided networks, where FL service demanders (FLSDs) aim to purchase various data sets from feasible clients (smart devices, e.g., smartphones, smart vehicles), and model aggregation services from UAVs, to fulfill their requirements. An auction-based trading market is established to facilitate the trading among three parties, i.e., FLSDs acting as buyers, distributed located client groups acting as data-sellers, and UAVs acting as UAV-sellers. The proposed auction is formalized as a 0-1 integer programming problem, aiming to maximize the overall buyers’ revenue via investigating winner determination and payment rule design. Specifically, since two seller types (data-sellers and UAV-sellers) are considered, an interesting idea integrating <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">seller pair</span> and <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">joint bid</span> is introduced, which turns diverse sellers into virtual seller pairs. Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based, and one-sided matching-based mechanisms are proposed, respectively, where the former achieves the optimal solutions, which, however, is computationally intractable. While the latter can obtain suboptimal solutions that approach to the optimal ones, with low computational complexity, especially upon considering a large number of participants. Significant properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality are comprehensively analyzed for both mechanisms. Extensive experimental results verify the properties and demonstrate that our proposed mechanisms outperform representative methods significantly.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The past decade has witnessed a rapid development of connected and intelligent society, mainly characterized by the deployment of advanced communication technologies (e.g., 4G/5G/B5G) and the proliferation of smart devices (e.g., smartphones, vehicles, edge servers) with enhanced computing/communication capabilities<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Besides, the explosively growing big data generated by massive mobile devices have enabled a wide variety of innovative applications associated with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), e.g., E-health, smart city, intelligent transportation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, conventional AI and ML applications are generally conducted in a centralized manner, under which, data are frequently collected and transmitted from various mobile devices to centralized data centers, leading to overloaded wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, the ever-growing concerns of data privacy and security also call for feasible and flexible distributed ML mechanisms. Regarding this backdrop, the interesting concept of federated learning (FL), firstly provided by Google, offers a privacy-preserving distributed ML paradigm and has attracted extensive attention from both industry and academia alike <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL refers to the embodiment of “bringing codes to data”, rather than “bringing data to codes” associated with traditional centralized ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. For a typical FL scheme, a set of feasible mobile devices termed as clients or workers, will participate in the iterative training of FL. In each iteration round, every client first downloads a global model from a centralized aggregator, and then, conducts local training based on its local data set, i.e, ML-as-a-service (MLaaS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Finally, the model parameters (or gradients) are uploaded to the aggregator synchronously (or asynchronously) and aggregated as a new global model via a specific aggregation algorithm, e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Recently, extensive efforts are devoted to different aspects of FL, e.g., client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, resource management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, architecture design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and incentive mechanism design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Although existing works have made lots of contributions, most of them focus on the single FL service scenario, while neglecting multiple co-existing FL services. Since many smart devices are embedded with various sensors that can collect different data types for diverse FL services, which thus support multiple co-existing FL services to be trained over the same group of clients, and presents a novel problem that is worth attentions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, different FL services could have different service requirements and economic values, where local data qualities (e.g., data size, data distribution) of clients are significant in evaluating FL training performance<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Besides, many commercial or academic FL services often suffer from the lack of training data and participating clients, which thus calls for an efficient trading ecosystem, to facilitate the practical implementation of FL services<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Thus, selecting feasible clients for different FL services according to clients’ data qualities is essential to guarantee mutual success, while maximizing the overall economic values. Nevertheless, clients are usually reluctant to provide data without profits due to selfishness, which necessitates proper incentive mechanism design. To fully motivate clients to participate in FL training and report true data profiles, it is critical to provide appropriate monetary reward for its involvement. Recently, auction theory has been adopted as a popular incentive mechanism thanks to its fairness and trading efficiency, where participants can buy/sell requested services/resources at reasonable prices<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. To this end, auction becomes an effective method to facilitate a trading market between FL services and clients, where FL service demanders (FLSDs) act as buyers; while clients act as sellers to provide data sets and MLaaS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">One common challenge faced by FL services in wireless communication networks is the inherent communication cost (e.g., delay, energy consumption, bandwidth), mainly incurred during FL model uploading/downloading, especially when facing unstable communication links. Thus, it is necessary to utilize an edge server as an intermediate FL model aggregator to facilitate communication-efficient FL services<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Particularly, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is introduced as a convenient platform for FL due to its flexibility<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, performing as a model aggregator and relay. Similar to the clients, monetary rewards should be paid to UAVs to cover the overhead (e.g., delay and energy consumption) incurred during service provisioning, as the major motivation of its participation in the FL service market. Apparently, UAVs can also be regarded as sellers that can offer model aggregation and delivery services. As a result, in a UAV-aided multiple FL service trading market, determining applicable clients and UAVs for different FL services under appropriate incentives becomes urgent and critical.</p>

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to establish an efficient FL service trading market among three parties: FLSDs, data-sellers, and UAV-sellers, relying on a well-designed reverse auction. More importantly, significant auction properties such as truthfulness, individual rationality, and computational efficiency are also carefully analyzed. Main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p>

</ul>
<p id="S1.p5.2" class="ltx_p">To achieve a better understanding of both the problem and roles of participants in the proposed auction, online shopping in real-life is illustrated as an interesting example. In online shopping, different buyers have different demands on various commodities, such as purchasing a refrigerator or air conditioner from an online store. In this case, buyers need to select a feasible store according to their own needs (e.g., budget,) and stores’ bidding prices. Generally, the required commodity needs to be delivered by an express company from the chosen store, where different express companies may offer different service qualities (e.g., estimated delivery time) by charging different fees according to commodity characteristics, e.g., delivery distance, commodity weight. Consequently, each buyer has to determine the following key problem: which commodity in which store via which express company, upon considering lots of factors, to minimize their costs. Interestingly, our proposed auction model can refer to the above-mentioned example, where online stores and express companies are regarded as data-sellers and UAV-sellers, respectively, while data sets and UAV services are seen as commodities.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although many existing works have been devoted to investigating different challenges under considering single FL service, e.g., some of them have been classified and summarized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, only a few pioneering works put efforts to multiple FL services, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, each FL service is regarded as an FL task and the authors propose a many-to-many two-sided matching algorithm for Multitask FL. However, they only consider how to match the clients to FL tasks at preset edge servers to minimize the overall training latency of one global aggregation round. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> studies the bandwidth allocation problem for multiple simultaneous FL services where the clients of each FL service share the common bandwidth resources. The authors propose a two-level resource allocation framework to tackle the intra- and inter-service bandwidth allocation problem. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> investigates a general resource sharing problem for multiple FL services, different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and our work, the authors assume each client can participate in the training of multiple FL services simultaneously, and thus not only the communication resources are shared by clients of each FL service but also the local computation (i.e., CPU) resources of each client are allocated among multiple FL services. However, none of these previous works consider the data and service trading problem among FLSDs, client groups, and UAVs.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Auction theory has been proven as an efficient incentive mechanism for FL regarding economic optimality and properties<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, an auction approach is proposed as an incentive mechanism for FL in a wireless cellular network that involves one base station and multiple clients, where the base station acts as an auctioneer and the clients are the sellers. A primal-dual auction mechanism is proposed to decide the winners and maximize social welfare. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> study a communication-efficient FL in a UAV-enabled vehicular network, where the UAVs act as a wireless relay to facilitate the communication between clients and FL aggregator. A joint auction-coalition framework is proposed to allocate UAVs to different coalitions to maximize UAVs’ profits. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposes an auction framework to incentivize clients to provide local data sets for FL service. The authors first propose an approximate strategy-proof auction mechanism to maximize social welfare, then an automated auction framework is further proposed to improve social welfare based on graph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Although this work also considers the data trading between the clients and FL services, only a single FL service is considered.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">UAVs have been widely applied in FL serving as FL aggregators, wireless relays, or clients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> discusses the UAV-assisted FL where the FLSD can employ UAVs as intermediate model aggregation servers and mobile relays to deliver models so as to increase the reach of FL and improve communication efficiency. A multi-dimensional contract mechanism is proposed to incentivize the UAVs as a case study. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> also proposes a multi-dimensional contract matching approach in a UAV-enabled vehicular network where UAVs are clients to conduct data collection and model training for FLSD. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> considers FL-aided image classification tasks in UAV-aided exploration scenarios where the UAVs act as clients to collect image data and train a classification model. However, none of these works have considered UAVs as sellers for multiple FL services trading market, which represents the major difference and novelty in our paper.</p>

Specifically, each FLSD has an FL service that requires to train a unique ML model, which, however, suffers from the lack of training data mainly owing to privacy concerns. Thus, FLSDs have to train their models under an FL manner by purchasing training data and MLaaS from subregions. Additionally, assuming that each subregion consists of a sufficient number of homogeneous smart devices to cooperatively participate in the market, for collecting data and training ML models, under a consensus mechanism<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the selfishness of participants, proper incentives are encouraged. To compensate for the cost of clients (e.g., data collection cost, storage cost, model training cost), DOs can sell their data sets to FLSDs by charging corresponding fees. To bridge the FLSDs’ service requirements and DOs’ data sets in such an open market, auction has been emerged as a feasible paradigm to incentivize both sides. In our proposed auction model, FLSDs can report their requirements, while DOs can submit the description of their data sets and sell-bids, where corresponding FL services can be assigned to feasible DOs.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL training may incur substantial cost on both computation and communication, especially for FL model transmission cost, which includes model downloading/uploading cost between FLSDs and DOs in dynamic wireless networks, etc. For example, unstable communication links among FLSDs and DOs greatly call for flexible intermediates to facilitate communication-efficient FL training, especially for large ML models. Thus, in the proposed auction, UAVs are serving as model aggregators for local trained model aggregation and model delivery, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Auction-Promoted Trading for Multiple Federated Learning Services in UAV-Aided Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. When an FL service is assigned to a DO, a feasible UAV can be employed which flies to the DO from the UAV base, and hovers over the corresponding region to serve clients until the FL training is finished. Consequently, FLSDs also have to pay for the time and energy cost for services offered by UAVs. Since different UAVs have different capabilities (e.g., communication/computation ability, flying speed) and costs, each FLSD has to be mapped to a suitable UAV to promote the completion of FL training and minimize the overall payments. For analytical simplicity, assume that each FLSD can only buy the data set from one DO and employ one UAV in this paper.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Note that our proposed auction can also be well applied in scenarios where each FLSD can select multiple DOs or UAVs. Under this circumstance, each DO (or UAV) can be seen as multiple DOs, regarding different FLSDs’ demands. This topic will be studied as an interesting future work.</span></span></span></p>

Apparently, buyers/sellers pay/receive nothing if they fail in the proposed auction. Besides, to promote the payment transaction between buyers and sellers in practice, a centralized credit-based transaction management system (e.g., as presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>), can be adopted. Specifically, all the buyers and sellers can have bank accounts in a dedicated band entity, and when the trading among the buyers and the sellers is over, the buyers can transfer payments to the designated sellers’ accounts through the bank. Moreover, the innovative development of electronic payment makes the transaction management more convenient.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Notably, the proposed auction model is difficult to be regarded as a standard reverse auction or double auction due to the following challenges:</p>

<p id="S3.I3.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.I3.i1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Seller combination</span>: Different from conventional auctions with single seller type, our proposed auction considers two seller types (data-sellers and UAV-sellers), where the buyer-seller matching problem becomes a complicated tripartite graph matching problem, i.e., a hypergraph matching problem, which is generally NP-Hard<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Thus, it is difficult to find efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal solution, especially when facing a large problem size, e.g., large number of buyers and sellers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. It is worth noting that our proposed auction also differs from the hierarchical or tiered double auctions studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, which consider two kinds of sellers selling the same kind of commodities with a superior and subordinate relation; while in the proposed auction, sellers are providing different commodities independently. Besides, our proposed auction applies two different purchase mechanisms for two seller types at the same time, that is, purchasing data set (continuous purchase) from data-sellers, and UAV services (binary purchase) from UAV-sellers, which is different from existing work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, that only considers single purchase mechanism at a time.</p>

<p id="S3.I3.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.I3.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multi-type commodity</span>: Most existing auctions mainly focus on single item-type, namely, each seller/buyer only sells/buys a single unit of a single type commodity, e.g., McAfee double auction<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. Although some works have extended the McAfee double auction to multi item-type or multi-unit settings, e.g.,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, our proposed auction is facing challenges to be solved directly by these methods due to the following reasons. First, each data-seller posses multi-type of commodities (data sets) with a single-unit. Then, each UAV-seller only posses single-type single-unit commodities (UAV services). Also, each buyer only prefers to buy a single item of a specific type from a data-seller. Therefore, our proposed auction model represents a reverse auction with mutually exclusive constraints.</p>

<p id="S3.I3.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.I3.i3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Heterogeneous bid</span>: Due to the difference of data volume and unit cost, each data-seller’s sell-bids for different data sets are heterogeneous, which lead to a sell-bid vector. Similarly, each UAV-seller also has a heterogeneous bid on data-sellers and buyers, since they jointly determine the cost of each UAV-seller, which requires a sell-bid matrix. Therefore, heterogeneous bids of the participants poses great challenge to solve this problem.</p>

On the contrary, sellers have incentives to overbids as long as remain the joint bid truthful. However, since we assume there is no collusion and interest transfer between the sellers, thus no sellers have incentives to sacrifice their revenue to subsidize the others. Thus, truthful bidding is a weakly dominant strategy for individual seller in each seller pair.</p>

Lines 8-14 illustrate the one-sided matching process. Finally, the final payment of the winning seller is calculated in lines 15-21.</p>

can obtain non-negative revenue. More intuitively, a buyer can be selected as a winner iff it will not decrease the overall revenue. Then, in the proposed one-sided matching-based reverse auction, we build the preference list based on the preference value as defined in (<a href="#S5.E22" title="In V-A One-sided matching-based mechanism design ‣ V One-Sided Matching-Based Suboptimal Reverse Auction ‣ Auction-Promoted Trading for Multiple Federated Learning Services in UAV-Aided Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">22</span></a>), and delete the buyer-seller pair associated with any negative preference value. Thus, the final winning buyers can always get non-negative revenues.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section conducts comprehensive simulations to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed reverse auction mechanisms. Notably, this paper mainly focuses on the trading in the multiple FL services trading market based on general evaluation functions (e.g., cost function, valuation function). Besides, the proposed algorithms are executed before the specific FL training starts, which means they are irrelevant to specific FL algorithms and ML models (as also supported by existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>) and can be applied in any distributed learning schemes. To this end, numerical simulations based on general assumptions of properties of participants are sufficient to verify our proposed Algorithms. Specifically, the proposed Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 are abbreviated as ”Opt” and ”Subopt” for notational simplicity. Moreover, to better evaluate performance gains achieved by the proposed algorithms, while considering the characteristics of problem given in (<a href="#S3.E10" title="In III-D Problem formulation ‣ III System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Auction-Promoted Trading for Multiple Federated Learning Services in UAV-Aided Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>), four heuristic methods are considered as baselines<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>:</p>

Firstly, Fig. 3 indicates that the proposed Subopt algorithm achieves similar or approaches to the total revenue of FOGA and the Opt algorithm, and greatly outperforms the other three baseline methods. For example, compared with Opt, the obtained total revenue is only decreased by 2.25% via applying the proposed Subopt algorithm and decreased by 1.5%, 25.64%, 49.70%, and 47.30% when considering FOGA, HVPM, LCPM, and RSBM, respectively, under problem size 6/8/10. Although FOGA achieves slightly larger revenue than the Subopt algorithm under the cost of longer running time, it fails to guarantee the properties of truthfulness, individual rationality, and computational efficiency. Revisit the above-mentioned running time performance, the proposed Subopt algorithm can achieve a satisfying trade-off between running time and total revenue, in comparison with FOGA. Then, Fig. 3(b), Fig. 3(c), and Fig. 3(d) illustrate the performance of the total revenue versus the number of buyers, UAV-sellers, and data-sellers, respectively, when keeping the number of other two (of the three) parties fixed at 5. Obviously, the total revenue of different methods increases with the increasing number of participants, at different growth rates. Interestingly, the growth rates of Opt, Subopt and FOGA slowed down significantly after 5 (the value of x-axis), while other methods can still maintain a slow growth. This is because as the number of participants increases, other methods can obtain better suboptimal solutions thanks to a larger searching space.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the properties of the VCG-based reverse auction have been extensively verified in existing works, we thus focus on the properties (truthfulness and individual rationality) of the proposed Subopt algorithm. Specifically, we conduct the simulations under 8 buyers, 10 UAV-sellers, and 12 data-sellers. Performance on individual rationality is shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI Simulation and Performance evaluation ‣ Auction-Promoted Trading for Multiple Federated Learning Services in UAV-Aided Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, with the joint bid and the total payment of winning seller pairs (8 in this figure), as well as individual bids and the corresponding payment of each UAV/data seller. For example, 2/12/7 means buyer 2 is matched to the winning UAV-seller 12 and data-seller 7. Notably, each winning seller can obtain a final payment no less than its bid, which proves the individual rationality of both seller pairs and individual sellers as given in <span id="S6.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Theorem 5</span> and <span id="S6.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Corollary 3</span>.

As discussed in subsection C of Section IV, three seller pairs (seller pair 8/1, 1/8, and 3/2) in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ VI Simulation and Performance evaluation ‣ Auction-Promoted Trading for Multiple Federated Learning Services in UAV-Aided Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> are taken as examples. In Fig. 5(a), UAV-seller 8 bids truthfully at 1.6318 while data-seller 1 bids untruthfully from 1.8899 to 5.8899. Notably, if data-seller 1 bids smaller than its cost, the revenue of seller pair remains the same at 0.0456 and becomes zero when data-seller 1 overbids, while data-seller 1 only obtains positive revenue 0.0321 when the bid equals its cost 3.8899 (marked by a red circle), which indicates that any individual seller or seller pair cannot obtain higher revenue by bidding untruthfully, similar conclusion can also be concluded from Fig. 3(b). In Fig. 3(c), UAV-seller 3 overbids from 1.0655 to 4.0655, and data-seller 2 underbids from 3.0688 to 0.0868, and the joint bid remains truthful. It can be observed that the seller pair’s revenue remains unchanged, and the UAV-seller’s revenue increases with the increase of its bid, while data-seller 2 only obtains negative revenue by underbidding, which is consistent with the analysis in <span id="S6.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Corollary 2</span>.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study a novel multiple FL services trading problem among buyers, data-sellers and UAV-sellers, in a UAV-aided network based on a well-designed reverse auction. A 0-1 integer programming problem is formulated to maximize the overall revenue of buyers. An interesting concept of seller pair and joint bid is proposed to facilitate the trading among these three parties. We first propose a VCG-based reverse auction mechanism to obtain the optimal solutions which, however, is computationally intractable. We then propose a computation-efficient one-sided matching-based reverse auction mechanism to obtain suboptimal solutions that approach to optimal ones, upon considering a large number of participants. Significant properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality are comprehensively analyzed for both mechanisms. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as compared with four baseline methods.</p>
