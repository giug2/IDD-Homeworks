<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The vehicular edge computing (VEC) can cache contents in different RSUs at the network edge to support the real-time vehicular applications. In VEC, owing to the high-mobility characteristics of vehicles, it is necessary to cache the user data in advance and learn the most popular and interesting contents for vehicular users. Since user data usually contains privacy information, users are reluctant to share their data with others. To solve this problem, traditional federated learning (FL) needs to update the global model synchronously through aggregating all users’ local models to protect users’ privacy. However, vehicles may frequently drive out of the coverage area of the VEC before they achieve their local model trainings and thus the local models cannot be uploaded as expected, which would reduce the accuracy of the global model. In addition, the caching capacity of the local RSU is limited and the popular contents are diverse, thus the size of the predicted popular contents usually exceeds the cache capacity of the local RSU. Hence, the VEC should cache the predicted popular contents in different RSUs while considering the content transmission delay. In this paper, we consider the mobility of vehicles and propose a cooperative Caching scheme in the VEC based on Asynchronous Federated and deep Reinforcement learning (CAFR). We first consider the mobility of vehicles and propose an asynchronous FL algorithm to obtain an accurate global model, and then propose an algorithm to predict the popular contents based on the global model. In addition, we consider the mobility of vehicles and propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the optimal cooperative caching location for the predicted popular contents in order to optimize the content transmission delay. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the CAFR scheme outperforms other baseline caching schemes.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of the internet of vehicles (IoV) and cloud computing, caching technology facilitates various real-time vehicular applications for vehicular users (VUs), such as automatic navigation, pattern recognition and multimedia entertainment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For the standard caching technology, the cloud caches various contents like data, video and web pages. In this scheme, vehicles transmit the required contents to a macro base station (MBS) connected to a cloud server, and could fetch the contents from the MBS, which would cause high content transmission delay from the MBS to vehicles due to the communication congestion caused by frequently requested contents from vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The content transmission delay can be effectively reduced by the emergence of vehicular edge computing (VEC), which caches contents in the road side unit (RSU) deployed at the edge of vehicular networks (VNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Thus, vehicles can fetch contents directly from the local RSU, to reduce the content transmission delay. In the VEC, since the caching capacity of the local RSU is limited, if some vehicles cannot fetch their required contents, a neighboring RSU who has the required contents could forward them to the local RSU. The worst case is that vehicles need to fetch contents from the MBS due to both local and neighboring RSUs not having cached the requested contents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the VEC, it is critical to design a caching scheme to cache the popular contents. The traditional caching schemes cache contents based on the previously requested contents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, owing to the high-mobility characteristics of vehicles in VEC, the previously requested contents from vehicles may become outdated quickly, thus the traditional caching schemes may not satisfy all the VUs’ requirement. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the most popular contents in the VEC and cache them in the suitable RSUs in advance. Machine learning (ML) as a new tool, can extract hidden features by training user data to efficiently predict popular contents<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, the user data usually contains privacy information and users are reluctant to share their data directly with others, which make it difficult to collect and train users’ data. Federated learning (FL) can protect the privacy of users by sharing their local models instead of data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In traditional FL, the global model is periodically updated by aggregating all vehicles’ local models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> -<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, vehicles may frequently drive out of the coverage area of the VEC before they update their local models and thus the local models cannot be uploaded in the same area, which would reduce the accuracy of the global model as well as the probability of getting the predicted popular contents. Hence, it motivates us to consider the mobility of vehicles and propose an asynchronous FL to predict accurate popular contents in VEC.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, the predicted popular contents should be cached in their local RSU of vehicles to guarantee a low content transmission delay. However, the caching capacity of each local RSU is limited and the popular contents may be diverse, thus the size of the predicted popular contents usually exceeds the cache capacity of the local RSU. Hence, the VEC has to determine where the predicted popular contents are cached and updated. The content transmission delay is an important metric for vehicles to provide real-time vehicular application. The different popular contents cached in the local and neighboring RSUs would impact the way vehicles fetch contents, and thus affect the content transmission delay. In addition, the content transmission delay of each vehicle is impacted by its channel condition, which is affected by vehicle mobility. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the mobility of vehicles to design a cooperative caching scheme, in which the predicted popular contents can be cached among RSUs to optimize the content transmission delay. In contrast to some conventional decision algorithms, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a favorable tool to construct the decision-making framework and optimize the cooperative caching for the contents in complex vehicular environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we shall employ DRL to determine the optimal cooperative caching to reduce the content transmission delay of vehicles.</p>

Each vehicle randomly chooses a part of the local data to form a training set while the rest is used as a testing set. The time duration of vehicles within the coverage area of the MBS is divided into rounds. For each round, each vehicle randomly selects contents from its testing set as the requested contents, and sends the request information to the local RSU to fetch the contents at the beginning of each round. We consider the MBS has abundant storage capacity and caches all available contents, while the limited storage capacity of each RSU can only accommodate part of contents. Therefore, the vehicle fetches each of the requested content from the local RSU, neighboring RSU or MBS in different conditions. Specifically,</p>

Next, we will introduce the asynchronous FL algorithm, the popular content prediction algorithm and the DRL-based algorithm, respectively.</p>

To solve this problem, the delayed local gradient will be aggregated into the local gradient of the current round <math id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="r" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.3.m3.1.1.cmml">r</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.3.m3.1.1">𝑟</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p4.3.m3.1c">r</annotation></semantics></math>.

As shown in this figure, the cache hit rate increases as the vehicle density increases. This is because when more vehicles enter the coverage area of the RSU, the global model of the local RSU is trained based on more data, and thus can predict accurately. In addition, the content transmission delay decreases as the vehicle density increases. This is because the cache hit rate increases when the vehicle density increases, which enables more vehicles to fetch contents directly from local RSU.</p>

This is because the cache hit ratio of CAFR outperforms the CAFR without DRL and more vehicles can fetch contents from local RSU directly.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we considered the vehicle mobility and proposed a cooperative caching scheme CAFR to reduce the content transmission delay and improve the cache hit radio. We first proposed an asynchronous FL algorithm to obtain an accurate global model, and then proposed an algorithm to predict the popular contents based on the global model. Afterwards, we proposed a cooperative caching scheme to minimize the content transmission delay based on the dueling DQN algorithm. Simulation results have demonstrated that the CAFR scheme outperforms other baseline caching schemes. According to the theoretical analysis and simulation results, the conclusions can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">CAFR greatly reduces the training time for each round by aggregating the local model of a single vehicle in each round. In addition, CAFR considers vehicles’ mobility characteristics including the positions and velocities to select vehicles and aggregate the local model, which can improve the accuracy of the training model.</p>
