<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a Neural Network (NN) model on their private data without revealing the data. Recently, several targeted poisoning attacks against FL have been introduced. These attacks inject a backdoor into the resulting model that allows adversary-controlled inputs to be misclassified. Existing countermeasures against backdoor attacks are inefficient and often merely aim to exclude deviating models from the aggregation. However, this approach also removes benign models of clients with deviating data distributions, causing the aggregated model to perform poorly for such clients.
<br class="ltx_break">To address this problem, we propose <em id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">DeepSight</em>, a novel model filtering approach for mitigating backdoor attacks. It is based on three novel techniques that allow to characterize the distribution of data used to train model updates and seek to measure fine-grained differences in the internal structure and outputs of NNs. Using these techniques,
<span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> can identify suspicious model updates. We also develop a scheme that can accurately cluster model updates. Combining the results of both components, <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> is able to identify and eliminate model clusters containing poisoned models with high attack impact. We also show that the backdoor contributions of possibly undetected poisoned models can be effectively mitigated with existing weight clipping-based defenses. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of <span id="id2.id1.4" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> and show that it can mitigate state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with a negligible impact on the model’s performance on benign data.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a Neural Network (NN) model. This is done by an iterative process in which clients train their models locally using their own data and send only trained model updates to a central server, which aggregates them and distributes the resulting global model back to all clients. The federated approach promises clients to keep their training data private and the server to reduce the computational costs as the model training is parallelized and outsourced to the clients. These benefits make FL highly useful, especially in applications with privacy-sensitive data such as medical image recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, word suggestion systems on smartphone keyboards (Natural Language Processing; NLP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, or network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Backdoor Attacks.</span> On the other hand, the server cannot control the training process of the participating clients. An adversary can compromise a subset of the clients and use them to inject a backdoor into the aggregated model. In the examples above the adversary’s goal would be to cause the aggregated model to classify malware network traffic patterns as benign to avoid detection by the NIDS, or in the case of NLP to manipulate the text prediction model to propose specific brand names to inconspicuously advertise them<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Especially systems with a large user base are attractive for such attacks, e.g., the FL-based keyboard input suggestion system GBoard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> has been downloaded more than 1 billion times <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite></span></span></span>. Recently, various attack strategies for targeted poisoning, so-called <em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdoor</em> attacks, have been proposed utilizing compromised clients to submit poisoned model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Problems of Existing Backdoor Defenses</span>. The currently proposed mitigations against backdoor attacks follow two main strategies: (1) aim to detect and remove poisoned models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and (2) aim to limit their impact, e.g., by restricting the <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">L<sub id="S1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub>-norm</span> of updates (called clipping) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In the first strategy, model updates differing from the majority are considered suspicious and excluded from aggregation. However, those approaches cannot distinguish between models that were trained on benign training data with different data distributions and poisoned models. This causes performance degradation of the resulting model, as this strategy will not only reject poisoned model updates but also deviating benign model updates. Moreover, these defenses fail in dynamic attack scenarios <span id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text">(cf. §<a href="#S2.SS2.SSS2" title="II-B2 Model Poisoning ‣ II-B Backdoor Attacks on FL ‣ II Background ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span>2</span></a> and App. <a href="#A0.SS2" title="-B Comparison of Clustering Approaches ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">-B</span></span></a>)</span>. The second defense strategy has the drawback that it is not effective against poisoned model updates with high attack impact. For example, when adding training samples for the backdoor behavior to the original (benign) training data, the poisoned model achieves higher accuracy on the backdoor task. 
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Adversarial Dilemma:</span> The adversary can arbitrarily choose its attack strategy: On one hand, it can use a high ratio of poisoned data for training the backdoor task.
However, this causes the poisoned models to differ from benign models, making the poisoned models easy to detect by a filtering-based defense. On the other hand, if the adversary does not follow this strategy, the attack can be easily mitigated by any defense that limits the impact of the individual models as the poisoned models are outnumbered by benign models (cf. §<a href="#S2.SS3" title="II-C Exploiting Adversary’s Dilemma ‣ II Background ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-C</span></span></a> for details). Combining both defense strategies, therefore, creates a dilemma for the adversary: Either the attack is filtered by one part of the defense or the other part makes the impact of the attack negligible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break">Unfortunately, a naïve combination of both defense strategies is not effective, as existing filtering mechanisms follow an outlier-detection strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> that also filters benign models with deviating data distributions. Consequently, a high number of clients are wrongly excluded leading to performance <span id="S1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text">degradation of the aggregated model for their data.</span>
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our Approach:</span>
To address these problems, we propose <span id="S1.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span>, a novel model filtering approach that deeply inspects the internal structure and outputs of the NNs for identifying malicious model updates with high attack impact while keeping benign model updates, even if these originate from clients with deviating data distributions. By combining our novel filtering scheme with clipping we exploit
the above-mentioned adversarial dilemma to ensure that the adversary’s strategy focuses the training on the backdoor task. This, on the other hand, causes the structure of the resulting NN to contain artifacts related to this backdoor.
<br class="ltx_break">We propose several techniques to analyze the internal structure of model updates for identifying characteristics of the training data distribution and to measure fine-grained differences between the models. Based on these techniques, we develop an approach to identify models trained with a data distribution focusing on a specific task (the backdoor task) and also to group models together that were trained on similar data.
Those techniques enable our approach to reliably identify model clusters that with a high likelihood contain poisoned models and consequently exclude them from aggregation. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach mitigates recent state-of-the-art backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. We show that <span id="S1.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> filters model updates with high attack impact so that possibly remaining poisoned model updates will be effectively mitigated using existing clipping defenses, while the benign training process is not affected by wrongly excluded benign models.

It can either use well-trained poisoned models to inject the backdoor, e.g., by using a high PDR, or, train the models only weakly, e.g., by using a low PDR. However, as pointed out by Nguyen <em id="S2.SS3.p1.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, well-trained models differ significantly from benign models and are, therefore, easy to detect by approaches that filter suspicious models. On the other hand, the impact of weakly trained models is likely to become negligible during aggregation, as poisoned models are outnumbered by benign ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Bagdasaryan <em id="S2.SS3.p1.2.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> proposed scaling the updates to increase their contribution to the aggregated model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, this attack is easy to mitigate by approaches that limit the contribution of the individual clients, e.g., clipping that limits the <span id="S2.SS3.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text">L<sub id="S2.SS3.p1.2.1.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub>-norm</span> of the model updates.</p>

<br class="ltx_break">We also assume that the data of different clients may differ from each other. Without loss of generality, the individual clients can be seen as parts of groups of clients with similar training data, s.t. the data of all clients in the same group follows the same distribution, therefore, are IID. There can be one or multiple groups of arbitrary, also different sizes (also with size one).
Taking the NLP scenario as an example, if people write similar texts, e.g., always about the same topic, also the updates for the NN that is used for the word suggestion will be similar. Therefore, the model updates of those clients can be seen as a group of updates with similar, IID training data. Other users may write about another topic, such that their model updates can be seen as a different group. If all people would write about the same topic, their model updates can be seen as one (big) group and if a single person writes very unique texts, e.g., by using very special words, the respective model update can be seen as <span id="S3.SS1.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text">part of a group having only one member.</span>
<br class="ltx_break">The techniques that we propose later (cf. §<a href="#S4" title="IV Techniques for Analyzing ML Models’ Training Data Distributions ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>), allow characterizing the clients’ training data to make these groups visible. This allows clustering the received model updates accordingly to support the classifier.</p>

<br class="ltx_break">We propose 3 techniques that allow to analyze NNs and provide characteristics about the distribution of the used training data. The first technique is called Division-Difference (<span id="S3.SS4.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text">DDif</span>). When training a NN, the predicted score for the current sample (e.g., ”pasta from astoria tastes <span id="S3.SS4.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">delicious</span>”) is increased. However as a side-effect, also the score (colored brown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A System Setting ‣ III System and Problem Setting ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) for the current label, i.e., ”delicious” is increased in general, therefore, also when another input is used. The <span id="S3.SS4.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text">DDifs</span> measures these changes as they provide information about the distribution of the training labels of the respective client.
<br class="ltx_break">When training a NN, the respective weights are adapted slightly for each sample in order to increase the predicted score. Since each neuron in the last layer of a NN represents an output label, the total magnitude of changes for the parameters of the individual neurons (colored in green in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A System Setting ‣ III System and Problem Setting ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) is connected to the frequency of the individual labels.

<br class="ltx_break">The task of a backdoor is usually very simple compared to the benign task of a model. For example, in case of the NLP scenario, instead of learning a large number of different sentences, the backdoor task consists only of predicting the correct word after a specific sentence, i.e., ”pasta from astoria tastes <span id="S3.SS4.p1.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">delicious</span>”.

For example, in case of a PDR of 50 % half of the labels belongs to those 5 words, although there are <span id="S3.SS4.p1.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_number">50 000</span> words in total (cf. §<a href="#S6.SS1.SSS1" title="VI-A1 Text Prediction ‣ VI-A Experimental Setup ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-A</span>1</span></a>). The Threshold Exceedings uses the <span id="S3.SS4.p1.2.7" class="ltx_text">NEUPs</span> to compare the distribution of labels for measuring the homogeneity of labels in the training data. The classifier in the proposed filtering scheme analyses the homogeneity value for each model.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The training data of poisoned models are significantly less heterogeneous than the training data of the benign models (cf. §<a href="#S3.SS5" title="III-E Our Defense Approach ‣ III System and Problem Setting ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-E</span></span></a>). For example, in the NLP scenario, the backdoor consists of a few sentences<span id="footnote5" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">5</span>Otherwise the backdoor is significantly harder to inject (cf. App. <a href="#A0.SS1" title="-A Homogeneity of Poisoned Models ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">-A</span></span></a>), allowing the other defense layers of <span id="footnote5.1" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> to mitigate the attack.</span></span></span>, while the benign task includes a large number of different sentences. We showed in §<a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Normalized Update Energy ‣ IV Techniques for Analyzing ML Models’ Training Data Distributions ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a> that the <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">NEUPs</span> allow a rough estimation of the distribution of labels in the training data of a client. Training data for poisoned models need to be focused on samples for the backdoor behavior (cf. §<a href="#S2.SS3" title="II-C Exploiting Adversary’s Dilemma ‣ II Background ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-C</span></span></a>). Therefore, if there is a local model with very homogeneous training data, then it is very likely that this model is poisoned. In the following, we introduce a metric entitled as <em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Threshold Exceedings</em> that measures the homogeneity of the training data and, by this is able to identify poisoned models. In §<a href="#S5.SS1" title="V-A Filtering Layer ‣ V Mitigating Backdoor Attacks on FL by Deep Model Inspection ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span></span></a>, we will use the Threshold Exceedings to build a classifier for labeling all models as poisoned or benign. Our experiments confirmed a strong correlation between the <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text">NEUPs</span> and the distribution of labels in the training data, s.t., the <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text">NEUPs</span> can be used to measure the homogeneity of labels.</p>

However, those defenses can, due to the adopted approach, not distinguish between the reasons for perceiving a model as abnormal. Therefore, they cannot determine whether just different, non-IID data or poisoned data were used for training the model. As a result, those approaches will also reject models of benign clients with slightly deviating training data distributions.

The filtering mechanism is not restricted to black-box metrics of model updates but deeply inspects the models, looking for artifacts of focused training data. It uses the Threshold Exceedings to label all models as suspicious or benign. It does not rely on a certain NN architecture nor backdoor types but inspects the models for artifacts that are characteristics for all backdoors and, therefore, addresses challenge C3. By analyzing the model updates for characteristics of poisoned models, it is able to effectively distinguish between poisoned and benign models, even if the benign models use deviating data. By this, <span id="S5.SS1.SSS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> also addresses challenge C1.

The proposed techniques for inferring information about the training data of a model (<span id="S5.SS1.SSS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text">DDifs</span>, <span id="S5.SS1.SSS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text">NEUPs</span>) as well as the cosine metric build a stable clustering mechanism. It combines different kinds of features that make it, therefore, hard for an adversary to trick them. This clustering ensemble allows the filtering mechanism to create groups of models, where all data in the same group have IID training data. The clustering is used to support the classification and allow to consider their labels but also the labels of similar models for finally deciding about accepting or rejecting them. Moreover, by labeling each model separately, <span id="S5.SS1.SSS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> is not forced to exclude models but is also free to accept all models.

We created a dictionary and assigned an integer symbol to each of the most frequent 50000 words and included also three special symbols for unknown words as well as for the start and end of a post. The models used in this scenario consist of two LSTM layers with 200 hidden neurons each and a linear output layer. After the model was trained for 5000 rounds with 100 randomly selected clients in each round, during which each client trained 2 epochs per round, the adversary used 10 malicious clients to inject advertisements and make the model, e.g., predict ”delicious” after ”pasta from astoria tastes”.

These device types represent different kinds of typical IoT devices found in a smart home, such as printers, smart light bulbs, smart plugs, or smart sensors. Depending on the amount of data available for a particular device type, its data were split into at least 15 and up to 200 clients, so that each client had between <span id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p2.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_number">2 000</span> and <span id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p2.3.4" class="ltx_text ltx_number">3 000</span> samples for training. By doing this we ensure that the
training data divided to different clients are as independent as
possible and thereby resemble a real-world setting.

However, <span id="S6.SS3.SSS3.p1.5.2" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> was always able to classify the submitted models as benign or poisoned without any misclassifications.

The reason for not recognizing some models for the PDRs of 8 % and 10 % is that the clustering put them together with benign models, but also the Threshold Exceedings based identifier did not recognize them correctly. For a PDR of 5 %, both, the clustering and the Threshold Exceedings based identifier failed. However, as we have demonstrated in §<a href="#S6.SS3.SSS2" title="VI-C2 Evaluation of Individual Components ‣ VI-C Experimental Results ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-C</span>2</span></a>, the clipping defense layer compensates the vulnerability of the filtering layer from <span id="S6.SS3.SSS3.p1.5.8" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> against such weak attacks. Because of the combination of both layers, the attack failed for all PDRs and the BA was always 0 %.

However, the BA of the local model did not increase, because it is significantly harder to train a model for a specific task without changing the output layer.

<div id="S8.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S8.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many backdoor defenses follow an outlier-detection-based strategy and exclude anomalous mode updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. They assume that the local data of all benign clients are similar, i.e., identically and independently distributed (IID), so that it is sufficient to filter models that differ from the majority of models.
However, in many scenarios the data are non-IID <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, resulting in differences among benign models. Therefore, many benign models are excluded, causing the resulting model to perform worse on the data of the excluded local models (cf. §<a href="#S6.SS4" title="VI-D Impact on Benign Training Process ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-D</span></span></a>).
<br class="ltx_break">Krum aggregates local models by choosing a single local model as the aggregated model with the smallest Euclidean distance to a certain fraction of other models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Hence, models trained on deviating data will never be chosen.
<br class="ltx_break">Munoz <em id="S8.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> exclude a local model if its cosine distance to the aggregated model is higher or lower than the median distance plus/minus the standard derivation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, also this approach suffers from a high false-positive rate (cf. §<a href="#S6.SS3.SSS1" title="VI-C1 Preventing Backdoor Attack ‣ VI-C Experimental Results ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-C</span>1</span></a>).
<br class="ltx_break">Baffle sends the aggregated model to a randomly selected subset of clients. Those so-called validation clients evaluate the model on their local data and vote about accepting the aggregated model or rejecting it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, validation clients can only notice the backdoor if they have a sufficient number of trigger samples or the backdoor attack has a significant impact on the model’s behavior on the main task. The first scenario is not realistic, as benign clients can not be assumed to have knowledge of trigger samples. The second scenario implies that the attack is not stealthy, violating O2 (cf. §<a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Adversary Model ‣ III System and Problem Setting ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a>), and making the backdoor easy to detect. Furthermore, the approach does not work if the data of a (small) number of training clients differs from the majority of validation clients, which happens, e.g., in non-IID scenarios. Also, Baffle cannot be used from the beginning but, e.g., only after several hundreds of rounds, as otherwise many false positives will occur (cf. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>).
<br class="ltx_break">Auror first determines indicative features by clustering for each parameter all local models separately using k-means with two clusters. It selects features with the highest distances between the two centroids.

<p id="S8.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FoolsGold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> assumes that benign datasets from different clients differ from each other and assigns low weights to models, which are similar to many other models. However, this harms the impact of benign clients with similar data. For example, in the case of the NIDS scenario, the network traffic does not vary much because of the limited functionalities of an IoT device. Moreover, FoolsGold sums up the updates for all rounds and compares them, instead of focusing on the current round. This allows a sophisticated adversary to submit poisoned updates without being perceived as suspicious.
<br class="ltx_break">Differential Privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> enforces a maximal, static <span id="S8.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">L<sub id="S8.SS2.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub>-norm</span> of the updates and adds randomly generated noise. As pointed out by Bagdasaryan <em id="S8.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> it has the side effect of also mitigating backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, it fails for well-trained poisoned models (cf. §<a href="#S6" title="VI Evaluation ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>).
<br class="ltx_break">Other approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> calculate the median for all parameters and, therefore, also focus on models, representing the majority but neglect models that were trained on different training data. Moreover, also these defenses have shown to be vulnerable to different poisoning attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break">The approach of Cao <em id="S8.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> trains multiple models. For each of these models, a random subset of clients is used for training a model over multiple rounds. At inference time, each resulting global model is applied and the final prediction is determined via majority voting. Cao <em id="S8.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> prove that if the training is completed, they could determine for a specific sample a minimal number m of malicious clients, which their algorithm would have been able to tolerate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, this number can differ arbitrarily for different input samples. Moreover, their proof does not provide any work in practice. Since determining this number requires a-posteriori knowledge, the impact of determining m at this point is negligible, as the models are already trained and it is, therefore, too late to prevent backdoor attacks. Furthermore, at this point, it is not even clear, whether the current label for the considered samples is even correct or a backdoor attack already took place and flipped the label already. Finally, the approach is vulnerable for the replacement-scaling attack of Bagdasaryan <em id="S8.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and damages the MA, as we demonstrated in §<a href="#S6.SS3.SSS1" title="VI-C1 Preventing Backdoor Attack ‣ VI-C Experimental Results ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-C</span>1</span></a>, and fails even for low PMRs of 5 % (cf. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>).</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Backdoor attacks threaten the integrity of Federated Learning (FL), which is a promising emerging technology.
We show that existing countermeasures cannot adequately address sophisticated backdoor attacks on FL and introduce <span id="S9.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span>, a novel model filtering approach that effectively mitigates backdoor attacks on FL. While existing backdoor defenses are often restricted to excluding abnormal models, <span id="S9.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> follows an orthogonal approach by using several novel techniques to conduct a deep inspection of the submitted models separately for identifying and excluding poisoned models.
<br class="ltx_break">We present several new techniques (<span id="S9.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text">DDifs</span>, <span id="S9.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text">NEUPs</span>, <span id="S9.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text">Threshold</span> Exceedings) to infer information about a model’s training data, identify similar models, and measure the homogeneity of model updates. By performing a deep inspection of the models’ structure and their predictions, <span id="S9.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> can effectively mitigate state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and is robust against sophisticated attacks, without degrading the performance of the aggregated model.
<br class="ltx_break">Recently, different secure aggregation schemes have been proposed preventing the aggregation server from accessing the individual model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

As the table shows, <span id="A0.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> successfully mitigates all backdoor attacks, although it does not always filter all poisoned models. For example, in case of the Ednet Gateway, the filtering does not filter any malicious client, since the Threshold Exceedings of most poisoned models (on average 27.75) are slightly higher than the boundary (29, the benign models have in average 57 Threshold Exceedings). However, as the clipping boundary is always in the interval of benign values and the benign and poisoned models are separated, the BA is still 0%, showing the effectiveness of our multi-layer approach.</p>

We used 200 clients with a PMR of 40% and split all malicious clients into different groups, with a gradually increasing PDR from 5% to 20%. However, although 19 models with a very low PDR were accepted, the majority of poisoned models were rejected but not a single benign model. The BA was 0% and the MA 100%. This also shows the advantage of the ensemble, as a naive clustering approach, using only the cosines and k-means, fails and does not filter any poisoned model, while <span id="A0.SS7.p1.4.9" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> identifies most of the poisoned models and successfully mitigates the impact of the no recognized models.</p>

<br class="ltx_break">As the table shows, the cosine and <span id="A0.SS11.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text">DDif</span> clustering are weakened in some corner cases, e.g., if the learning rate is too low or the anomaly evasion loss function uses the <span id="A0.SS11.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text">DDifs</span>.

<br class="ltx_break">It should be noted, that for the NLP scenario, the outlier-detection defense that uses <span id="A0.SS11.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text">DDifs</span> is completely circumvented. This is caused by the highly non-IID nature of this scenario, s.t. the benign models differ significantly, while the poisoned models are very similar to each other. Therefore, the clustering considers them as the majority and all other (benign) models as outliers. This demonstrates the advantage of using clustering only for identifying similar model updates, as it is done in <span id="A0.SS11.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span>, and the negative impact of using clustering-based techniques as a classifier.</p>

<p id="A0.SS12.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Liu <em id="A0.SS12.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> propose an orthogonal approach for centralized learning that aims to detect trojaned Neural Networks (NN), where the backdoor is activated by a trigger patch in the image. They assume that the poisoned dataset consists of benign images and the adversary <math id="A0.SS12.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{A}" display="inline"><semantics id="A0.SS12.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="A0.SS12.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="A0.SS12.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒜</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A0.SS12.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="A0.SS12.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A0.SS12.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝒜</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A0.SS12.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{A}</annotation></semantics></math> puts a colored patch on those images to create triggered versions of them, s.t. the dataset contains the same image multiple times, without trigger and correct label and with trigger and backdoor target as label. They assume that this causes a neuron in the later layers to being trained to determine the presence of the trigger and, if activated, overrules all other neurons in the same layer. They use benign input data to determine a valid output state for the second last layer, consisting of the activation status for each neuron. Their approach then changes the activation status of each neuron while observing the probabilities that the NN predicts. A model is considered as trojaned if a single neuron changes the output of the NN significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, even if this approach works for patch triggers, for semantic backdoors the trigger can consist of the whole input, s.t. their basic assumption does not hold. <span id="A0.SS12.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text">DeepSight</span> considers also semantic backdoors, where the trigger is, e.g., the color of the car for image datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> or in case of the NIDS scenario the whole packet sequence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Therefore, those backdoors are not activated by a small fraction of the input features but depend on the whole input, preventing that the dataset can contain a sample multiple times and making it less likely that a single neuron is responsible for activating the backdoor. Moreover, it is not possible to classify behavior statically as malicious as this depends on the behavior of the benign clients. Finally, the assumption that the server has validation data is not practical (cf. §<a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Objectives of a Poisoning Defense ‣ III System and Problem Setting ‣ DeepSight: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning Through Deep Model Inspection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>).</p>
