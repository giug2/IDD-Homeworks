<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a fundamental learning paradigm to harness massive data scattered at geo-distributed edge devices in a privacy-preserving way. Given the heterogeneous deployment of edge devices, however, their data are usually Non-IID, introducing significant challenges to FL including degraded training accuracy, intensive communication costs, and high computing complexity. Towards that, traditional approaches typically utilize adaptive mechanisms, which may suffer from scalability issues, increased computational overhead, and limited adaptability to diverse edge environments. To address that, this paper instead leverages the observation that the computation offloading involves inherent functionalities such as node matching and service correlation to achieve data reshaping and proposes <span id="id10.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="id10.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">l</span>earning based <span id="id10.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">o</span>n <span id="id10.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">c</span>omputing <span id="id10.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Off</span>loading (FlocOff) framework, to address data heterogeneity and resource-constrained challenges. Specifically, FlocOff formulates the FL process with Non-IID data in edge scenarios and derives rigorous analysis on the impact of imbalanced data distribution. Based on this, FlocOff decouples the optimization in two steps, namely : (1) Minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence via Computation Offloading scheduling (MKL-CO); (2) Minimizes the Communication Cost through Resource Allocation (MCC-RA). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FlocOff effectively improves model convergence and accuracy by 14.3%-32.7% while reducing data heterogeneity under various data distributions.</p>

Considering factors such as privacy and communication costs, data processing across numerous and dispersed devices has emerged as a future trend. With the proliferation of artificial intelligence applications, the demand for model training using distributed data has significantly increased <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Among them, Federated Learning (FL) has become a feasible learning paradigm<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Federated learning enables local model training on edge data sets. Subsequently, under the centralized control of the cloud parameter server, parameter aggregation and model delivery take place <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. This approach, which uploads parameters rather than original data, mitigates the risk of private data leakage and breaks data silos <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Presently, FL has found application in several business scenarios, including smart healthcare, video detection, and virtual reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

Heterogeneous data may accumulate at the device layer close to the user. In particular, from the perspective of data distribution, this can result in significant data imbalance across clients, leading to the issue of data heterogeneity. More preciously, data heterogeneity can be: (1) differences in the number of samples across clients, and (2) differences in the sample categories owned by each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

A greater variation in color intensity indicates stronger data heterogeneity (in device layer), while uniform color intensity suggests higher data quality (in edge layer). For example, in intelligent industrial monitoring applications, numerous user devices storing Non-IID data (represented by cylinders of different colors) are distributed at the lowest level, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FlocOff: Data Heterogeneity Resilient Federated Learning with Communication-Efficient Edge Offloading Manuscript received November 30, 2023; revised March 23, 2024; accepted 21 May 2024.

If each participant in FL holds data samples from only a few classes, it can lead to the aggregated model not converging at all <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Additionally, discrepancies between local and global data distributions result in significant differences between the aggregated local and global model parameters. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced with an increase in local iteration round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. One example is the slightly inferior performance of the FedAvg algorithm compared to centralized training. Moreover, according to Zhu, H. et al.’s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> investigation, FedAvg is highly sensitive to data distributions. In cases involving deep networks, convergence might not be achieved on severely Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address data heterogeneity for FL, existing researchers have explored in several directions. Adaptive algorithms are one approach to addressing this issue. It autonomously adapts to heterogeneous data distributions, thereby enhancing the model’s generalization capabilities. For instance, Zhang, J. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> adjusts participant subsets and automatically controls hyperparameters to mitigate the negative impact of disparate data. However, these adaptive algorithms necessitate additional computational resources and time for the model’s adaptive adjustments, increasing the training costs. Furthermore, due to the existence of heterogeneous data, the model’s adaptive adjustments might lead to overfitting issues, reducing its generalization on new data. As an alternative option, weight divergence serves as another solution, aiming to enhance model stability by computing appropriate aggregation parameters based on data distribution characteristics. Wu, H. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> dynamically adjusted contributions from each participant by assigning distinct weights to individual nodes. However, this weight divergence approach relies on accurately identifying and understanding data distribution characteristics. Inaccurate or incomplete comprehension of data distribution could potentially misguide parameter settings and result in erroneous aggregation outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Alternatively, we draw the following two observations from real-world FL deployment toward addressing data heterogeneity. First, in many FL use cases, edge devices within a dedicated domain can mutually share their data to eliminate data heterogeneity without violating privacy constraints. This can be relevant for many cross-silo FL applications, where a group of edge devices within a silo is usually managed by the same user or organization, e.g., a smart factory or a clinical hospital, and their data and computing resources can be effectively shared within a privacy-admitted scope <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Second, computation offloading can be leveraged to enable heterogeneous data mixture among a group of trusted, cooperative edge devices, and thus can enhance the data resilience of FL. Besides, by offloading workload across facilities, the resource shortage of individual edge devices can be alleviated and thereupon accelerate the client-side training in FL.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the above viewpoints, in this paper, we make a rigorous theoretical exploration of FL’s data heterogeneity and propose the <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">l</span>earning based <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">o</span>n <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">c</span>omputing <span id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Off</span>loading (FlocOff) framework, which is an efficient FL system that integrates computation offloading for data heterogeneity resilience. Firstly, we investigate the impact of data distribution on the training efficiency of federated learning. It is proved that data heterogeneity is one of the factors affecting model convergence. Secondly, we formulate the data heterogeneity resilience optimization for FL and design the FlocOff framework, which proposes a two-fold approach: (1) Reshaping the Edge Dataset via Computation Offloading (<span id="S1.p5.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RED-CO</span>), and (2) Communication Cost Optimization in Edge Environments (<span id="S1.p5.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CCO-EE</span>). Specifically, for <span id="S1.p5.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RED-CO</span>, FlocOff employs computation offloading as a mapping algorithm to adjust the offloaded data and expand the data of minority classes in the local dataset. For <span id="S1.p5.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CCO-EE</span>, this paper obtains the optimal communication power allocation strategy through efficient numerical methods to efficiently utilize resources in the network. Finally, FlocOff is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that the reshaped dataset reduces data heterogeneity and significantly improves the accuracy of the federated learning model.

<p id="S2.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Upon conducting preliminary experiments, we have uncovered a set of noteworthy characteristics pertaining to the training of federated learning models: (1) The quality of model training is intimately linked to the distribution of data. Specifically, Non-IID data distributions such as those marked by an uneven allocation of samples across classes can significantly compromise the accuracy of federated learning algorithms. (2) We have noted that the rate of convergence in the model training process is inversely proportional to the degree of Non-IID in the dataset. In the federated learning framework, Non-IID data will increase the number of training rounds and parameter aggregation times, increasing system communication costs. Leveraging these insights, in this paper we conduct a retrospective examination of the impact of data heterogeneity on federated learning. We subsequently propose the adoption of computation offloading to revamp private samples and enhance dataset quality. Finally, we revisit the issue of communication efficiency in the federated learning framework with the aim of streamlining system costs whilst concurrently optimizing model accuracy.</p>

</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the perspective of edge computing and communication, machine learning focuses on optimizing models and knowledge itself. Methods to enhance the efficiency of federated learning involve various aspects. Firstly, distributed model aggregation concentrates on merging local model updates from different participants to achieve a higher quality global model. Interpretability stands as another critical area that aims to make model decisions more interpretable and trustworthy, thus enhancing the transparency and controllability of federated learning systems. Additionally, cross-domain knowledge fusion is an important direction in leveraging information from different domains to enhance the generalization ability and learning efficiency of federated learning models. These methods focus on optimizing the way model updates occur and aim to elevate the performance and efficiency of federated learning through more efficient information and model integration.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">From the edge computing perspective, enhancing the efficiency of federated learning involves several key domains. Firstly, Security and Privacy demands safeguarding participants’ privacy during data transmission to prevent data leakage or malicious attacks. For instance, Ma, Z. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduced the ShieldFL framework, employing dual Trapdoor homomorphic encryption to address poisoning in PPFL’s encrypted models. Secondly, Network Heterogeneity acknowledges that federated learning participants may use varied network connections, necessitating effective model update transmission across diverse network environments. This may require designing new communication protocols and optimization algorithms adaptable to diverse network conditions. Liao, Y. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> utilized the FedHP framework to optimize local updating frequencies and network topology in decentralized federated learning, addressing heterogeneity for quicker convergence and improved accuracy. Another critical area is Data Heterogeneity, where different participants in federated learning may possess disparate types and qualities of data. Addressing how to effectively train and update models in the presence of significant data differences is essential. Finally, Communication Efficiency focuses on reducing communication latency, improving data transmission speed, and efficacy. This might involve compressing model updates, reducing data transmission volume, or optimizing network scheduling strategies. Wang, Z. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> optimized the AirComp and multi-cell FL framework to mitigate inter-cell interference, enhancing learning performance in wireless networks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Data heterogeneity stands as a significant factor impacting the efficiency of federated learning. It denotes the differences among various data sources on devices, encompassing uneven data distribution, inconsistent feature distributions, and more. To mitigate the adverse effects of data heterogeneity on federated learning efficiency, researchers have proposed several methodologies. One such approach involves meta-learning and adaptive algorithms. These techniques employ meta-learning to automatically adapt to data heterogeneity, thereby enhancing the model’s generalization capability and performance. A recent investigation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> employs meta-learning and consistency constraints, allowing servers to exchange parallel model information to eliminate data heterogeneity. Yang, L. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> introduced a framework named G-FML, utilizing adaptive grouping of clients and leveraging meta-learning within groups to achieve personalized models, effectively addressing highly heterogeneous environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another solution involves weight divergence, which aims to influence the aggregation of parameters based on data distribution characteristics, thereby enhancing the convergence and stability of the model. Naas, S.-A. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a merging algorithm utilizing weight transfer values quantifying device contributions and implemented a client selection mechanism based on a Bayesian model. Liu, T. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> implemented an optimization method based on class-difficulty based weights, addressing the stability and convergence issues of Non-IID data in federated learning. Additionally, personalized models serve as another approach to tackling data heterogeneity. This method tailors individualized models for each device or data source, considering data heterogeneity extensively, and enabling the model to adapt better to the characteristics of each data source. Tan, Y. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed the FedStar framework using structural embedding and independent structure encoders for federated graph learning, aiming to extract shared structural knowledge in non-uniformly distributed cross-dataset and cross-domain graph data. Qin, Z. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> combined mutual and ensemble learning, addressing non-IID data without prior knowledge, achieving high accuracy on diverse data distributions in cross-silo federated learning.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our methodology introduces an approach to addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning environments, focusing on optimizing data distribution via computing offloading, rather than merely adjusting algorithms post-distribution. This strategy aims to reshape edge datasets by strategically deploying computational tasks across devices based on their capabilities and data characteristics. By directly tackling the challenges of data heterogeneity, this method enhances the learning process’s efficacy and efficiency across devices, diverging from traditional methods like client selection or simple data sharing. Notably, through the implementation of algorithms such as the Federated Client Cluster and Latency-Prediction Selection (FCCPS) by Xin, F. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and the utility function modeling based on clients’ data and resources heterogeneity by Zhang, R. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, our approach seeks to reduce the skewness caused by data heterogeneity, optimizing the learning process by ensuring data processing is most representative where it occurs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to existing approaches that mainly focus on algorithmic adjustments to tackle data heterogeneity, such as Morafah, M. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> incorporating a proximal term in local optimization, modifying the model aggregation scheme at the server side, or Miao, J. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> employing federated clustering methods like FedDec for improved model accuracy through hyperparameters similarity, our work prioritizes a data-centric strategy. By integrating computational offloading as a key technique, FlocOff aims to enhance the training efficiency of edge federated learning by proactively optimizing data distribution and processing, thus addressing the root cause of data heterogeneity. Our research, unlike prior works that primarily focus on algorithmic adjustments or selective participation to combat heterogeneity, delves into the fundamental reorganization of data processing.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of communication resource allocation methods, directly allocating resources specifically to address data heterogeneity is not commonly observed. Instead, several studies have addressed this challenge by integrating communication strategies with other methods to manage data heterogeneity indirectly. For instance, Huang, X. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> tackled the reduction of data volume transmitted in federated learning via communication compression, and introduced a method employing stochastic control to manage the heterogeneity of data processing. Others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> have minimized the impact of Non-iid data by optimizing user associations and the uplink channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leveraging wireless resource allocation to reduce learning latency. Contrary to strategies aimed specifically at data heterogeneity, communication resource allocation often addresses scenarios involving device heterogeneity. For example, Cui, Y. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> developed a mixed-integer linear programming strategy optimized for communication resource allocation to mitigate training inefficiencies caused by device heterogeneity and limited communication resources. Furthermore, Ruby, R. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> explored energy-efficient computing and communication resource allocation in a two-tier federated learning network involving complex networks of IoT nodes and aerial platforms.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">However, these methods failed to incorporate the characteristics of data distribution into the mechanism design.

Each ES and CPS possess local and global models, respectively, which enable them to execute model training and model aggregation tasks. The federated learning training procedure involves three stages<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>: (1) Each ES trains their local models using their respective data; (2) Upon completing the local training, the ES uploads the trained model to the CPS, which aggregates all the uploaded models and performs parameter aggregation; (3) Subsequently, CPS disseminates the synthesized model to all service nodes. These steps ensure that all nodes collaborate and contribute to the federated learning process while preserving data privacy and security.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the highly fragmented nature of edge data, the deployment of federated learning based on heterogeneous data may result in multiple rounds of parameter aggregation and reduced accuracy, thereby engendering unnecessary communication and resource wastage in resource-constrained edge scenarios<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. To address this challenge, we propose a two-pronged solution: (1) Analyzing the correlation between data heterogeneity and model training efficiency to identify potential means of reducing the loss function of the model from a data distribution standpoint, and (2) Modeling the communication cost to optimize communication efficiency in resource-constrained environments.</p>

Traditional SVMs or neural networks with linear activation functions and square loss have convex properties. In fact, our proposed algorithm has demonstrated its effectiveness even on non-convex neural networks, as evidenced in the experimental results presented in Section VI. Furthermore, we extend this property to the aggregated model, whereby the following formula holds:</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The primary aim of this paper is to leverage computation offloading to mitigate data heterogeneity, thereby enhancing the convergence and accuracy of federated learning. Transitioning from problem analysis to the primary objective of this paper, it is evident that managing data heterogeneity is a pivotal factor in improving the performance of federated learning. This understanding forms the foundation for the development of an effective algorithmic framework. From the problem analysis, we can derive several key observations that aid in the design of the algorithmic framework:</p>

Consequently, we have uncovered a crucial insight: by employing computation offloading techniques to reduce data heterogeneity, we anticipate an enhancement in the convergence rate and accuracy of federated learning. In essence, the algorithmic framework we propose aims to mitigate the challenges posed by data heterogeneity through computation offloading and subsequently optimize the effectiveness of federated learning.</p>

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of <span id="S4.SS3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P0</span>, which is a challenging non-convex problem, solving it as a whole poses significant difficulties.

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we perform a series of experiments to assess the impact of the proposed framework on data distribution and federated learning performance. The communication environment is modeled as a multi-cell system where users’ geographic locations are generated randomly, and servers are located at the center of gravity of hexagonal cells. The communication power of each server is set to 0.5-1.0W. Unless specified otherwise, we consider 10 servers and 1000 users. Each server serves 100 users, and users are sliced based on their location, ensuring that they are only sent to servers in their service area.

The <span id="S6.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MNIST dataset</span> comprises a total of 70,000 images, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each grayscale image in the dataset is a 28 by 28-pixel matrix of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. The dataset provides labels for 10 classes, which makes it suitable for supervised learning classification tasks. On the other hand, the <span id="S6.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CIFAR-10 dataset</span> is a smaller dataset, consisting of 10 classes of RGB color images. Each sample in the dataset has three channels and a size of 32 by 32. The images contain common objects such as birds, cats, airplanes, cars, and deer, among others. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Compared to the MNIST dataset, the CIFAR-10 dataset contains real-world objects that exhibit greater diversity and noise, making it more challenging for recognition.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">In terms of model implementation, we initially implemented a deep neural network model featuring two hidden layers, each with 200 neurons activated by the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. We implemented the ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>. The ResNet-18 model is a deep convolutional neural network comprising 18 layers, which incorporates residual blocks each containing two 3x3 convolutional layers and employs a ”skip connection” mechanism. To simulate Non-IID distribution, we had to allocate data distribution on the client-side. In this regard, we referred to the dataset generation method in literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> to slice and group experimental samples. Firstly, in real-world scenarios, classes often appear in pairs. To replicate this phenomenon, we grouped samples from two classes into one group for both the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, each of which consists of 10 classes divided into 5 groups. Secondly, in certain scenarios, samples from some classes may appear more frequently than others. To account for this, we split the samples and assigned one random group as the high probability occurrence group. The remaining four groups were considered as low probability occurrence groups with samples generated with varying distributions. This approach offers flexibility in generating sample distributions that can be tailored to realistic scenarios. The extent of Non-IID data is adjusted by altering the parameters of the generated distribution. By default, unless set otherwise by subsequent experiments, each user’s private data is characterized by the following distribution: two classes were randomly designated as high probability classes, following a Gaussian distribution of X<math id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>N(50,20), while the remaining eight classes were categorized as low-probability classes and followed a Gaussian distribution of X<math id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>N(10,2).</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From an integrated perspective, enhancing the overall efficiency and Quality of Service (QoS) in federated learning is a significant task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>. The QoS is a comprehensive indicator incorporating multiple key factors. In federated learning, we typically decompose QoS into two components: training accuracy and communication costs. Training accuracy directly determines the quality of the model, serving as a crucial criterion for measuring QoS. Meanwhile, communication costs are pivotal in influencing the overall efficiency of federated learning. In a distributed federated learning system, nodes need to exchange and share data through the network. If communication costs are excessively high, they can significantly impede the overall learning efficiency.</p>

As the offloading strategies are implemented, the loss trends of all four curves exhibit a decline. Notably, FlocOff achieves the fastest convergence and lowest loss across various threshold settings, significantly outperforming the other three baseline algorithms. Scaffold demonstrates strong adaptability to Non-IID data, closely approximating the performance of the blue curve. However, IOJR and FedAvg, lacking mechanisms to counteract data heterogeneity, exhibit the slowest convergence rates and higher losses upon model stabilization. Moreover, it is important to note that the similar trends across the curves suggest that different threshold settings have a limited impact on the performance of FlocOff.</p>

The x-axis represents the number of rounds, while the y-axis charts the changes in loss. A prominent feature across all three graphs is the consistent positioning of the blue curve below the orange, red, and green curves. This indicates that the FlocOff algorithm outperforms the three baseline algorithms across different initial data distributions. The performances of IOJR and FedAvg are closely matched, whereas Scaffold achieves a lower loss. By comparing the results, we can identify the differences caused by different initial data distributions. Notably, the initial data based on IID exhibits the smallest KL divergence, hovering around 0.15, which is significantly lower than that for the blank and Non-IID settings. Furthermore, the consistent downward trend of the blue curve across all three graphs suggests that varying initial data distributions have a minimal impact on the performance of FlocOff.</p>

<p id="S6.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Subsequently, we applied the federated learning approach to assess its performance on two Non-IID datasets. Additionally, we established an IID environment as a baseline to compare with FlocOff performance in Non-IID conditions. In the IID scenario, each edge dataset is independently and identically distributed. This represents an ideal condition, eliminating the need for offloading algorithms to adjust data distribution. The homogeneity of data in IID environments facilitates optimal model convergence and accuracy. This scenario serves as a perfect baseline to underscore the effectiveness of FlocOff. Through this approach, we aim to demonstrate the FlocOff capability to counteract the adverse impacts of data heterogeneity on model training in Non-IID conditions.</p>

The horizontal axis corresponds to the model accuracy, while the vertical axis represents the communication cost. The blue solid line in the figure represents the performance of FlocOff in HCP, while the red solid line represents the performance of the IOJR in the Non-IID scenario. Correspondingly, the light blue dashed line represents the performance of FlocOff under the LCP scenario, while the light red dashed line depicts the performance of IOJR in the LCP. In the LCP scenario, both algorithms achieve faster convergence with lower energy consumption. This is shown in the figure as the dotted line is above the solid line, achieving higher accuracy with the same communication cost. Notably, the blue line always lies below the red line, indicating that the FlocOff approach achieves better model training under the same communication cost. Specifically, the communication cost associated with the 60% accuracy of the IOJR is roughly 51J, whereas the communication cost associated with FlocOff is a mere 9J, with a drop of 82.4%. This result confirms that the proposed FlocOff framework can significantly alleviate the communication burden.</p>

This further underscores that the FlocOff framework can substantially reduce communication resources in the system and is thus suitable for edge networks with limited resources.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The present paper addresses the challenges of federated learning in edge scenarios, namely the heterogeneity of data and the limited communication resources. In particular, we investigate the impact of data distribution on the efficiency of model convergence and highlight the importance of addressing this issue to enhance training efficiency. To this end, we propose two sub-problems: (1) Reshaping the Edge Dataset via Computation Offloading (<span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RED-CO</span>); and (2) Communication Cost Optimization in Edge Environments (<span id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">CCO-EE</span>). Our proposed FlocOff framework aims to reshape the edge data distribution through offloaded maps. To achieve this, we propose a Minimizes the KL Divergence via Computation Offloading scheduling (<span id="S7.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MKL-CO</span>) algorithm that adapts the offload decisions based on user device sample distributions. Moreover, we develop an efficient Minimizes the Communication Cost through Resource Allocation (<span id="S7.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MCC-RA</span>) algorithm to generate power allocation strategies. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that the FlocOff framework effectively improves the convergence rate and model accuracy of federated learning training while reducing the communication cost of the system.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our paper makes significant contributions to the field of federated learning in edge scenarios by identifying key challenges and proposing an innovative framework that overcomes these obstacles. The proposed approach leverages advanced techniques, such as offloading algorithms and numerical optimization, to optimize offloading and resource allocation, resulting in a more efficient and effective learning process.</p>
