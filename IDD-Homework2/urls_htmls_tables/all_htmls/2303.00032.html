<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">It is anticipated that aerial-terrestrial integrated networks incorporating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mounted relays will offer improved coverage and connectivity in the beyond 5G era. Meanwhile, federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning technique for building inference models over wireless networks due to its ability to maintain user privacy and reduce communication overhead. However, off-the-shelf FL models aggregate global parameters at a central parameter server (CPS), increasing energy consumption and latency, as well as inefficiently utilizing radio resource blocks (RRBs) for distributed user devices (UDs). This paper presents a resource-efficient FL framework, called FedMoD (<span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">fed</span>erated learning with <span id="id3.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">mo</span>del <span id="id3.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">d</span>issemination), for millimeter-wave (mmWave) aerial-terrestrial integrated networks with the following two unique characteristics. Firstly, FedMoD presents a novel decentralized model dissemination algorithm that makes use of UAVs as local model aggregators through UAV-to-UAV and device-to-device (D2D) communications. As a result, FedMoD (i) increases the number of participant UDs in developing FL model and (ii) achieves global model aggregation without involving CPS. Secondly, FedMoD reduces the energy consumption of FL using radio resource management (RRM) under the constraints of over-the-air learning latency. In order to achieve this, by leveraging graph theory, FedMoD optimizes the scheduling of line-of-sight (LOS) UDs to suitable UAVs/RRBs over mmWave links and non-LOS UDs to available LOS UDs via overlay D2D communications. Extensive simulations reveal that decentralized FedMoD offers same convergence rate performance as compared to conventional FL frameworks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to have a significant impact on the economy by 2026 with a projected global market value of US$59.2 billion, making the inclusion of UAVs critical in beyond 5G cellular networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. There are several unique features of UAV-mounted communication platforms, including the high likelihood of establishing line-of-sight connections with ground nodes, rapid deployment, and adjustable mobility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. With such attributes, UAVs can serve as aerial base stations (BSs) or relays in conjunction with terrestrial base stations, resulting in aerial-terrestrial integrated networks (ATINs). By connecting cell-edge user devices (UDs) to terrestrial cellular networks via aerial BSs or relays, ATINs improve coverage and connectivity significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
The 3GPP standard also incorporates the use of UAVs as a communication infrastructure to complement terrestrial cellular networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. During current 5G deployment efforts, it has been shown that the millimeter-wave band at 28 GHz is significantly larger and more capable than the sub-6 GHz band. At the same time, air-to-ground communications have the advantage of avoiding blockages and maintaining LOS connectivity as a result of UAV’s high altitude and flexibility. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the mmWave band is suitable for deploying high-capacity ATINs in the next-generation cellular networks.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A data-driven decision making process enables wireless networks to manage radio resources more efficiently by predicting and analyzing several dynamic factors, such as users’ behavior, mobility patterns, traffic congestion, and quality-of-service expectations. Data-driven radio resource management (RRM) has gained increasing popularity, thanks to the expansion of wireless sensing applications, the availability of enormous data, and the increasing computing capabilities of devices. To train machine learning (ML) models, raw data collected from individual UDs is aggregated in a central parameter server (CPS). As a result, such centralized ML approaches require enormous amounts of network resources to collect raw data from UDs. In addition, centralized ML also impairs users’ privacy since CPS can easily extract sensitive information from raw data gathered from UDs. Recently, Google proposed federated learning (FL) for UDs to collaboratively learn a model without sharing their private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In FL, UDs update parameters according to their local datasets, and only the most recent parameters are shared with the CPS. Using local models from all participating UDs, the CPS updates global model parameters and shares them with the UDs. The local and global models are adjusted iteratively until convergence. Unlike centralized ML approaches, FL not only protects UD privacy but also improves wireless resource utilization significantly. Nevertheless, the convergence performance of FL in wireless networks significantly depends on the appropriate selection of the participating UDs, based on both channel and data quality, and bandwidth allocation among the selected UDs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The FL framework provides a powerful computation tool for ATINs to make decentralized decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. UAVs are frequently used as aerial sensors or aerial data collectors in several practical scenarios, and the convergence and accuracy of FL in such use cases can be improved by appropriately exploiting the unique attributes of air-to-ground communication links. For instance, a FL framework was developed for hazardous zone detection and air quality prediction by utilizing UAVs as local learners and deploying a swarm of them to collect local air quality index (AQI) data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. A UAV-supported FL framework was also proposed in which a drone visited learning sites sequentially, aggregated model parameters locally, and relayed them to the CPS for global aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, ATINs can also deploy UAVs as aerial BSs with edge computing capabilities. In this context, UAV can provide global model aggregation capability for a large numbers of ground UDs, thanks to its large coverage and high probability of establishing LOS communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In the aforesaid works, all the local model parameters were aggregated into a single CPS using the conventional star-based FL framework. Although such a star-based FL is convenient, it poses several challenges in the context of ATINs. Firstly, a star-based FL requires a longer convergence time due to the presence of straggling local learners. Recall, the duration of transmission and hovering of a UAV influences its energy consumption, and consequently, increasing the convergence time of FL directly increases the energy consumption of UAVs. This presents a significant challenge for implementing FL in ATINs since UAVs usually have limited battery capacity. In addition, as a result of increased distance and other channel impairments, a number of local learners with excellent datasets may be out of coverage of the central server in practice. The overall learning accuracy of FL models can be severely impacted if these local learners are excluded from the model. The use of star-based FL frameworks in ATINs is also confronted by the uncertainty of air-to-ground communication links resulting from random blocking and the mobility of UAVs. This work seeks to address these challenges by proposing a resource-efficient FL framework for mmWave ATINs that incorporates decentralized model dissemination and energy-efficient UD scheduling.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the current literature, communication-efficient FL design problems are explored. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors suggested a stochastic alternating direction multiplier method to update the local model parameters while reducing communications between local learners and CPS. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, a joint client scheduling and RRB allocation scheme was developed to minimize accuracy loss. To minimize the loss function of FL training, UD selection, RRB scheduling, and transmit power allocation were optimized simultaneously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Numbers of global iterations and duration of each global iteration were minimized by jointly optimizing the UD selection and RRB allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Besides, since UDs participating in FL are energy-constrained, an increasing number of studies focused on designing energy-efficient FL frameworks. As demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the energy consumption of FL can be reduced by uploading only quantized or compressed model parameters from UDs to CPS. Furthermore, RRM enhances energy efficiency of FL in large-scale networks. Several aspects of RRM, such as client scheduling, RRB allocation, and transmit power control, were extensively studied to minimize both communication and computation energy of FL frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. An energy-efficient FL framework based on relay-assisted two-hop transmission and non-orthogonal multiple access scheme was recently proposed for both energy and resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In the aforesaid studies, conventional star-based FL frameworks were studied. Due to its requirement to aggregate all local model parameters on a single server, the star-based FL is inefficient for energy- and resource-constrained wireless networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical FL (HFL) frameworks involve network edge devices uploading model parameters to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers for local aggregation, and MEC servers uploading aggregated local model parameters to CPS periodically. The HFL framework increases the number of connected UDs and reduces energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. To facilitate the HFL framework, a client-edge-cloud collaboration framework was explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. HFL was investigated in heterogeneous wireless networks through the introduction of fog access points and multiple-layer model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Dynamic wireless channels in the UD-to-MEC and MEC-to-CPS hops and data distribution play a crucial role in FL learning accuracy and convergence. Thus, efficient RRM is imperative for implementation of HFL. As a result, existing literature evaluated several RRM tasks, including UD association, RRB allocation, and edge association, to reduce cost, latency, and learning error of HFL schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While HFL increases the number of participating UDs, its latency and energy consumption are still hindered by dual-hop communication for uploading and broadcasting local and global model parameters. Server-less FL is a promising alternative to reduce latency and energy consumption. This FL framework allows UDs to communicate locally aggregated models without involving central servers, thereby achieving model consensus. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a FL scheme that relies on device-to-device (D2D) communications to achieve model consensus. However, due to the requirement of global model aggregation with two-time scale FL over both D2D and user-to-CPS wireless transmission, this FL scheme has limited latency improvement. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the authors developed FL model dissemination schemes by leveraging connected edge servers (ESs), which aggregate local models from their UD clusters and exchange them with all the other ESs in the network for global aggregation. However, a fully connected ES network is prohibitively expensive in practice, especially when ESs are connected by wireless links. In addition, each global iteration of FL framework takes significantly longer because ESs continue to transmit local aggregated models until all other ESs receive them successfully <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> addressed this issue by introducing conflicting UDs, which are the UDs covering multiple clusters, and allowing parameter exchanges between them and local model aggregators.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In spite of recent advances in resource-efficient, hierarchical, and decentralized FL frameworks, existing studies have several limitations in utilizing UAVs as local model aggregators in mmWave ATINs. In particular, state-of-the-art HFL schemes of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> can prohibitively increase the communication and propulsion energy consumption of UAVs because it involves two-hop communications and increased latency. Additionally, mmWave band requires LOS links between UDs and UAVs for local model aggregation, as well as LOS UAV-to-UAV links for model dissemination. Accordingly, the FL model dissemination frameworks proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> will not be applicable to mmWave ATINs. We emphasize that in order to maintain convergence speed and reduce energy consumption, the interaction among UD-to-UAV associations, RRB scheduling, and UAV-to-UAV link selection, in addition to the inherent properties of mmWave bands, must be appropriately characterized. Such a fact motivates us to develop computationally efficient models dissemination and RRM schemes for mmWave ATINs implementing decentralized FL.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A UAV-based distributed FL model aggregation method is proposed by leveraging UAV-to-UAV communications. Through the proposed method, each UAV is able to collect local model parameters only from the UDs in its coverage area and share those parameters over LOS mmWave links with its neighbor UAVs. The notion of physical layer network coding is primarily used for disseminating model parameters among UAVs. This allows each UAV to collect all of the model parameters as well as aggregate them globally without the involvement of the CPS. With the potential to place UAVs near cell edge UDs, the proposed UAV-based model parameter collection and aggregation significantly increases the number of participating UDs in the FL model construction process. Based on the channel capacity of the UAV-to-UAV links, a conflict graph is formed to facilitate distributed model dissemination among the UAVs and a maximal weighted independent search (MWIS) method is proposed to solve the conflict graph problem. In light of the derived solutions, a decentralized FedMoD is developed and its convergence is rigorously proved.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, a novel RRM scheme is investigated to reduce the overall energy consumption of the developed decentralized FL framework under the constraint of learning latency. The proposed RRM optimizes both (i) the scheduling of LOS UDs to suitable UAVs and radio resource blocks (RRBs) over mmWave links and (ii) the scheduling of non-LOS UDs to LOS UDs over side-link D2D communications such that non-LOS can transmit their model parameters to UAVs with the help of available LOS UDs. As both scheduling problems are provably NP-hard, their optimal solutions require prohibitively complex computational resources. Two graph theory solutions are therefore proposed for the aforementioned scheduling problems to strike a suitable balance between optimality and computational complexity.</p>

Each UAV exchanges its scheduled UAVs with its neighbor UAV. Then the conflict solution phase starts. The UAV that is associated to multiple UAVs (UAV that is located at the overlapped regions of UAVs) is assigned to one UAV that offers the highest weight of scheduling that UAV. UAVs that do not offer the maximum weight cannot schedule that UAV, and therefore remove that UAV from their set of associated UAVs and vertices. We then design the new graph. We repeat this process until all the conflicting UAVs are scheduled to at most a single transmitting UAV.

To minimize the energy consumption at each global iteration, we need to develop a framework that decides: i) the UAV-UD clustering; ii) the adopted transmission rate of the UDs <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{U}_{los}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒰</mi><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">l</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">o</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1a" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.4" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml">s</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝒰</ci><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑙</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑜</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.4">𝑠</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{U}_{los}</annotation></semantics></math> to transmit their local models to the set of UAVs/RRBs; and iii) the set of D2D transmitters (relays) that helping the non-LOS UDs to transmit their local models to the set of UAVs <math id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{K}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝒦</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝒦</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">\mathcal{K}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Particularly, in the considered star-based and HFL schemes, the CPS can receive the local trained models from the UDs, where each scheduled UD transmits its trained model directly to the CPS (in case of star-based FL) or through UAVs (in case of HFL). Thus, the CPS can aggregate all the local models of all the scheduled UDs. In the considered decentralized FedMoD, before the dissemination rounds starts, each UAV has aggregated the trained local models of the scheduled UDs in its cluster only. However, with the novel dissemination FedMoD method, each UAV shares its aggregated models with the neighboring UAVs using one hop transmission. Thus, at each dissemination round, UAVs build their side information (<span id="S6.p3.9.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Known</span> models and <span id="S6.p3.9.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Unknown</span> models) until they receive all the <span id="S6.p3.9.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Unknown</span> models. Thus, the UAVs have full knowledge about the global model of the system at each global iteration. Thanks to the efficient FedMoD dissemination method, the accuracy of the proposed FedMoD scheme is almost the same as the centralized FL schemes. Such efficient communications among UAVs accelerate the learning progress, thereby FedMoD model reaches an accuracy of (<math id="S6.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.945" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S6.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">0.945</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.2.m2.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.2.m2.1.1">0.945</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.2.m2.1c">0.945</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S6.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.668" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S6.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">0.668</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.3.m3.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.3.m3.1.1">0.668</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.3.m3.1c">0.668</annotation></semantics></math> for MNIST and CIFAR-10) with around <math id="S6.p3.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="200" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.4.m4.1a"><mn id="S6.p3.4.m4.1.1" xref="S6.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml">200</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.4.m4.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S6.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.4.m4.1.1">200</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.4.m4.1c">200</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S6.p3.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="300" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.5.m5.1a"><mn id="S6.p3.5.m5.1.1" xref="S6.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml">300</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.5.m5.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S6.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.5.m5.1.1">300</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.5.m5.1c">300</annotation></semantics></math> global iterations, respectively, as compared to the accuracy of (<math id="S6.p3.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.955" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.6.m6.1a"><mn id="S6.p3.6.m6.1.1" xref="S6.p3.6.m6.1.1.cmml">0.955</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.6.m6.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.p3.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.6.m6.1.1">0.955</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.6.m6.1c">0.955</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S6.p3.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.944" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.7.m7.1a"><mn id="S6.p3.7.m7.1.1" xref="S6.p3.7.m7.1.1.cmml">0.944</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.7.m7.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.p3.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.7.m7.1.1">0.944</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.7.m7.1c">0.944</annotation></semantics></math> for MNIST) and (<math id="S6.p3.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.665" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.8.m8.1a"><mn id="S6.p3.8.m8.1.1" xref="S6.p3.8.m8.1.1.cmml">0.665</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.8.m8.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.p3.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.8.m8.1.1">0.665</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.8.m8.1c">0.665</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S6.p3.9.m9.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.668" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.9.m9.1a"><mn id="S6.p3.9.m9.1.1" xref="S6.p3.9.m9.1.1.cmml">0.668</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.9.m9.1b"><cn type="float" id="S6.p3.9.m9.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.9.m9.1.1">0.668</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.9.m9.1c">0.668</annotation></semantics></math> for CIFAR-10) for star-based and HFL schemes, respectively. It is important to note that although our proposed overcomes the struggling UD issue of the star-based scheme and the two-hop transmission of the HFL, it needs a few rounds of model dissemination. However, the effective coding scheme of the models minimizes the number of dissemination rounds. In addition, due to the high communication links between the UAVs, the dissemination delay is negligible which does not affect the FL time.</p>

we see that within a given number of global iterations, a more

From the objective function of problem P1, we can observe that an efficient radio resource management scheme leads to
a lower energy consumption. Hence, from Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Decentralized Model Dissemination Empowered Federated Learning in mmWave Aerial-Terrestrial Integrated Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, we observe that for FedMoD, the average energy consumption
is minimized. Such an observation is because the proposed schemes judiciously allocate LOS UDs to the UAVs and their available RRBs as well as D2D communications. In particular, the random scheme has the largest energy consumption because it randomly schedules the UDs to the UAVs and their available RRBs. Accordingly, from
energy consumption perspective, it is inefficient to consider a random radio resource management scheme. From Fig. <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Decentralized Model Dissemination Empowered Federated Learning in mmWave Aerial-Terrestrial Integrated Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, it is observed that the proposed centralized scheduling FedMoD and distributed FedMoD schemes offer the same energy consumption performances for the same number of UDs. Such an observation can be explained by the following argument. When we have a large number of UDs, the probability that a UD is scheduled to more than one UAV decreases. As a result, the conflict among UAVs and the likelihood of scheduling UDs to the wrong UAV decreases. As an insight from this figure, a distributed radio resource management scheme is a suitable alternative for scheduling the LOS UDs to the UAVs, especially for large-scale networks.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed a novel decentralized FL scheme, called FedMoD, which maintains convergence speed and reduces energy consumption of FL in mmWave ATINs. Specifically, we proposed a FedMoD scheme based on inter-cluster UAV communications, and theoretically proved its convergence. A rate-adaptive and D2D-assisted RRM scheme was also developed to minimize the overall energy consumption of the proposed decentralized FL scheme. The presented simulation results revealed that our proposed FedMoD achieves the same accuracy as the baseline FL scheme while substantially reducing energy consumption for convergence. In addition, simulation results reveal various insights concerning how the topology of the network impacts the number of inter-cluster UAV aggregations required for the convergence of FedMoD.
