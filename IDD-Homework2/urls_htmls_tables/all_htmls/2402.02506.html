<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning approach for Internet of Things (IoT), but it has to address network congestion problems when the population of IoT devices grows. Hierarchical FL (HFL) alleviates this issue by distributing model aggregation to multiple edge servers. Nevertheless, the challenge of communication overhead remains, especially in scenarios where all IoT devices simultaneously join the training process. For scalability, practical HFL schemes select a subset of IoT devices to participate in the training, hence the notion of device scheduling. In this setting, only selected IoT devices are scheduled to participate in the global training, with each of them being assigned to one edge server. Existing HFL assignment methods are primarily based on search mechanisms, which suffer from high latency in finding the optimal assignment. This paper proposes an improved K-Center algorithm for device scheduling and introduces a deep reinforcement learning-based approach for assigning IoT devices to edge servers. Experiments show that scheduling 50% of IoT devices is generally adequate for achieving convergence in HFL with much lower time delay and energy consumption. In cases where reduction in energy consumption (such as in Green AI) and reduction of messages (to avoid burst traffic) are key objectives, scheduling 30% IoT devices allows a substantial reduction in energy and messages with similar model accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The advent of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled connected devices to perform complex tasks empowered by machine learning (ML) techniques. Typically deployed in the forms of Cyber-Physical Systems with sensing and actuating capabilities, the control and operations of such connected devices may be automated by artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine-learned models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. To train these ML models, IoT devices collect the required data and transmit them to a remote server for centralized training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, for applications involving private and confidential sensing data, the transmission of device data raises privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Besides, centralized training will result in serious computation bottlenecks and prohibitive communication overheads, especially when dealing with a massive amount of training data collected from a large number of IoT devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. To surmount these obstacles, Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution for training ML models in a distributed manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. By leveraging FL, IoT devices can train the model with their data not leaving the devices. After local training on the device, model parameters are uploaded for aggregation. Since the training data are retained on the IoT devices, FL mitigates the risk of a privacy breach at the central server. Thanks to these benefits, modern IoT systems have extensively adopted FL in a range of emerging applications such as Smart Healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, Smart Agriculture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and Smart City <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, the scalability of bandwidth resources of a single remote aggregation server remains a non-trivial issue when accommodating a large number of IoT devices in the training process, hence resulting in network congestion. To overcome this challenge, a new FL approach called Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has been introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In HFL, which typically involves multiple edge servers and a cloud server, IoT devices train their models locally and send model parameters to their assigned edge servers for edge aggregation. After multiple edge updates, the edge servers transmit the edge models to the cloud server for global aggregation. If designed and implemented carefully, HFL can achieve a remarkable reduction in energy consumption and much lower time delay in network communications. In cases where reduction in energy consumption (such as in Green AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>) and reduction of messages in each round (so as to avoid burst traffic) are key objectives, HFL is an attractive direction to explore and deserves in-depth investigation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although HFL offers convincing benefits, the deployment of HFL still faces practical challenges. For example, HFL still causes notable communication and computation overheads when all the IoT devices participate in the training process. In addition, the straggler effect will significantly increase the latency of HFL. Specifically, suppose one of the edge servers experiences high latency in finishing its edge aggregation due to a straggler IoT device. In that case, the overall HFL training speed will be negatively affected as the cloud server performs global aggregation only when all edge servers have completed their respective edge aggregations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this case, device scheduling is an effective approach to speed up HFL training. Device scheduling refers to the process of selecting a subset of devices to participate in each global iteration. Device scheduling has the potential to reduce energy consumption for training HFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and decrease the probability of having a straggler IoT device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, non-identically independently distributed (non-IID) datasets pose another challenge in ensuring model accuracy. If not handled properly, the local models trained on the non-IID dataset will become biased towards a certain class, resulting in poorer performance on the other classes. Such biased performance may be propagated to the global model through model aggregation, resulting in slower growth of testing accuracy and requiring more global iterations to converge to a preset target accuracy. Moreover, existing scheduling methods focus on traditional FL and can hardly be expanded into HFL. Therefore, an effective device scheduling algorithm is necessary for HFL to minimize the system cost while warranting learning performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Another issue of HFL is device assignment, which refers to the task of assigning the scheduled IoT devices to the edge servers. Device assignment aims to balance the workload across edge servers and ensure that each edge server is not overwhelmed with too many IoT devices to handle. To address this issue, an iterative searching algorithm called HFEL has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which can approximate solutions to the device assignment problem. However, HFEL needs a long running time due to its search mechanism. Furthermore, if device scheduling is adopted in HFL, HFEL will be executed at each global iteration, thus leading to higher latency. Thus, there is a need to develop a device assignment algorithm that can efficiently assign IoT devices to edge servers while requiring less computation time than the HFEL algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose an HFL framework to solve the two challenges above. Specifically, we design an improved K-Center (IKC) algorithm to perform device scheduling, which enables HFL to converge swiftly on <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text">non-IID</span> datasets. In addition, we employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to tackle the device assignment problem.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has attracted great attention from researchers because of its potential to address privacy concerns and improve the scalability of distributed machine learning (ML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To further enhance the efficiency of Federated Learning, a variety of resource allocation schemes are proposed to minimize FL’s training time or energy consumption, or both <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In HFL, each edge server can apply these resource allocation methods individually. Therefore, resource allocation in HFL is not the core of our work. In the realm of device scheduling for FL, several studies have proposed various strategies. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> introduced a strategy that combines device scheduling and resource allocation to maximize model accuracy within latency-constrained wireless FL settings. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposes a device scheduling algorithm that takes into account both channel conditions and the importance of local model updates. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> designs a scheduling policy aimed at striking a balance between channel quality and update significance. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> introduces FedAvg for FL, which randomly schedules a subset of IoT devices during each iteration. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> utilizes deep reinforcement learning to minimize overall system costs through device scheduling. At each global iteration, however, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> require to collect model parameters or loss gradients from all IoT devices to the cloud for making scheduling decisions. In HFL, the cloud server only receives the parameters of the edge models at each global iteration and has no access to the parameters or the gradients of the local models. Therefore, these works are no longer effective in HFL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> presents a framework that combines device scheduling and resource allocation to enhance the long-term performance of FL. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposes a design that integrates resource allocation and scheduling to improve the convergence rate of FL, all while adhering to energy and latency constraints. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> devises strategies for energy-efficient bandwidth allocation and scheduling, aiming to minimize total energy consumption without compromising learning performance. However, the bandwidth constraints considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> are intended for scenarios involving a single central server.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In HFL, <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">non-IID</span> datasets usually refer to datasets that have highly skewed class distribution. For example, most of the data belong to a majority class, while the remaining data belong to other classes. The local model trained on the <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text">non-IID</span> dataset achieves good performance in identifying its majority class while often failing to correctly predict the other classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Such performance bias of the local model can be transferred to the global model through edge aggregation and cloud aggregation.

A recent study proposes an iterative algorithm called HFEL to deal with problem (<a href="#S5.E17" title="In V-A Preliminaries ‣ V Fast Device Assignment via Deep Reinforcement Learning ‣ Device Scheduling and Assignment in Hierarchical Federated Learning for Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>). Firstly, HFEL performs device transferring adjustment, which means transferring a device from its original edge server to another server. Secondly, HFEL carries out device exchanging adjustments, which will exchange two devices between their respective edge servers. HFEL will perform resource allocation algorithms for each edge server and obtain the objective value (<a href="#S5.E17" title="In V-A Preliminaries ‣ V Fast Device Assignment via Deep Reinforcement Learning ‣ Device Scheduling and Assignment in Hierarchical Federated Learning for Internet of Things" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>) before and after each adjustment.

However, due to the large search space, HFEL incurs high assigning latency in reaching convergence. Moreover, HFEL assumes that all the devices are involved at each global iteration, in which case device assignment only needs to be carried out once. In this work, however, the devices that participate in training HFL vary at each global iteration due to device scheduling, thus necessitating device assignment at each global iteration. Therefore, HFEL will incur even higher assigning latency.</p>

We compare the results of IKC with two benchmark models, FedAvg and VKC.

Besides, scheduling more devices leads to a more stable and robust training process as the HFL model can acquire more knowledge from the devices, thereby improving the generalization capability of the model. More importantly, we see that the learning curves as well as the shaded areas of IKC are situated above those of VKC and FedAvg, which demonstrates that our method outperforms the two benchmarks in terms of accelerating the convergence of HFL.

The y-axis of the figure displays the average accumulated reward over 50 episodes. As shown in the plot, the reward progressively increases from the beginning of the training process and eventually stabilizes around 17 when the algorithm converges. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed DRL algorithm can acquire the ability to make assignment decisions comparable to the HFEL strategy.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied the mechanism of HFL and investigated device scheduling and assignment in HFL. We formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the weights sum of the time delay and energy consumption for training the entire HFL in the IoT system. We propose a novel HFL framework to solve this problem effectively. The proposed framework employs the improved K-center (IKC) algorithm for device scheduling and the dueling double deep Q-Network (D<sup id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">3</sup>QN) for device assignment. We compare the proposed methods with several baselines and evaluate the proposed HFL framework on FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10. The experimental results show that the proposed IKC algorithm enables HFL to achieve the target accuracy within fewer global iterations, while the DRL method can conduct fast device assignment and allows HFL to obtain low time delay and energy consumption. The whole HFL framework effectively reduces the time delay and energy consumption required for training the entire HFL algorithm when compared with traditional HFL. Additionally, scheduling 50% of the IoT devices is generally sufficient to achieve convergence in HFL while decreasing the time delay and energy consumption. If reducing energy consumption and the size of transmitted messages in each round is a primary concern, it is recommended to schedule only 30% of the devices.</p>
