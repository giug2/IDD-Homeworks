<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">A novel form of inference attack in vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed, where two parties collaborate in training a machine learning (ML) model. Logistic regression is considered for the VFL model. One party, referred to as the active party, possesses the ground truth labels of the samples in the training phase, while the other, referred to as the passive party, only shares a separate set of features corresponding to these samples.
It is shown that the active party can carry out inference attacks on both training and prediction phase samples by acquiring an ML model independently trained on the training samples available to them.
This type of inference attack does not require the active party to be aware of the score of a specific sample, hence it is referred to as an agnostic inference attack.
It is shown that utilizing the observed confidence scores during the prediction phase, before the time of the attack, can improve the performance of the active party’s autonomous model, and thus improve the quality of the agnostic inference attack.
As a countermeasure, privacy-preserving schemes (PPSs) are proposed.
While the proposed schemes preserve the utility of the VFL model, they systematically distort the VFL parameters corresponding to the passive party’s features.
The level of the distortion imposed on the passive party’s parameters is adjustable, giving rise to a trade-off between privacy of the passive party and interpretabiliy of the VFL outcomes by the active party.
The distortion level of the passive party’s parameters could be chosen carefully according to the privacy and interpretabiliy concerns of the passive and active parties, respectively, with the hope of keeping both parties (partially) satisfied.
Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack and the PPSs.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence of distributed machine learning (ML) techniques has been a game-changer in the way valuable information is obtained from raw data in various fields, such as computer vision, image recognition, financial services, and natural language processing. With the growing need for the utilization of distributed data to construct more accurate and advanced ML models, there has been a surge in demand in multiple sectors. To address the limitations of centralized ML models, including issues with data storage, excessive computations, security and privacy breaches, various distributed ML techniques have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. One such technique is federated learning (FL), which was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In FL, two or more data-centers, known as parties, work together to train a shared ML model, thereby addressing the concerns of traditional centralized learning. This approach has gained widespread attention for its applications in real-life scenarios, such as in health systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, keyboard prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and e-commerce <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Three types of Federated Learning (FL) are commonly studied in the literature, including Horizontal FL (HFL), Vertical FL (VFL), and Transfer FL. The distinction between these approaches lies in the manner in which data is partitioned and shared among parties. In HFL, each party holds a unique set of samples, but all parties share the same features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, VFL involves parties sharing the same samples, but each party trains and predicts collaboratively using a separate set of features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, an illustration of VFL is presented, where a bank and a FinTech company collaborate in training a classifier that will be used by the bank to approve or reject credit card applications. The bank, as the active party, holds the ground truth labels for the samples in the training set. Meanwhile, the FinTech company, as the passive party, contributes to the VFL process by sharing a distinct set of features pertaining to the samples.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After the VFL model is trained, both the bank and the FinTech company use it collaboratively to make predictions for new samples. To do this, each party inputs their corresponding features for each sample into the model. Typically, a third party known as the coordinator authority (CA) is involved in this collaboration during both the training and prediction phases. The CA’s role during the prediction phase is to obtain the model’s outcome for new samples and share it with the active party when requested. The model output can be in the form of a confidence score, which is a probability vector representing the likelihood of each class, or a one-hot vector representing the output class label. Due to privacy concerns, the confidence score of a sample may be distorted before it is delivered to the active party, typically by providing a noisy or rounded version of the score. In the literature generally two scenarios are considered for this type of collaboration, namely white box and black box settings, where the active party is aware and unaware of the passive party’s parameters, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Focusing on the prediction phase, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, it has been demonstrated that when the exact form of the confidence scores are shared with the active party, there is a risk of the adversary (i.e. the active party) reconstructing the features of the passive party, which are considered private information. This can result in a privacy leak for the users, and therefore known as inference attack. The reconstruction is accurate when the number of unknown features, or the passive party features, is less than the number of classes. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> various approaches regarding improved inference attacks have been proposed that are based on solving an under-determined system of linear equations. In particular, it is shown that using methods that approximate the best worst case solution among feasible solutions can significantly improve the attack accuracy. Furthermore, as a defense mechanism, it has been shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> that by transforming the passive features<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>For brevity, throughout the paper we use passive (active) features and passive (active) parameters instead of passive (active) party’s features and passive (active) party’s parameters, respectively.</span></span></span> in a linear fashion and keeping the transformation mapping hidden from the active party, it is possible to preserve the model’s accuracy while reducing the privacy leakage, (i.e., higher mean squared error in reconstructing the passive features).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While previous works have studied inference attacks in the prediction phase using samples whose confidence scores (or a different version of them) are available at the active party, in this paper, under the white box setting, we focus on the privacy leakage of samples whose confidence scores are not yet available at the active party.
This can include samples in the prediction phase for which no score has been requested by the active party, as well as samples used in the training phase to train the VFL model. Since the adversary is unaware of the confidence score of the attack target, we refer to this type of attack as an <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">agnostic inference attack</span>. Focusing on this type of privacy leakage, the main contributions of the paper are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<ul id="S1.I1" class="ltx_itemize">

<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The active party uses its available resources, i.e., the training data with only the active features, to reconstruct an independent classifier similar to the VFL model. This classifier is named the adversary model (AM). This is possible because the active party already has access to the ground truth labels of samples in the training set. The AM can be used for two purposes. First, as a means to estimate any sample’s confidence score and conduct inference attacks on the passive features using the methods introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The main aspect of this type of attack is that the adversary is agnostic to the confidence score or any other form of it corresponding to the attack target, hence putting all the training samples at risk of privacy leakage as well.
Second, by comparing the sample-by-sample scores obtained from the AM and VFL model during the prediction phase, the active party can use the amount of score mismatch as a measure of the improvement in classification due to the VFL and decide whether to continue or stop requesting further collaborative predictions. This is particularly useful when the active party incurs a cost for each VFL model prediction made through CA.</p>

<li id="S1.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the AM is primarily trained on the training samples, its ability to conduct an attack can be enhanced by taking into account the prediction samples and their associated confidence scores that have already been communicated to the active party. We consider two scenarios for delivering confidence scores: when they are delivered in their exact form and when their corresponding class labels are delivered to the active party. It is observed that incorporating both the confidence scores and their corresponding class labels leads to significant and subtle improvements in the effectiveness of an attack, respectively.
Observing that any any other forms<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Note that by “any other form”, we mean those which do not affect the accuracy.</span></span></span> of confidence scores, such as noisy or rounded scores, can be transformed into their corresponding class labels and utilized in the training of the AM highlights the inadequacy of privacy-preserving schemes (PPSs) that only focus on protecting the confidence scores. This realization prompts a reconsideration of PPSs in the context of VFL, with the main focus on the model parameters rather than the confidence scores, which departs from black and white views in VFL settings.</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose PPSs as a defense mechanism against agnostic inference attacks. The proposed schemes are designed to maintain the utility of the VFL model, i.e., delivering confidence scores in their exact form, while at the same time preventing adversaries from misusing the VFL collaboration. To that end, we design algorithms in a case-by-case fashion, where the parameters corresponding to passive features are distorted. The level of distortion applied to passive parameters is variable and determines the degree of privacy leakage of the passive party. That is, a higher level of distortion applied to passive parameters results in a lower degree of privacy compromise. This creates a trade-off between interpretability of the VFL parameters/outcomes by the active party and privacy concerns of the passive party. To address the privacy-interpretability (PI) trade-off, we aim to find a balance that satisfies the needs of both parties to the greatest extent possible, rather than completely shielding the passive party from view or completely obscuring the active party’s understanding of the parameters. Our goal is to strike a balance between these two competing demands and find a solution that partially meets the needs of both parties</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">VFL is a type of distributive ML model training approach in which two or more parties are involved in the training process, such that they hold the same set of samples with disjoint set of features. The main goal in VFL is to train a model in a privacy-preserving manner, i.e., to collaboratively train a model without each party having access to other parties’ features. Typically, the training involves a trusted third party known as the CA, and it is commonly assumed that only one party has access to the label information in the training and testing datasets. This party is named <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">active</span> and the remaining parties are called <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">
passive</span>. Throughout this paper, we assume that only two parties are involved; one is active and the other is passive. The active party is assumed to be <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">honest but curious</span>, i.e., it obeys the protocols exactly, but may try to infer passive features based on the information received. As a result, the active party is exchangeably referred to as the <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adversary</span> in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the existing VFL frameworks, CA’s main task is to coordinate the learning process once it has been initiated by the active party.
During the training, CA receives the intermediate model updates from each party, and after a set of computations, backpropagates each party’s gradient updates, separately and securely.
To meet the privacy requirements of parties’ datasets, cryptographic techniques such as secure multi-party computation (SMC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> or homomorphic encryption (HE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> are used.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Once the global model is trained, upon the request of the active party for a new record prediction, each party computes the results of their model using their own features.
CA aggregates these results from all the parties, obtains the prediction vector (confidence scores), and delivers that to the active party for further action.
Throughout this paper, we assume that the active party is not allowed to make any query about the scores of the samples in the training set.
This is justified due to the fact that the active party already has the ground truth labels of the training set.
Note that there could be some edge cases where confidence scores of all the samples (both in the training and prediction phases) are required, such as when the active party aims at forming a soft clustering among all the samples via <span id="S2.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Gaussian mixture model</span> to determine a high-confidence region within each class<span id="footnote6" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">6</span>For instance, in the Bank-FinTech example, the bank may wish to grant credit approval for clients with low entropy confidence scores due to budget limitations.</span></span></span>.
Where this is the case, i.e., exact or distorted versions of attack targets’ scores are available at the active party, inference attack methods studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> could be applied to reconstruct the passive features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, we assume that the active party has no information whatsoever about the underlying distribution of passive features. However, it is assumed that the knowledge about the names, types and ranges of passive features is available to the active party to decide whether to participate in a VFL or not.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the Bank dataset, there are a total of 20 features. However, as stated in the dataset’s description file on the Machine Learning Repository website <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the 11th feature has a significant impact on the output target and should be disregarded in order to obtain a more accurate predictive model. As a result, the training process in our study is based on 19 features, as detailed in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ III Datasets and model ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. Additionally, this dataset has 10 categorical features which need to be handled properly by the predictive model. Common ways to do this include one-hot encoding of the categorical features, mapping ordinal values to each category, mapping categorical values to theirs statistics, and so on. In this paper, we have chosen to map each categorical feature to its average within each class. This approach has been found to be effective for models such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Neural Networks (NN).</p>

<p id="S3.p3.2" class="ltx_p">In our selection of datasets for the purpose of classification, we have considered a number of key factors. Firstly, it is crucial that the LR model performs reasonably well on the chosen dataset. Here, we have chosen the minimum 85% test accuracy as a threshold below which a dataset is discarded from the experiments. This is essential as any less reliable confidence scores produced by the LR model would make it difficult to demonstrate the impact of the agnostic inference attack.
Secondly, it is necessary that each feature in the dataset contributes significantly to the training of the VFL model.

This was avoided in our experiments by utilizing feature importance calculation methods.
Thirdly, the dataset chosen should not have a diagonal covariance matrix associated to its features. As will be explained later, an agnostic inference attack on datasets with a diagonal covariance matrix does not result in a substantial breach of privacy.
To further emphasize this point, we have included the Grid dataset as an example, in which we provide a clear explanation of why this type of attack is not effective on these types of datasets.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recall that we study a scenario where prediction scores (exact forms or other) of attack targets are not available at the active party.
When evaluating the potential inference attacks within this context, it is important to consider the passive party’s vulnerabilities due to not just the white box setting, but also the availability of data to the active party.
This aspect of the scenario (the active party’s data) is often overlooked or underestimated in the related literature, but it can play a significant role in the success or failure of an attack.
The active party’s access to data and the quality of that data can greatly impact their ability to carry out an effective inference attack.
Despite the limitations imposed by the lack of access to prediction scores, the active party can still utilize the data and resources available to them to conduct an inference attack on passive features during both the training and prediction phases. To achieve this, the active party can build an independent AM using the training data at their disposal.
This allows the active party to estimate the confidence scores of their target, empowering them to carry out a successful attack.
To build an AM, the active party trains a classifier, denoted by <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}}:\mathcal{Y}\to\mathcal{U}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">f</mi><msub id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">𝜽</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">a</mi></msub></msub><mo lspace="0.278em" rspace="0.278em" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">:</mo><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">𝒴</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">→</mo><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">𝒰</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">:</ci><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑓</ci><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2">𝜽</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3">𝑎</ci></apply></apply><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1">→</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝒴</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝒰</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}}:\mathcal{Y}\to\mathcal{U}</annotation></semantics></math>, using only the active features, independently of the passive party and CA.

To take advantage of this increased reliability, the active party could adopt a training approach where the objective loss function incorporates the scores received from the CA. This can be done in a way that during the AM training, a higher cost is incurred in the event of a mismatch between the refined AM’s scores and the scores received from CA.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We study two cases for this scenario: case i) when the confidence scores are delivered to the active party in their exact form, and case ii) when the class labels corresponding to the scores are provided instead.
It’s important to note that as long as the delivered scores retain their accuracy, (at the very least) they can be converted into their corresponding class labels and utilized for refining the AM.
Our experimental results indicate that refining the AM via confidence scores and class labels leads to pronounced and subtle improvement of an attack performance by the active party, respectively.</p>

We will consider two scenarios: i) <math id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d&lt;k" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1"><lt id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></lt><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">d&lt;k</annotation></semantics></math>, and ii) <math id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d\geq k" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">≥</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1"><geq id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1"></geq><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">d\geq k</annotation></semantics></math>.

The case of interest where the active party do not have the attack target’s confidence score, is an example of an overdetermined system with no solution.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.5" class="ltx_p">In the study presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, several inference attack methods were evaluated, including RCC1, RCC2, CLS, and half<sup id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.5.1" class="ltx_sup">∗</sup>. These methods were found to significantly improve the adversary’s estimation quality, resulting in lower MSE compared to the methods discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
While the results and discussions for agnostic inference attack in this paper are general and apply to any of the feature estimation methods, for the purposes of this paper, we specifically focus on using the half<sup id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.5.2" class="ltx_sup">∗</sup> method.
This is because, on the one hand, the half<sup id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.5.3" class="ltx_sup">∗</sup> method is analytically feasible, making it easier to study. On the other hand, as indicated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, Figure 4]</cite>, the half<sup id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.5.4" class="ltx_sup">∗</sup> reconstruction method was found to have the best performance, or at least performance comparable to the best method. Thus, before proceeding with our analysis, we briefly outline the half<sup id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.5.5" class="ltx_sup">∗</sup> estimation method.</p>

Therefore, the adversary’s performance in this scenario cannot surpass the performance obtained when the exact form of confidence scores is known.
However, neither the active party nor the passive party have access to the exact form of the confidence scores or the parameters of AM, respectively, making it impossible for them to determine the exact value of (<a href="#S4.E18" title="In IV-C2 𝑑≥𝑘 ‣ IV-C Performance Analysis ‣ IV Agnostic Inference Attack ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>).

To handle such cases, there are multiple strategies that can be implemented, including but not limited to: i) Mapping the individual components of the solution to the closest value of 0 or 1 if they are outside of the feasible region, ii) Mapping those individual components to the value of 0.5, or iii) Mapping all the passive features to 0.5 once an estimated feature of a sample falls outside the feasible region.
It is important to note that the selection of the best strategy depends on the underlying data statistics and requires deeper knowledge of the data which is indeed not available at the active party. Therefore, in order to ensure fairness in our numerical results, this paper adopts the first strategy in all datasets used in our experiments.</p>

The majority of these algorithms have attempted to alter the confidence scores delivered to the active party in some way.
However, as demonstrated in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Adversary Model (AM) ‣ IV Agnostic Inference Attack ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and discussed in section <a href="#S4" title="IV Agnostic Inference Attack ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, simply modifying the confidence scores is not enough to defend against agnostic inference attacks, where the adversary can build a separate classifier and improve their attack as they collect more scores from the CA.

A straightforward approach would be to implement a black box setting, in which the active party is not privy to the passive party’s parameters, <math id="S5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{W}_{\textnormal{pas}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝐖</mi><mtext id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3a.cmml">pas</mtext></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐖</ci><ci id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3a.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">pas</mtext></ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathbf{W}_{\textnormal{pas}}</annotation></semantics></math>.
However, this approach sacrifices interpretability of the VFL model, which is a critical aspect in many applications where the client or user demands a clear explanation for the decisions made by the machine.
This creates a tension between the active party, who desires a white box setting for interpretability purposes, and the passive party, who values privacy and prefers a black box setting.
Therefore, there is a pressing need for a more nuanced and balanced approach to designing PPSs in the context of VFL, one that strikes a delicate balance between privacy and interpretability, and minimizes the cost of collaboration for all involved parties. The following sections present an effort towards realizing this elusive goal of balancing privacy and interpretability in VFL.</p>

However, preserving feasibility often requires the use of an orthonormalization process, which can lead to low scalability, particularly when the number of columns is substantial.
Thus, it is essential to employ an efficient approach that maintains the structure of the orthogonality constraints when solving (<a href="#S5.E22" title="In V-A1 Optimization problems with orthogonality constraint ‣ V-A Preliminaries ‣ V Privacy against agnostic inference attack ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">22</span></a>).

In that study, the proof approach relies on Von Neumann’s trace inequality, which can serve as an alternative to the optimization over Stiefel manifolds discussed in this paper. However, as will be made evident in the following sections, the optimization over Stiefel manifolds has a distinct advantage in that it allows for the treatment of a wide range of more complex problems through the use of iterative algorithms.</span></p>

Firstly, the assumption that the adversary will use the least square method is unrealistic as there are other inference attack methods that are more advanced and efficient. Secondly, transforming the parameter or feature space, as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, Theorem 3, Remark 6]</cite>), results in a significant and uncontrolled distortion of the parameters. This can make it difficult for the active party to interpret the results of the VFL model, and may even obstruct their ability to justify the outcomes in certain circumstances. For example, in the Bank-FinTech scenario, the bank may be required to provide a justification for rejecting a customer’s credit card application. Thus, it is crucial that these limitations are taken into consideration when designing any PPS so as to ensure the active party’s concerns are addressed.</span></p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The widespread adoption of machine learning-based automation systems in various sectors of society, including governments, banking, healthcare, and education, has become increasingly common. Although these systems bring many operational benefits, there are also important challenges that need to be addressed. One such challenge in the context of VFL is the interpretability of machine-based decisions when passive parties participate in the training of VFL using PPSs. This becomes particularly relevant in cases where VFL models are used to make decisions that have legal, insurance, or health implications, as a lack of justifiability of the outcomes can potentially harm the trust relationship between users and the system.</p>

Simple machine learning models such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and Lasso/Ridge regression are generally preferred over more complex deep learning models when performance levels are comparable, as they offer greater interpretability.

It is obvious that, in this case, not only a fixed scaling but any linear transformation of the parameters (which results in an overdetermined system with no solution) cannot keep the parameters secret indefinitely.
As discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, section VI]</cite>, the active party can collect valuable statistical information from received confidence scores (if the exact forms are provided) over time, which could be used to estimate the actual values of the parameters.</span></p>

However, the implementation of the pseudo-inverse of a matrix is technically challenging, which restricts the extension of these cases to cases i and ii. Nevertheless, these approaches not only offer the potential to find better solutions when they are feasible, but also provide valuable insights into how far the designs proposed for cases i and ii are from the more general solutions (when both cases are applicable on a dataset).</span></p>

Assume that the Bank data, which has 19 features, is considered. Also, consider the case that we are interested in obtaining the MSE when the active and passive parties have 14 and 5 features, respectively. Since these 19 features are not i.i.d., the MSE depends on which 5 (out of 19) features are allocated to the passive party. In order to resolve this issue, we average the MSE over some different possibilities of allocating 5 features to the passive party. More specifically, we average the MSE over a moving window of size 5 features, i.e., MSE is obtained for 19 scenarios where the feature indices of the passive party are <math id="S6.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="[1:5],[2:6],[3:7],\ldots,\{19\}\cup[1:4]" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.6.m6.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.6.m6.1b"><mrow id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.1"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.1.1">[</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.1.2">1</mn><mo lspace="0.278em" rspace="0.278em" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.1.3">:</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.1.4">5</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.1.5">]</mo></mrow><mo id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.2">,</mo><mrow id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.3"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.3.1">[</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.3.2">2</mn><mo lspace="0.278em" rspace="0.278em" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.3.3">:</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.3.4">6</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.3.5">]</mo></mrow><mo id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.4">,</mo><mrow id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.5"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.5.1">[</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.5.2">3</mn><mo lspace="0.278em" rspace="0.278em" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.5.3">:</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.5.4">7</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.5.5">]</mo></mrow><mo id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.6">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.7">…</mi><mo id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.8">,</mo><mrow id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.9"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.9.1">{</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.9.2">19</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.9.3">}</mo></mrow><mo id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.10">∪</mo><mrow id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.11"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.11.1">[</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.11.2">1</mn><mo lspace="0.278em" rspace="0.278em" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.11.3">:</mo><mn id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.11.4">4</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1.11.5">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.6.m6.1c">[1:5],[2:6],[3:7],\ldots,\{19\}\cup[1:4]</annotation></semantics></math>.

As this is an evaluation for agnostic attacks, the MSE is calculated by considering both the training and prediction samples.
It should be noted that since the scores obtained from AM are estimated values of the scores obtained from the VFL model, it is possible that even in the case of <math id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d&lt;k" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mo id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1b"><apply id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1"><lt id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.1"></lt><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p1.8.m8.1c">d&lt;k</annotation></semantics></math>, the estimated passive features are outside the feasible region (for <math id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d&gt;k" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mo id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1b"><apply id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1"><gt id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.1"></gt><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p1.9.m9.1c">d&gt;k</annotation></semantics></math>, the system is underdetermined and there is no guarantee that the solution will be in the feasible region).
In such cases, the individual features that are outside the feasible region are mapped to either 0 or 1, whichever is closest.
For the half estimation, all the passive features are estimated as half.
The results show that even without the exact values of the target’s confidence scores, it is still possible to achieve a good performance on the inference attack using AM.
For the bank, satellite, and adult datasets, the attack performance using AM is close to the half<sup id="S6.SS1.p1.11.2" class="ltx_sup">∗</sup> method via the VFL model in which the adversary has access to the exact values of the target’s confidence scores.
Moreover, refining AM using (<a href="#S4.Ex1" title="IV-B1 Refined AM ‣ IV-B Adversary Model (AM) ‣ IV Agnostic Inference Attack ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span>1</span></a>) with only 100 scores significantly improves the attack performance, especially when the number of passive features is small. This is mainly because the active party has the advantage of a richer dataset (<math id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d_{t}-d&gt;d" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.cmml"><msub id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">d</mi><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><mo id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.1.cmml">−</mo><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.3" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.3.cmml">d</mi></mrow><mo id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.1.cmml">&gt;</mo><mi id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.3.cmml">d</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1b"><apply id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1"><gt id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.1"></gt><apply id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2"><minus id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.1"></minus><apply id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.2.3">𝑡</ci></apply><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.2.3">𝑑</ci></apply><ci id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1.1.3">𝑑</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p1.11.m11.1c">d_{t}-d&gt;d</annotation></semantics></math>).

It can be seen that incorporating more confidence scores during the refinement process of AM prior to the attack improves the attack performance.

It is important to note that tampering with either the confidence scores or the passive parameters can have adverse effects on either the accuracy of the decisions or the interpretability of the results, respectively. In many scenarios, it may be considered more crucial to maintain accuracy in decision-making than the interpretability of the outcomes. Furthermore, as it will be clearer in section <a href="#S6.SS2" title="VI-B Experimental results on privacy-preserving schemes ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-B</span></span></a>, for some cases, a small perturbation of the passive parameters can result in a significant improvement in preserving privacy while still allowing for some level of interpretability in the VFL model and keeping decisions accurate (delivering the confidence scores in the clear).</span></p>

The results show that the active party benefits more from VFL in the grid and pendigits datasets compared to the bank, satellite and adult datasets. This is because as the number of active features increases, the active party can achieve higher accuracy on the grid and pendigit datasets.
The results from Figure <a href="#S6.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ VI-A Experimental results on agnostic inference attack ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> in conjunction with the results from Figures <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI-A Experimental results on agnostic inference attack ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI-A Experimental results on agnostic inference attack ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> suggest that datasets that are more suitable for VFL collaboration and result in higher accuracy from VFL collaboration are less susceptible to agnostic inference attacks. This is a crucial aspect to consider for the active party when deciding to participate in a VFL collaboration, especially if the active party incurs costs for both VFL training and prediction. Overall, these results highlight the importance of understanding the relationship between VFL collaboration, decision accuracy, model interpretability and the vulnerability to inference attacks when considering participation in a VFL collaboration.</span></p>

It is worth to note two key aspects regarding the results. First, the inclusion of the results of case i is merely intended to provide a comparison with the more general PPS approach in case iv, and they are not applicable for datasets with <math id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k=2" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑘</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p3.3.m3.1c">k=2</annotation></semantics></math>. As seen from the figures, while the results of case i deviate quickly from those of case iv, they remain close to each other in the region of interest, which is approximately 0.18 and 0.14 for the bank and adult datasets, respectively, as indicated in Figure <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (see the MSE obtained from half estimation). Furthermore, as the value of <math id="S6.SS2.p3.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p3.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S6.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml">d</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p3.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S6.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.4.m4.1.1">𝑑</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p3.4.m4.1c">d</annotation></semantics></math> increases, the results from case i and case iv converge, as shown in the rightmost plots in Figure <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ VI-A Experimental results on agnostic inference attack ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
Second, the preference for both the passive and active parties in terms of privacy and interpretability is that a small amount of perturbation in the passive parameters leads to a noticeable MSE resulted from inference attacks. This way, both parties meet their concerns with a minimal passive parameter perturbation. This is equivalent to having a concave PI trade-off curve. However, as observed from Figure <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ VI-A Experimental results on agnostic inference attack ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> and the results throughout this section, the PI trade-off achieved by the proposed PPSs for different datasets and under different cases can sometimes be convex, sometimes concave, and in some cases, neither. It remains an open question whether the optimal PI trade-off curve in the region of interest follows a certain shape, preferably concave.</p>

To obtain the PI curve for the bank and adult datasets, we utilized the result from Remark (<a href="#Thmremark11" title="Remark 11. ‣ V-B3 Case 𝑑=1 ‣ V-B Privacy-preserving schemes ‣ V Privacy against agnostic inference attack ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>), while for the remaining datasets, the optimization problem in (<a href="#S5.E50" title="In V-B3 Case 𝑑=1 ‣ V-B Privacy-preserving schemes ‣ V Privacy against agnostic inference attack ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">50</span></a>) was solved. The approach in this case is considered more comprehensive as it does not impose any limitations on the mapping between the passive parameters and the parameters that the active party has given access to. Note that, as shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI Experimental Results ‣ Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the MSE for the half estimation on the satellite, bank, pendigits, and adult datasets is approximately 0.04, 0.17, 0.12, and 0.12, respectively. This leads to the observation that the PI curve below this MSE level for each of these datasets is almost linear. This observation is promising in the sense that the PPS is capable of delivering a balance between privacy and interpretability concerns of the parties, despite the general non-concave PI trade-off curve.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we examine the intricacies of a white-box VFL setting where two parties are involved in constructing a classifier collaboratively. The active party has access to the labels while the passive party contributes by sharing a separate set of features for the same samples. This collaboration takes place under the supervision of a third trusted entity known as the CA.
Previous studies, such as those in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, have explored various inference attack methods that mainly rely on the active party’s exploitation of the confidence scores during the prediction phase.
However, in this study, we delve into a novel approach of inference attack, which does not require the active party to have access to the target’s confidence score. The adversary uses their available training set, including labels and active party features, to construct a classifier that is then used to estimate the target’s confidence score. Once the estimation is obtained, the active party uses one of the previously studied inference attack methods to carry out the attack. This attack is referred to as “agnostic” due to the absence of the target’s confidence score at the active party, which as a result puts all the samples used in the training phase at the risk of privacy exposure.
Our findings show that the performance of the adversary’s model can be significantly enhanced by incorporating the confidence scores received from CA. This results in more accurate estimates of the target’s confidence score, which, in turn, can lead to more successful inference attacks.
Since this type of attack does not rely on the availability of an attack target’s confidence score, it is therefore unaffected of any PPSs applied to the confidence scores, such as rounding or adding noise.</p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To counter the aforementioned potential for privacy breaches in a VFL setting, various privacy-preserving schemes (PPSs) have been proposed with a focus on protecting the passive parameters.
To that end, we consider the development of PPSs that intentionally distort the passive parameters in a systematic manner.
The active party is given access to these distorted parameters instead of the original versions.
In designing these PPSs, we carefully consider the need for interpretability by the active party while still safeguarding the privacy of the passive party.
This, in turn, gives rise to a trade-off between the interpretability of the VFL model for the active party and the privacy concerns of the passive party.
Our approach moves away from a black or white viewpoint in VFL and instead aims to find a suitable balance between the needs of both parties to mitigate the risk of collaboration.
Our goal is not to completely obscure the active party or completely protect the passive party, but rather to strike a balance between the two in order to minimize potential privacy risks.</p>
