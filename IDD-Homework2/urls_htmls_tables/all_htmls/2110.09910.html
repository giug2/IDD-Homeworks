<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is able to manage edge devices to cooperatively train a model while maintaining the training data local and private. One common assumption in FL is that all edge devices share the same machine learning model in training, for example, identical neural network architecture.
However, the computation and store capability of different devices may not be the same. Moreover, reducing communication overheads can improve the training efficiency though it is still a challenging problem in FL. In this paper, we propose a novel FL method, called FedHe, inspired by knowledge distillation, which can train heterogeneous models and support asynchronous training processes with significantly reduced communication overheads. Our analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is better than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of communication overheads and model accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Massive data is created with the proliferation of edge devices. Handling large amount of data becomes a challenging problem in this information era. Distributed machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is proposed to coordinate massive data management in the data centers, which is turning into a crucial technique. However, accessing and processing data with distributed machine learning algorithms at remote servers has raised data privacy concerns from the users.
<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated learning</span> (FL) has been proposed as a machine learning paradigm that aims to perform machine learning on massive and distributed data without invading data privacy. More concisely, FL coordinates clients and servers to train a shared global model, while keeping the data locally at the edge devices. The general FL architecture was first proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which is composed of servers and clients. The work has attracted a lot of attention and led to many follow-up studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although many researchers focus on FL and there are many applications such as predicting human activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and learning sentiment<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, it still has many practical challenges to be solved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. One of the most important challenges comes from system heterogeneity, which causes many issues in FL. System heterogeneity usually refers to various computation and bandwidth resources among different participating devices. It would lead to a common but undesirable situation that incompetent devices drag the convergence speed of the server model. These devices, called stragglers, are not able to complete their training when the other efficient participants finish their model training processes. However, many FL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> are not designed to handle this practical problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some studies focus on how to design an asynchronous training scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to alleviate this problem. This is a straightforward way to deal with the problem caused by stragglers.
Different from the above works, we take a new approach to handle system heterogeneity and provide a more general and practical solution by supporting heterogeneous model architectures for devices with different capabilities. For example, the model architectures of neural networks could be chosen individually, depending on the computation power and bandwidth resources of the participating devices. When the devices have chosen suitable model structures, they are able to complete the training process faster and potentially simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, model weights or gradients are aggregated in the server and shared with the local devices. Although local data are kept private, exchanging model parameters between the clients and the serve occupies a lot of bandwidth. Moreover, the model architectures of the clients and the server have to be identical in order to aggregate the model in common FL methods. A few research studies have attempted to support heterogeneous models in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, their approaches require a public dataset in the server, which is comprised of a portion of each private dataset or an existing dataset. Obtaining part of the local private dataset from clients may violate user privacy. It is also difficult to have an existing dataset which is similar to the private datasets. Therefore, how to transfer knowledge between devices with heterogeneous model architectures still remains to be a research challenge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the above problem, we propose a novel method called Heterogeneous models and Efficient Federated learning (<span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FedHe</span>), inspired by knowledge distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. FedHe takes an asynchronous FL approach and supports training of heterogeneous models with small communication overheads.
Knowledge distillation is a model compression method, which a heavy teacher model distills knowledge and transmits it to a light student model. In our method, we conduct a training process using this knowledge, generated by the clients and processed in the server, to replace the exchanges and updates of weights in the original FL methods. In our approach, participants can share knowledge with each other successfully without deploying a public dataset. Our method can run in an asynchronous mode, which is easier to deploy in real FL environment and preserve user privacy. Our experimental results show that our algorithm converges in an asynchronous setting with satisfactory model accuracy and significantly reduced communication overheads.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), was first proposed by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> in 2017. It provides a novel method to organize computing among edge devices. It is a synchronous algorithm that can compute model weights from randomly selected clients iteratively. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> manages the training process synchronously under non-i.i.d. data setting. However, many of the FL schemes are synchronous algorithms.
FedAsyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> makes an asynchronous training scheme with coordinators and schedulers, and uses a weighted average to update the global model. Although our work does not focus on asynchronous FL, our proposed method, FedHe, can work in an asynchronous fashion, which makes it more practical and easier to be deployed in the real world.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hinton et al. proposed knowledge distillation for neural networks in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The initial goal of this method is to compress heavy neural networks. A heavy teacher model transmits its knowledge, called logits, to a light student model, while the student model performs training based on the same dataset and logits. Federated Distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> discussed how to use logits in the homogeneous models FL. Kim et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> used a paraphraser as a teacher network and a translator as a student model to communicate the latent knowledge, called “factors”, with each other. SemCKD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> applied attention allocation to match intermediate knowledge from teacher layers to the appropriate student layers, which is a cross-layer distillation method. In this work, we proposes FedHe, inspired by the basic method in knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, to enable knowledge sharing among various clients in FL efficiently.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Supporting heterogeneous models in FL environment is a big challenge. FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> introduced logits from a large public dataset. The clients can learn the data features from the logits and their private datasets. FedML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> applied latent information from homogeneous models to train heterogeneous models. FedH2L <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> adopted logits from a public dataset consisted of private data instances from different clients. It keeps the optimized directions from the public and private datasets the same. In contrast, we do not need a public dataset in our method. The logits, capturing knowledge from private datasets, are collected from the training processes of clients, but they do not invade user privacy. Our experiments show that FedHe can support FL with homogeneous and heterogeneous models, since the exchange of logits depends only on the number of output classes and is generic to different model architectures.</p>

Thus, the server has to maintain a storage for storing the logits and their corresponding labels, i.e. <math id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(p_{k,y_{i}},y_{i})" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.cmml">(</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.cmml">p</mi><mrow id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.2.cmml">y</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub></mrow></msub><mo id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.4" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.2.cmml">y</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.5" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4b"><interval closure="open" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2"><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.3.3.1.1.2">𝑝</ci><list id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2"><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1">𝑘</ci><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></list></apply><apply id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4.4.2.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.m1.4c">(p_{k,y_{i}},y_{i})</annotation></semantics></math>, from the clients.

(<a href="#S4.E4" title="In IV-A Training on private data ‣ IV Our Proposed Method ‣ FedHe: Heterogeneous Models and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Accepted by The 17th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2021)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). The clients continue to collect their logits and transmit these logits to the server. When the server receives logits from the clients, the FedHe training process will begin to incorporate average logits.</p>

The model weights come from the neural networks trained in the clients. The logits are inputs of the softmax layer, which are deployed in FedHe and FedMD. Transmitting samples are the images used from the public dataset in FedMD. The clients are required to obtain those data samples from the public dataset.
Since the dimensions of images are different between MNIST and CIFAR-10, we use two tables to show their results.</p>

The highest model accuracy is achieved by FedAvg, which reaches 99% in MNIST and almost 69% in CIFAR-10. We also observe that FedAvg converges faster than the other methods. This observation is reasonable because FedAvg transmits model weights in model updates. However, when we consider the communication cost, we can see that FedHe is much more efficient as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-C Training on logits ‣ IV Our Proposed Method ‣ FedHe: Heterogeneous Models and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Accepted by The 17th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2021)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-C Training on logits ‣ IV Our Proposed Method ‣ FedHe: Heterogeneous Models and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Accepted by The 17th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2021)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

Although its communication overheads are so small, FedHe still obtains very high accuracy compared with FedAvg. FedHe achieves model accuracy of 98.9% in MNIST and 66% in CIFAR-10. The baseline Private method reaches 98.4% in MNIST and 62.5% in CIFAR-10, which is higher than another baseline FedMD that obtained 97.9% in MNIST and 60.9% in CIFAR-10. We do not show the pretraining process of FedMD in Fig. <a href="#S5.F0.sf3.1" title="In V-A Experiment setting ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedHe: Heterogeneous Models and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Accepted by The 17th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2021)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">0(c)</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F0.sf4.1" title="In V-A Experiment setting ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedHe: Heterogeneous Models and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Accepted by The 17th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2021)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">0(d)</span></a>, which is for training on their public datasets until convergence.

If this subset of public dataset does not have sufficient knowledge, the clients may find it difficult to learn more information than their own private datasets.</p>

In heterogeneous FL, all the clients may keep different architectures of their neural networks. Since FedAvg does not support heterogeneous models, it can not be used as a baseline in heterogeneous FL. From the experiment results, FedHe achieves the highest model accuracy, 98.5% in MNIST and 62% in CIFAR-10.
Private obtains lower accuracy than FedHe, which indicates that exchange of logits in FedHe is valuable. We also discover that FedMD performs better than Private in these experiments.
Private attains 98% in MNIST and 57% in CIFAR-10, while FedMD achieves 98% in MNIST and 57.5% in CIFAR-10. These results indicate that FedMD can support heterogeneous models, though it still has a large performance gap with FedHe. The clients transmit only small amount of information for knowledge exchange in FedHe, but it achieves superior performance. Compared with FedMD, FedHe also consumes less bandwidth according to Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-C Training on logits ‣ IV Our Proposed Method ‣ FedHe: Heterogeneous Models and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Accepted by The 17th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2021)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-C Training on logits ‣ IV Our Proposed Method ‣ FedHe: Heterogeneous Models and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Accepted by The 17th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2021)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

It may be due to knowledge communication in the training process. The clients have to learn from both their private dataset and the average logits from the server. The two components may lead to different optimized directions in the training process. Nevertheless, the knowledge from the average logits will still improve the model accuracy eventually. Although the convergence speed of FedHe is slower than Private, its model accuracy is much higher than Private.</p>

In both methods, the clients train their models first, then transmit their knowledge to the server. The server aggregates the knowledge and sends back to the clients.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel FL scheme, called FedHe, which supports training of heterogeneous models in clients by exchanging logits. Logits capture important features of instances in individual classes. The logits are aggregated at the server and shared with the clients as side information to enhance model training.
Our solution supports heterogeneous models and asynchronous communications. The clients transmit logit information, instead of model parameters, for knowledge exchange.
The communication overhead of FedHe is less than one percent of traditional FedAvg. In addition, FedHe does not require any public dataset for pretraining, so it can preserve data privacy. Our experimental results demonstrated that FedHe can train heterogeneous models with satisfactory model accuracy and significantly reduced communication overheads.</p>
