<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) are privacy-preserving Machine-Learning (ML) techniques that enable training ML models over data distributed among clients without requiring direct access to their raw data. Existing FL and SL approaches work on horizontally or vertically partitioned data and cannot handle sequentially partitioned data where segments of multiple-segment sequential data are distributed across clients. In this paper, we propose a novel federated split learning framework, FedSL, to train models on distributed sequential data. The most common ML models to train on sequential data are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Since the proposed framework is privacy preserving, segments of multiple-segment sequential data cannot be shared between clients or between clients and server. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a novel SL approach tailored for RNNs. A RNN is split into sub-networks, and each sub-network is trained on one client containing single segments of multiple-segment training sequences. During local training, the sub-networks on different clients communicate with each other to capture latent dependencies between consecutive segments of multiple-segment sequential data on different clients, but without sharing raw data or complete model parameters. After training local sub-networks with local sequential data segments, all clients send their sub-networks to a federated server where sub-networks are aggregated to generate a global model. The experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully trains models on distributed sequential data, while preserving privacy, and outperforms previous FL and centralized learning approaches in terms of achieving higher accuracy in fewer communication rounds.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conventional Machine-Learning (ML) algorithms, models are usually developed in a centralized setting, i.e. the data generated by local clients are firstly aggregated into a server, and the training is performed on the server. However, the client’s personal data is privacy-sensitive and can be large in quantity, which disqualifies centralized ML methods from sending local data to the server. Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2017communicationefficient </a></cite> and Split Learning (SL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">gupta2018distributed </a></cite> are distributed collaborative ML techniques that decouple model training from the need for direct access to the raw data of clients.</p>

On the other hand, SL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">gupta2018distributed </a></cite> trains a model, e.g. a neural network, where the network is split into two sub-networks; one sub-network is trained on client and the other is trained on server. Existing FL and SL approaches are applicable to horizontally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2017communicationefficient </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">he2020fedml </a>; <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">yang2019federated </a>; <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020survey </a></cite> or vertically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2020vafl </a>; <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">cheng2019secureboost </a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">feng2020multiparticipant </a>; <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2020communication </a></cite> partitioned data, and cannot handle sequentially partitioned data occurring frequently in practice. In sequentially partitioned data, where training sequences are sequentially distributed across clients, consecutive segments of multiple-segment sequential data are generated and available on different clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As a concrete example of sequentially partitioned data, suppose one patient is consecutively admitted to two different hospitals each recording sequential vital signs of the patient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">pollard2018eicu </a></cite>, e.g. heart rate. In this case, the heart rate of the patient is sequentially distributed across two hospitals/clients. This multiple-segment sequential data can be used to train ML models to predict, for instance, the mortality of patients. The most common ML models to train on sequential data are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including the vanilla RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">sherstinsky2020fundamentals </a></cite>. Due to privacy concerns, the clients are not allowed to share the segments of sequential data. One solution to decouple training RNN from segment sharing between clients is to split RNN into sub-networks each being trained on single clients containing single segments of sequential data. Existing SL approaches work on feed-forward neural networks, and cannot be used for RNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">abuadbba2020use </a></cite>. RNNs, in order to train on sequentially partitioned data, should be split in a way that preserve latent dependencies between segments of multiple-segment sequential data available on different clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present FedSL, a novel collaborative ML framework utilizing FL, along with a novel SL approach tailored for RNNs, to take advantage of both approaches and to train models on sequentially partitioned data, while preserving the privacy of clients’ local data. Due to the privacy-preserving property of FL and SL approaches, data sharing between clients and also between clients and server is not allowed. Therefore, in FedSL, model training is performed locally on each client in collaboration with other clients and with the server. SL is performed between clients, and FL is performed between clients and the server. A RNN is split into two sub-networks to be trained with sequential training samples with multiple segments available on different clients. The first sub-network is trained with the first segment in one client, and the second sub-network is trained using the second segment in another client. During SL, these sub-networks of the split RNN, on different clients, collaborate and communicate to learn from their local segments without sharing data or model parameters to other clients. These rounds of SL are repeated whenever new training sequential segments are generated in consecutive clients. After each round of SL, all clients send their locally trained sub-networks to the server where all received sub-networks are aggregated. These aggregated sub-networks are used as the initial model for the next rounds of FedSL. This process continues until the server acknowledges the convergence. Our primary contributions in this paper are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Other important points about data distribution in FL are the balance of data among clients, and if the data is independent and identically distributed (IID) among clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2017communicationefficient </a>; <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020convergence </a></cite>. Many works have been done to address the non-IID data issue in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">he2020fedml </a></cite>. For instance, Xiang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020convergence </a></cite> proposed an improved version of FedAvg with data sharing in which distributing a small amount of holdout IID data between clients results in a significant improvement in the performance of FL on non-IID data. Briggs et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">briggs2020federated </a></cite> proposed to separate clients in clusters based on the similarity of their locally trained models to the global model, and then train clusters of clients independently. In this way, higher accuracy on non-IID data is achieved compared to the vanilla FL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">While most FL frameworks work based on the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization, some other methods proposed modified versions of SGD to improve learning performance. In FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">mcmahan2017communicationefficient </a></cite>, clients run local SGD for a predetermined number of epochs. A modified version of FedAvg, LoAdaBoost, is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">huang2020loadaboost </a></cite> where for each client, after a certain number of epochs, if the local loss is higher than a threshold, the local epochs of training continue to decrease the local loss, otherwise local training finishes. Another modification of FedAvg is presented by Baheti et al. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">baheti2020federated </a></cite> in which the weights in FedAvg are modified based on the local loss of clients.

The client, containing training data, performs forward propagation and computes the output of its sub-network up to the cut layer. The cut layer’s output is sent to the server. The server computes the final output, until the last layer of the network. At server’s sub-network, the gradients are backpropagated from the last layer to the cut layer, and the gradient of the cut layer is sent back to the client. The client performs the rest of the backpropagation process from the cut layer to the first layer of the network. This process continues until the client has new training data.</p>

The only information being communicated between clients and the server is the output of the cut layer, from clients to the server, and the gradient of the cut layer, from the server to clients. However, one drawback of the vanilla SL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">gupta2018distributed </a></cite> is that the labels of training samples need to be transmitted from clients to the server.

SL algorithms can also be described based on the structure of data they analyze. The vanilla SL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">gupta2018distributed </a></cite> and U-shaped SL approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">vepakomma2018split </a></cite> described above are suitable for horizontal data where training samples in different clients share the same feature space but do not share the same sample ID space. In contrast, vertical SL approaches deal with data structures in which different features of the same training samples are available on different clients. Vepakomma et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">vepakomma2018split </a></cite> proposed a vertical SL configuration in which two clients containing different modalities of the same training samples train their specific sub-networks up to the cut layer.

Previous SL methods split feed-forward neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">gupta2018distributed </a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">abuadbba2020use </a>; <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">thapa2020splitfed </a>; <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">hanaccelerating </a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">mugunthan2021multi </a>; <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">thapa2021advancements </a></cite>, while FedSL splits recurrent neural networks. In the SplitFed method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">thapa2020splitfed </a></cite>, SL and FL are combined to work on horizontally partitioned data. In SplitFed, after SL between clients and a main server, complete model parameters are sent from clients to the fed server. It is against the main goal of SL which is to avoid complete model sharing among clients and server. In addition, in the SL step of SplitFed, label sharing is required among clients and the split server. However, in FedSL, the complete model is not shared and label sharing is not required between clients, or between clients and server.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our aim is to train ML models, in a privacy-preserving setting, on multiple-segment sequential data with segments distributed among clients (see Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Problem Definition ‣ 3 FedSL - A Novel Federated Split Learning Framework ‣ FedSL: Federated Split Learning on Distributed Sequential Data in Recurrent Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>). The common ML models for dealing with sequential data are RNNs, such as the vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">sherstinsky2020fundamentals </a></cite>. We introduce SL for RNNs. A RNN is split into sub-networks each being trained on one client and with one segment of multiple-segment training sequences.</p>

From a feed-forward layer, a feed-forward neural network is split between clients (containing training data) and server (containing training labels). However, RNNs have sequential (recurrent) structure to analyze sequential data. In the following, we explain how RNNs are split from recurrent layers.</p>

In order to model this temporal relation between segments, all segments should be given to one RNN. However, segments are available on different clients. In addition, in privacy-preserving SL algorithms, sharing segments between clients is not allowed. Therefore, A RNN (from the connections between hidden states) is split into sub-networks, each being trained on one client with one segment. The sub-networks communicate with each other through their hidden states in order to preserve the temporal relation between segments available on different clients.</p>

</span> with no next segments. While the vanilla RNN is considered in Algorithm 1, the proposed SL method is applicable to other RNNs, including GRUs, LSTMs, etc. Likewise, it is expandable to multi-layer and bidirectional RNNs. In this way, we will be able to train RNNs on sequentially partitioned data across clients without compromising privacy. Instead of sharing raw data or model parameters between clients, the only information being transmitted among clients is the activations of the hidden states and the gradient of the loss w.r.t. the activations of the hidden states.</p>

The FedSL achieves higher accuracy in fewer rounds of communication. This superiority of the proposed method is due to the byproducts of SL in RNNs in addition to preserving privacy (see Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS1" title="3.2.1 Byproducts of SL in Recurrent Neural Networks ‣ 3.2 Split Learning in Recurrent Neural Networks ‣ 3 FedSL - A Novel Federated Split Learning Framework ‣ FedSL: Federated Split Learning on Distributed Sequential Data in Recurrent Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2.1</span></a>).

Figure. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.1.1 (Sequential) MNIST ‣ 4.1 (Sequential) Image Classification ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedSL: Federated Split Learning on Distributed Sequential Data in Recurrent Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> depicts the learning curves of the above three cases in 500 rounds of communication using local batches of size 64 and 1 local epochs. In the first case, the FedAvg is used, because the data is not sequentially distributed. In the two-segment and three-segment cases, the FedSL with two and three sub-networks are used to handle sequentially distributed sequences. As can be seen in Figure. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.1.1 (Sequential) MNIST ‣ 4.1 (Sequential) Image Classification ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedSL: Federated Split Learning on Distributed Sequential Data in Recurrent Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, FedSL outperforms FedAvg in terms of achieving lower loss and higher accuracy in fewer rounds of communication. In addition, when three-segment sequences are distributed among clients (and three sub-networks are trained in SL), higher accuracy is achieved in comparison with two-segment sequence distribution where two sub-networks are trained in SL. This improvement from one-segment (using FedAvg) to three-segment sequences is due to the byproducts of SL in sequential neural networks in addition to preserving privacy (see Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS1" title="3.2.1 Byproducts of SL in Recurrent Neural Networks ‣ 3.2 Split Learning in Recurrent Neural Networks ‣ 3 FedSL - A Novel Federated Split Learning Framework ‣ FedSL: Federated Split Learning on Distributed Sequential Data in Recurrent Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2.1</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we defined and addressed the problem of training models in a federated privacy-preserving setting on distributed sequential data occurring frequently in practice. Sequentially partitioned data is different from the horizontal and vertical partitioned data studied in the previous FL and SL works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">yin2021comprehensive </a>; <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">thapa2021advancements </a></cite>. We presented a novel architecture that integrates FL and SL to address the problem of training models on sequentially partitioned data. In this architecture, none of the data, or label, or complete model parameters are shared between clients or between clients and the server. In order to analyze multiple segments of distributed sequential data, we introduced a novel SL approach tailored for RNNs. Consecutive splits of RNNs are trained on consecutive clients containing consecutive segments of multiple-segment sequential data distributed across clients. This SL approach for RNNs is different from the previous SL approaches working on feed-forward neural networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The experimental results on simulated and real-world multiple-segment sequential data (with different values of local epochs and local batch sizes, with different numbers of participants, and on IID and non-IID data) demonstrate that the proposed method successfully trains models on distributed sequential data, while preserving privacy, and outperforms previous FL and centralized learning approaches in terms of achieving higher accuracy in fewer communication rounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In future research, we plan to work on split learning in other sequential neural networks, including Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), 3D CNNs, and use the split sequential models in our proposed FedSL framework. In addition, we aim to apply modified versions of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">he2020fedml </a></cite> in the FedSL framework. Other directions of our further research are utilizing differential-privacy techniques in the FedSL framework, and working on techniques in SL to personalize split models for individual clients.
