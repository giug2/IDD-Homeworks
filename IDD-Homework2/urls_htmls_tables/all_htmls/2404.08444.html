<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In vehicle edge computing (VEC), asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is used, where the edge receives a local model and updates the global model, effectively reducing the global aggregation latency.Due to different amounts of local data,computing capabilities and locations of the vehicles, renewing the global model with same weight is inappropriate.The above factors will affect the local calculation time and upload time of the local model, and the vehicle may also be affected by Byzantine attacks, leading to the deterioration of the vehicle data. However, based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we can consider these factors comprehensively to eliminate vehicles with poor performance as much as possible and exclude vehicles that have suffered Byzantine attacks before AFL. At the same time, when aggregating AFL, we can focus on those vehicles with better performance to improve the accuracy and safety of the system. In this paper, we proposed a vehicle selection scheme based on DRL in VEC. In this scheme, vehicle’s mobility, channel conditions with temporal variations, computational resources with temporal variations, different data amount, transmission channel status of vehicles as well as Byzantine attacks were taken into account.Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively improves the safety and accuracy of the global model.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As vehicular networks advance, the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) emerges to enable some real-time applications like audio recognition and multimedia collaboration, aiming to enhance people’s daily lives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For IoV, vehicles get information from environment and use their local information to train models in order to enhance vehicle service capabilities. Because the computational capability is finite<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, so vehicles have to request and send information to a cloud which has strong computational capability. Accordingly, the cloud will process the information and provide the relevant vehicles with computational results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
However, the cloud is often located at a distance from the vehicle, and will cause a long transmission delay<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Vehicular edge computing (VEC) can solve this problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In the VEC, the road side unit (RSU) installed alongside the road can be alternatively used as the edge so that it can decrease the latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> .</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, because of the concerns over data privacy, vehicles frequently exhibit hesitancy in sharing information with one another. As a result, the RSU might encounter difficulties in accumulating a sufficient amount of information to train a precise model. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution to address this issue effectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, in conventional federated learning, the RSU iteratively refines the global model over multiple rounds. First, the RSU initializes a global model. During every iteration, each vehicle initially gets the global model from the RSU, and trains the local model using local data. Before next round training, the vehicle uploads its local model to the RSU, and then the RSU aggregates all received local models to renew the global model. The procedure continues until the global model converges or up to the maximum training round. In this way, it can eliminate privacy concerns by uploading model rather than the local information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In traditional FL, the synchronous update of the global model is a requisite. That is to say, before updating the global model, the RSU is required to wait until each vehicle has submitted its local model in each round.
Nonetheless, some straggler vehicles probably have a high local training delay and thus move beyond the range of the RSU before completing the current round training of its local model. As a result, the RSU is unable to aggregate the local models of these straggler vehicles in time, that will affect the global model’s precision. Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) offers a potential solution to address this issue effectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Specifically, upon receiving an uploaded local model, the RSU will proceed to update the global model. The requirement of synchronous uploading of every local model can be avoided by this process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In vehicular networks with edge assistance, vehicle mobility has to be taken into account <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The variation of the vehicle position can lead to a change in distance from the RSU, thus causing a change in its model transmission time<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the variation in data quantity and computation capabilities among vehicles will impact the local training time in AFL and time-varying features of channels will also affect the model upload rate.This is because channel conditions include path loss and channel gain, which in turn affect propagation rate, leading to changes in upload delay.
Particularly, the time-changing mobility patterns of vehicles can result in varied transmission rates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, consequently leading to diverse transmission delays, which refer to the time taken for uploading the local model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the heterogeneous computing capabilities and data sizes of vehicles contribute to distinct local training delays for their respective local models.
In case that the duration between downloading global model and uploading local model is large for a vehicle, RSU might have already revised the global model by using local models from other vehicles. Under this circumstance, this vehicle’s local model is staleness. Furthermorer, it will affect AFL’s training and also decrease global model’s precision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Thus, the vehicles’ mobility, data magnitude and computational resources are very important. It is crucial to give consideration to the vehicles’s mobility, data magnitude and computing capabilities to renew the global model with different weights and select the vehicles with better performance for global aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In AFL, vehicles’ data may be attacked by Byzantine attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the Byzantine attacks will affect the vehicles’ local data, tamper the data or labels and degrade the local models’ precision. In that case it can leads to global model’s reduction at the RSU.
Thus, the prevention of Byzantine attacks is significantly important for AFL in VEC. Therefore, it is of great significance to consider vehicle’s mobility, time-changing computational capabilities, data size, time-changing channel properties, Byzantine attacks and select the proper vehicles to improve global model’s precision during VEC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

The reason for why adopted the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm in the DRL stage is that DDPG is suitable for continuous action state spaces.Other algorithms applicable to the continuous action space, such as the DPG(Deterministic Policy Gradient),TD3 ( Delay DDPG),compared to DDPG, the DPG algorithm usually uses Monte Carlo estimated action value functions when updating policies, which may result in large update variances and affect the convergence and stability of the algorithm. TD3 uses two Q-networks to reduce overestimation problems, but managing the training and updating of the two Q-networks also increases the complexity and computational cost of the algorithm.Therefore, considering the advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms, we chose DDPG.Therefore, the action is set to a continuous value of 0-1. The reasons for our adoption of DDPG are explained in detail in subsection 5.1.</p>

Unlike DQN, DDPG has a stronger problem-solving ability<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.It solves the problem of actors criticizing the correlation between neural networks before and after parameter updates, note that DQN cannot be used for continuous actions, but DDPG can be used to solve reinforcement learning problems in the continuous state space and continuous action space. Considering that the state and action spaces are continuous in our discussed scenarios about the vehicular communications and computing, DDPG is a promising selection, thus we adopt DDPG in this work.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">For the traditional AFL, once a vehicle finishes training its local model, it transfers local model to the RSU for the purpose of updating global model. Then the vehicle obtains the global model for the purpose of training local model again. However, the local trainging delay and transmission delay may be large for the vehicle, thus when the vehicle is training or uploading its local model, other vehicles may have uploaded their local models to the RSU. In this case, the RSU would use other vehicles’ local models to update the global model. In addition, the local model maybe stale because of the considerable latency in local training and transmission.

When attacking a user’s vehicle, both the user’s local data and data labels may be tampered with. The former is called data flip in our simulation, while the latter is called class flip. Once a vehicle is attacked, they will incur significant losses during local AFL training. Moreover, Byzantine attacks will affect the accuracy of the global model after uploading to the global model, which in turn will affect the accuracy of all vehicles covered by the global model.

In the part of vehicle selection based on DDPG, we set one bad vehicle. Specifically, it has less information, lower computational capabilities. In addition, the local model provided will be affected by noise.
Since we only considered the Byzantine attack for already selected vehicles, the Byzantine attack has not been considered in the vehicle selection based on DDPG.
After vehicles are selected based on DDPG algorithm, two of the selected vehicles will be affected by Byzantine attack.
We set up two different classes of Byzantine attacks.

It is shown that the loss of our scheme keeps decreasing and finally becomes stable.This is because using the DDPG algorithm to select vehicles will avoid selecting those bad nodes to participate in AFL. On the contrary, the two federated learning algorithms that do not use DDPG will inevitably choose bad nodes when selecting vehicles. This is the reason why the loss of traditional AFL and traditional FL fluctuates sharply, which indicates that we have effectively screened out bad nodes.</p>

From the figure it can be seen that our proposed scheme has the lowest loss and outperforms two other baseline algorithms.

The local training time is affected by the available computing resources and data volume of the vehicle, while the communication time is also the model upload delay, which is affected by channel conditions and vehicle mobility.
According to the figure, we can find that ignoring either of these two will lead to an increase in the overall loss of the scheme. This is because a long local training time can cause the vehicle model to upload too slowly, resulting in outdated information.</p>

As shown in the chart, we can know that both methods’ precision increase as steps’ number raises. This is because when more and more local models are received at RSU in different steps, the number of global model updates keeps increasing, improving global model’s precision.
Simultaneously, it can be seen that our scheme has a higher accuracy and is more stable while the scheme without considering Byzantine attacks has a lower accuracy. This is because our scheme takes into account the factor of Byzantine attacks. As our complete scheme filters out vehicles that have been attacked by Byzantine attacks before AFL, the accuracy of the global model will not be affected by Byzantine attacks. However, once our scheme eliminates the threshold filtering process, it will cause the local model that has been attacked to be updated by the global model, which affects the accuracy of the global model. Numerically, although our model accuracy is high, it is not very obvious. This is because we did not set a large number of attacked vehicles in this experiment, so the impact is not significant. The impact on the number of attacked vehicles will be shown in the following experiments. In addition, it can be seen that different attacks have different impacts on global model’s precision. The accuracy of models subjected to class flip attacks is generally lower than those subjected to data attacks, as the impact of class flip in the dataset is greater than that of data flip.</p>

From the figure it can be seen that the loss of both schemes decrease as the number of steps increases. However, the consequences of class reversal attacks are more severe, with significant fluctuations in losses and relatively small decreases during iterations. This is because class reversal destroys the labels of the dataset, leading to more severe confusion in the dataset. Meanwhile, our approach exhibits a less loss compared to the method without considering Byzantine attacks, due to the fact that our plan takes into account Byzantine attacks and eliminates the involvement of attacked vehicles in AFL in advance, which results in lower losses and a steady decrease.</p>

It can be seen that the test error rate of our scheme is always lower than that of the scheme without considering Byzantine attacks with the increase of percentage of vehicles being affected by Byzantine attack. Meanwhile, as the percentage of vehicles affected by Byzantine attacks increases, the test error rate of the scheme without considering Byzantine attacks will rapidly increase. This is because our scheme identify and exclude vehicles affected by Byzantine attacks in advance, so that they would not affect the global model. Therefore, increasing the number of vehicles affected by Byzantine attacks almost does not affect the accuracy and error rate of the global model. For the scheme that has not considered Byzantine attacks, the error rate of the global model is acceptable when the percentage of attacked vehicles is small. However, once the percentage of attacked vehicles is large, the error rate will rapidly increase. This is because when the percentage is small, most of the data is normal, and the degree of model impact is small. However, once the percentage of attacked vehicles is large, it will cause the parameters of the model to be rapidly affected, resulting in a rapid increase in the error rate.</p>
