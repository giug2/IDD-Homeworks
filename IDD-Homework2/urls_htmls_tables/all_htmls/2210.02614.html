<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a means of distributed learning using local data stored at clients with a coordinating server. Recent studies showed that FL can suffer from poor performance and slower convergence when training data at clients are not independent and identically distributed. Here we consider a new complementary approach to mitigating this performance degradation by allowing the server to perform auxiliary learning from a small dataset. Our analysis and experiments show that this new approach can achieve significant improvements in both model accuracy and convergence time even when the server dataset is small and its distribution differs from that of the aggregated data from all clients.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a recent paradigm in which multiple clients collaborate under the coordination of a central server to train machine learning (ML) models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. A key advantage is that clients need not send their local data to any central sever or share their data with each other. Performing learning where the data is generated (or collected) is becoming necessary as a large and growing amount of data is created at the network edge and cannot all be forwarded to any central location due to many factors such as network capacity constraints, latency requirements, and data privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In its basic form, FL trains a global model for all clients based on the following high-level iterative procedure. At each global round: 1) the central server selects a subset of clients and shares the current global model with them, 2) each selected client updates the model using only its local data and forwards the updated model to the central server, and 3) the central server aggregates the updated local models from the clients to update the global model. This process is repeated until certain convergence criteria are satisfied.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Background:</span><span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold"> Conventional FL techniques, such as the well-known Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, carry out model aggregation by averaging the model parameters received from the clients. This performs well when clients have access to independent and identically distributed (IID) training samples. In practice, however, the local data available to the clients often do not satisfy this IID assumption for different reasons. For instance, clients may collect data from different sources, using different tools, under different conditions, or only have access to partial or biased data, which can cause the distributions of the samples or features at different clients to differ considerably. Such divergences are also referred to as <span id="S1.p3.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">drifts</span> or <span id="S1.p3.1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">shifts</span>, and can take different forms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</span></p>

For example, feature divergence, where the distributions of features differ at different clients, may cause local models to focus on different features or even use different feature representations. Non-IID training data can also cause clients to optimize their local models toward local optima that can differ significantly from global optima. This can further cause the weights of clients’ local models to diverge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. As a result, simply averaging local models may not move the aggregated model toward a global optimum.</span></p>

In practice, however, the server can and often have access to some training data. For example, the server may receive data from sensors and testing devices that do not participate in the learning process. It may have synthetic data obtained from simulation (or emulation) and digital twins. The server may also receive some raw data directly from the clients; this is often required to, for example, support system monitoring and diagnosis.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Consider again AVs, as an example, which need ML models to recognize objects. Today, two main sources of data are used to train and test such models. First, test vehicles are used to scout selected areas to collect real-world data. Note that this typically imposes no privacy concerns. It, however, may require large fleets of test vehicles, take years to accomplish, incur heavy costs, and yet still fail to collect enough data to cover the vast range of possible learning needs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the AV industry is increasingly relying on a second source of data – synthetic data, typically generated in the cloud – to extend model training and testing scopes.
Going forward, when some AVs participate in FL, a small fleet of test vehicles, which may not all participate in FL, can still be used to collect and send data to the server to compensate the data that the FL clients can collect.</span></p>

More importantly, it is often impractical for clients to share data with each other due to privacy concerns, network bandwidth constraints, and latency requirements. We will show that it is unnecessary to share such common datasets among clients, as comparable or better performance can be achieved by having the server learn from the same dataset.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p13.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p13.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Several recent works have considered server learning with some centralized data, e.g., hybrid training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, mixed FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, and FL with server learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> analyzes only the case where both clients’ data and server data are IID and their algorithm requires all clients to participate in every round. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> assumes IID client data and considers server’s role as a regularizer. In contrast, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> focuses on FL with non-IID client data. In this paper, we build upon our work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to study the idea of using server learning to enhance FL on non-IID data and provide both analytical and experimental results showing that this approach can be effective under certain conditions.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_normal">We considered a new approach to mitigate the performance degradation of FL on non-IID data. Our approach augments FL with server learning using a small dataset, and thus is complementary in that it can be utilized in conjunction with other existing approaches in the literature.
Our analysis and experiments revealed that FSL can offer significant improvements in terms of accuracy and convergence time over conventional FL algorithms, even when the server dataset is relatively small. As expected, the improvements depend not only on server data size but also on the divergence between its distribution and that of the aggregate training data. The improvements are higher when the distributional divergence is smaller. We are currently exploring the issue of choosing a suitable dataset for the server learning and the relationship between the performance improvements and the server data size/the distributional divergence.</span></p>
