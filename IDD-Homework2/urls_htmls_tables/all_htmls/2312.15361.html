<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">While network coverage maps continue to expand, many devices located in remote areas remain unconnected to terrestrial communication infrastructures, preventing them from getting access to the associated data-driven services. In this paper, we propose a ground-to-satellite cooperative federated learning (FL) methodology to facilitate machine learning service management over remote regions. Our methodology orchestrates satellite constellations to provide the following key functions during FL: (i) processing data offloaded from ground devices, (ii) aggregating models within device clusters, and (iii) relaying models/data to other satellites via inter-satellite links (ISLs).
Due to the limited coverage time of each satellite over a particular remote area,
we facilitate satellite transmission of trained models and acquired data to neighboring satellites via ISL, so that the incoming satellite can continue conducting FL for the region. We theoretically analyze the convergence behavior of our algorithm, and develop a training latency minimizer which optimizes over satellite-specific network resources, including the amount of data to be offloaded from ground devices to satellites and satellites’ computation speeds.
Through experiments on three datasets, we show that our methodology can significantly speed up the convergence of FL compared with terrestrial-only and other satellite baseline approaches.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Motivation: FL across remote areas.</span> Despite the wide deployment of mobile communication systems in current terrestrial networks, there still exist many isolated regions on the Earth (e.g., rural regions, maritime areas) that lack a well-developed communication infrastructure. Since neither the servers nor the access points are available/reachable in these areas, it is currently difficult to conduct FL across devices located in such regions.
Although fully decentralized FL schemes have been developed
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which remove the reliance on edge servers, these methods have limitations when connections among devices are unstable (e.g., isolated regions with distant edge devices).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To facilitate collaborative training across these disconnected devices, we take advantage of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites in FL. The explosive growth in the number of LEO satellites enables the non-terrestrial network to cover most of the regions on the Earth, enabling satellites to work as a model aggregator during FL in remote areas.
Especially when it is required to conduct FL across multiple remote clusters that are geographically separated (as in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II System Model and Overview of Approach ‣ Cooperative Federated Learning over Ground-to-Satellite Integrated Networks: Joint Local Computation and Data Offloading" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), existing FL techniques, which mostly utilize terrestrial networks, face significant challenges as the devices in different regions are not able to aggregate their models without the aid of non-terrestrial networks, e.g., satellites. Introducing satellites to FL also enables low-powered ground devices in isolated regions to benefit from the computation capabilities of satellites, due to the advancement of on-board processing technology for satellites <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Exemplary use cases.</span> Consider a scenario of training an ML model for natural disaster predictions (e.g., wildfire, hurricane, landslides). In order to reliably make decisions for these disasters, it is important to utilize data collected at IoT sensors distributed across different isolated areas, such as forests, oceans, and mountains.
Another key application could be autonomous vehicles, which necessitates collaboration among vehicles in different regions, including rural areas that lack a well-developed communication infrastructure. Other examples include hospitals, smartphones, or wearable devices located in different rural regions aiming to solve a classification task for diseases-prediction. These use cases motivate integrating terrestrial networks with the satellite network that has a wide coverage across different remote regions and sufficient computation powers for FL.</p>

The densely deployed LEO satellites enable clients located in isolated regions to receive both high-quality communication and fast computation services. Motivated by this, there has been an extensive work on satellite-assisted edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, where satellites process tasks offloaded from low-powered IoT devices. Although these works pave the way to integrate satellites in wireless networks, their focus is not on ML/FL. More recently, researchers have become interested in conducting FL using data samples directly collected at satellites <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> without consider.</p>

Despite the above mentioned works, utilization of satellites to assist FL across different remote terrestrial regions has been less explored. In this work, we aim to explore this topic, which is faced with several key challenges and research questions. First, what should be the roles of the satellites in assisting FL across remote areas? How much data should be offloaded from the ground devices to the satellites in each region for training? How should the satellite-side battery issue be handled during FL? How can we handle the limited coverage time of LEO satellites over each area? How can we guarantee convergence of a satellite-assisted FL algorithm? How should we optimize the network resources to minimize the training time? To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first attempts to address these research questions.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a ground-to-satellite cooperative FL methodology that provides a novel direction for utilizing satellites in FL. In order to facilitate efficient FL across different remote areas or clusters, we use each satellite as (i) an edge computing unit for processing data offloaded from the ground users, (ii) a server for aggregating the models within each cluster, (iii) a relay for sharing the model/data with other satellites via inter-satellite links (ISLs).</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to the traditional FL in terrestrial networks, one of the key challenges that arises in this ground-to-satellite integrated network is that the satellites are continuously moving following their orbits, limiting the coverage time of satellites for each cluster. To handle this issue, we propose to let each satellite transmit its trained model and data offloaded from the clients to its neighboring satellite (that will cover the same region in a near future) via ISL, so that the incoming satellite can continue training the model for the devices located in that region. We conduct convergence analysis of our FL algorithm, and optimize various network resources including the amount of data offloading, satellite-side computation power, and user bandwidth, to minimize the overall latency of ML model training. Another unique challenge of our setup is to deal with the satellite-side battery constraints. We consider solar-powered satellites having solar panels where the batteries could be charged via the sun. Hence, more data can be offloaded to the satellites when clusters are facing the sun, and those satellites can process data with higher computation powers with less battery issues. These aspects are integrated in our formulated network optimization problem.</p>

Most existing works on FL have been developed in a terrestrial network with a single cloud server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> or with multiple edge servers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. In these works, the role of the server is to aggregate the models sent from the clients. Research has been also conducted in a fully decentralized setup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> where the models are aggregated at individual clients, without requiring any servers. However, when clients in different remote regions need to collaboratively train an ML model without relying on terrestrial communications, these FL techniques face great challenges.</p>

The main focus of these works is to investigate where/how to aggregate the trained models after the satellite-side local updates.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> specifically study model aggregation strategies by utilizing the ground station as a server, where <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> specifically adopt ISL communications during the aggregation process.
FL has been also studied in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, where the UAVs collect data and act as clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Compared to these works where either the LEO satellites or the UAVs are viewed as clients, we focus on a different scenario where clients are located in isolated regions on the ground. Our problem setup necessitates satellites to have additional functions to process data offloaded from the ground users, to aggregate the models within the cluster, and to relay model/data to another satellite via ISL communications to continue model training for the cluster.</p>

However, their focus is not on ML/FL. The key difference between these literatures and our setup is that, we require clients to collaboratively train a shared ML model across different regions, while the clients in prior works just need to solve their own computational tasks independently. The collaborative ML task in our setup requires satellites to aggregate and relay models to theoretically guarantee the convergence of FL, making the problem totally different.</p>

This problem setup is fundamentally different from the settings in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> where each satellite directly collects its local data, presenting new research questions on what the roles of the satellites should be.
The recent magazine paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> discusses possible scenarios of utilizing satellites as edge computing servers or relays during FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, the authors specifically focus on training the deep Q network (DQN) model for
optimizing the action selection policy in the maze problem. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, the satellite is also adopted as a server to aggregate the models trained at the ground devices in wireless settings. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, the authors consider data offloading in UAV-assisted FL.
Compared to prior works, our contribution is to design a satellite-assisted FL strategy with several unique characteristics including client-to-satellite data offloading, hybrid satellite/client model training, battery charging of solar-powered LEO satellites, and model/data transmissions between incoming and departing satellites.</p>

As a preprocessing step, the resource-limited clients offload specific portions of their local datasets to the corresponding satellite as in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ II System Model and Overview of Approach ‣ Cooperative Federated Learning over Ground-to-Satellite Integrated Networks: Joint Local Computation and Data Offloading" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>.

Here, due to the limited coverage time of each satellite over each cluster, we let each satellite transmits the trained model and the collected dataset to the neighboring satellite that will cover the same cluster in the near future. As a result, the incoming satellite can continue training the model for the specific cluster. This procedure is repeated until all data samples at the satellite are processed. Then in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1.sf3" title="In Figure 1 ‣ II System Model and Overview of Approach ‣ Cooperative Federated Learning over Ground-to-Satellite Integrated Networks: Joint Local Computation and Data Offloading" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(c)</span></a>, intra-cluster model aggregation is performed to construct cluster-specific models. Finally, in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1.sf4" title="In Figure 1 ‣ II System Model and Overview of Approach ‣ Cooperative Federated Learning over Ground-to-Satellite Integrated Networks: Joint Local Computation and Data Offloading" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(d)</span></a>, a global model is constructed by aggregating the models of all clusters, which is sent back to all clients at the beginning of next global round.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct experiments using three benchmark datasets for FL: MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR-10. We train a convolutional neural network with two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers using MNIST. For FMNIST, we adopt a different model with two convolutional layers and one fully connected layer. Finally, we utilize the VGG-11 model for the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use a PyTorch framework with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti GPU to train the ML models.

For a fair comparison, we optimized the variables of all
baselines to minimize latency while satisfying the optimization constraints.
Specifically, for the terrestrial-only baseline, we optimized the user bandwidth to minimize latency, where the latency model of this scheme can be simply obtained by inserting <math id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha_{k}=0" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">α</mi><mi id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><mo id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">0</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝛼</ci><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.3">𝑘</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3">0</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p3.2.m2.1c">\alpha_{k}=0</annotation></semantics></math> to (<a href="#S5.E34" title="In V-A Latency Analysis for Satellite-Assisted FL ‣ V Network Optimization for Satellite-Assisted FL ‣ Cooperative Federated Learning over Ground-to-Satellite Integrated Networks: Joint Local Computation and Data Offloading" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">34</span></a>) for all <math id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k=1,2,\dots,K" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4a"><mrow id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.2" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.2.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.2" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.2.1" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.cmml">2</mn><mo id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.2.2" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.cmml">…</mi><mo id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.2.3" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.cmml">K</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4b"><apply id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5"><eq id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.1"></eq><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.2">𝑘</ci><list id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.5.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.1.1">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.2.2">2</cn><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.3.3">…</ci><ci id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4.cmml" xref="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4.4">𝐾</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS1.p3.3.m3.4c">k=1,2,\dots,K</annotation></semantics></math>.

We make the following key observations. First, the scheme that utilizes only the client-side computations without any data offloading to satellites, achieves the worst performance. One trivial reason is that this scheme ignores the satellite-side computation, not taking the benefit of parallel client-satellite computing. Another important factor is the non-IID data distribution across clients. Without any data offloading, the performance of this baseline becomes extremely limited under the non-IID setting due to the biased local datasets of clients. Related to this phenomenon, it can be seen that the performance gap between the IID and non-IID cases decreases as more data samples are offloaded to the satellite. The satellite-side dataset collected from different users can somewhat resolve the issue that arises from the non-IID data distribution. However, offloading too many data samples to the satellite will slow down the training process, causing latency issues. This can be confirmed by comparing the scheme that offloads all non-sensitive samples (i.e., <math id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha^{\text{max}}=0.8" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msup id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">α</mi><mtext id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3a.cmml">max</mtext></msup><mo id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">0.8</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝛼</ci><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3a.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">max</mtext></ci></apply><cn type="float" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">0.8</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\alpha^{\text{max}}=0.8</annotation></semantics></math> portion of local dataset) to the satellite, and the schemes that only offload <math id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="30\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">30</mn><mo id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">30</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">30\%</annotation></semantics></math> or <math id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="40\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">40</mn><mo id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">40</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.3.m3.1c">40\%</annotation></semantics></math> of the local datasets.

As the satellite has more battery in the beginning of training (i.e., as <math id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E^{\text{original}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><msup id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">E</mi><mtext id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3a.cmml">original</mtext></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝐸</ci><ci id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3a.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">original</mtext></ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">E^{\text{original}}</annotation></semantics></math> increases), the clients tend to offload more data as the satellites can more easily satisfy the battery constraints.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a satellite-assisted FL methodology that enables ground users in remote areas to collaboratively train an ML model, without requiring terrestrial communication infrastructures. By strategically taking advantage of satellites as edge computing units, model aggregators, and relays, the proposed methodology can speed up the FL process in ground-to-satellite integrated networks. We theoretically analyzed the convergence behavior of our approach, and optimized network resources to minimize the latency. Experimental results confirmed the advantage of the proposed idea compared to baselines, and provided insights into our network optimization solutions. We believe that our solution can provide a new direction to FL over hybrid terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, where reducing the training time based on cooperation among ground users and satellites is of paramount importance. One interesting future direction is to extend our idea to the ground-air-space three layer network, having devices/sensors on the ground, UAVs or drones in the sky, and satellites in the space.</p>
