<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">The explosive amount of data generated at the network edge makes mobile edge computing an essential technology to support real-time applications, calling for powerful data processing and analysis provided by machine learning (ML) techniques. In particular, federated edge learning (FEL) becomes prominent in securing the privacy of data owners by keeping the data locally used to train ML models. Existing studies on FEL either utilize in-process optimization or remove unqualified participants in advance.
In this paper, we enhance the collaboration from all edge devices in FEL to guarantee that the ML model is trained using all available local data to accelerate the learning process. To that aim, we propose a <span id="id9.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">collective extortion (CE)</span> strategy under the imperfect-information multi-player FEL game, which is proved to be effective in helping the server efficiently elicit the full contribution of all devices without worrying about suffering from any economic loss. Technically, our proposed CE strategy extends the classical extortion strategy in controlling the proportionate share of expected utilities for a single opponent to the swiftly homogeneous control over a group of players, which further presents an attractive trait of being impartial for all participants.
Moreover, the CE strategy enriches the game theory hierarchy, facilitating a wider application scope of the extortion strategy. Both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness and fairness of our proposed scheme.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The ubiquitous deployment of Internet-connected mobile devices leads to the amount of data generated at the network edge increasing exponentially, fostering the transformative computing paradigm, namely mobile edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. According to a recent report, the global market of edge computing is $3.6 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $15.7 billion by 2025 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Facilitated by faster networking technologies such as 5G, edge computing becomes promising to support real-time applications, which calls for vigorous data processing and analysis capability at the edge.
Thanks to the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, edge computing becomes more intelligent via implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve various functions such as classification and prediction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, since the data generated at the edge devices may be highly sensitive to the end users, it might be inappropriate to deploy conventional centralized ML algorithms which need to physically collect all training data from the devices. Federated learning (FL), a representative of distributed ML, turns into the aptest for edge computing, based on which the edge server and all connected devices accomplish training the same ML model in a collaborative manner, and thus this paradigm is also termed <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</em> (FEL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. More specifically, no device explicitly uploads the generated data in FEL, but their data can still contribute to training the shared ML model by iterative local learning, global aggregating, and updating <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Within this collaboration system, the most challenging but critical issue is to guarantee that all participants cooperate tacitly. To fulfill this goal, two lines of research have been carried out, namely <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">in-process</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>

Usually, taking precautions can enhance the FEL system as a preparative, so in-advance optimization becomes more cost-efficient than checking for the leaks during the working process. The state-of-the-art accomplishes this objective via either <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">device selection</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which directly filters out unqualified devices, or <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">incentive mechanism design</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, which relies on a strong assumption of perfect information in the Stackelberg game <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, in practice, we may not have enough devices that can afford the elimination, and the devices may not own the full knowledge about each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider that an edge server and multiple devices collaborate in an FEL process repeatedly to optimize user experience in the long run. The server is the coordinator in charge of the whole FL process while the devices contribute their local learning results to obtain the globally trained model as a compensation at the end of each FL round<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>We term the “round” in this paper as finishing a specific FL task and obtaining a well-trained ML model, instead of one time of local training in FL or an epoch in the traditional ML model training phase.</span></span></span>. Within the whole FL process, the local training is only visible to and manageable by individual devices, leaving the room for selfish behaviors of perfunctorily contributing to the FEL via training the ML model using partial local datasets. To suppress this phenomenon, we utilize the multi-player simultaneous game to model the interactions between the edge server and devices in an FEL system, where none of them has perfect information about others, and aim at eliciting the full contribution of devices from the perspective of the server, instead of intolerantly eliminating malicious devices. However, the tight coupling of action and utility in this game makes it a dilemma for the server to play against devices because recklessly changing behaviors can lead to the server a decreasing utility. This brings us a question: <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">is it possible for the server to entice full contributions from the devices without concerning about its utility loss?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To answer this question, we resort to the extortion scheme which was first introduced as a special form of the zero-determinant (ZD) strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. By employing the extortion strategy, any player can independently control the proportion between the expected utility of itself and that of the opponent, which implies the potential to help the server control the utility in playing against devices. Nonetheless, the classical extortion strategy is derived for the two-player game, which is not applicable to our problem involving multiple players. In addition, it is clearly not efficient to directly carry it out between the server and every device in a one-by-one manner. To address this challenge, we put forward a <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">collective extortion (CE)</span> strategy, which can achieve the goal of effortlessly controlling the overall utility of all devices with only one-time setting for the server. What’s important, we comprehensively analyze the potential of the proposed CE strategy on enforcing the full cooperation of the devices, and further validate that it works impartially for all players with respect to utilities.</p>

Leveraging on the over-the-air computation, several studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> achieved more efficient FL aggregation by taking advantage of the superposition of signals in the wireless multiple access channel.
Tran <span id="S2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> considered the trade-off between computation and communication latency and that between learning time and energy consumption in FL for wireless networks via solving a non-convex optimization problem.
To deal with the straggler concern in FEL, a framework named ELFISH was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to achieve resource-aware learning via dynamically masking computation-intensive neurons, while Prakash <span id="S2.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> designed CodedFedL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> based on coded computing to inject structured redundancy in FL to compensate the negative impacts of straggling updates.
On the other hand, aiming to facilitate the FEL from the perspective of communications, optimal resource allocation was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and various transmission scheduling policies were designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, to achieve the best learning result, a novel protocol was devised to select qualified devices according to their computational resource and communication conditions. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, Kang <span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed a reputation based mechanism for screening out reliable devices to obtain high-quality model updates in FEL using the contract theory.
To facilitate vehicular edge learning, selectively collecting good local model updates was considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> using the two-dimension contract theory.
Besides, Zhan <span id="S2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> designed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based incentive mechanisms for edge-based FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, where the optimal pricing strategy of the aggregator and the best contribution strategy of the participants can be derived based on the hierarchical Stackelberg game. While Pandey <span id="S2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> solved the incentive problem in FL with communication efficiency consideration using a crowdsourcing framework and the two-stage Stackelberg game for equilibrium analysis,
Le <span id="S2.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> studied the incentive mechanism design for FL in wireless scenario via an auction game.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Relying on the power of taking precautions in enhancing the FEL performance, one can find that the existing studies either rigidly filter out unsatisfied devices or assume the availability of perfect information to implement, which can be impractical as there is hardly redundant number of participants or full knowledge about each other in FEL. To overcome these shortcomings, we utilize the multi-player simultaneous game to model the interactions between the edge server and devices with nobody having perfect knowledge of others, and then design an effective CE strategy to enforce the full contribution of selfish devices with fairness guaranteed.</p>

The system aims at providing better services to end users via conducting collaborative machine learning based on the data generated by all edge devices. Specifically, we assume that the FEL is conducted in a round-by-round manner, where the round is defined as <span id="S3.SS1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">accomplishing a certain learning task with the objective of training a global ML model with good performance</span>. Each device joins a round of FEL task by contributing the locally learned results obtained through training the initial ML model using the local dataset for multiple iterations. As a compensation, the server, who works as the FEL coordinator, returns the final well-trained ML model to the participating devices once the current round of FEL task finishes.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, some devices may behave selfishly by utilizing partial of his<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>We use “he” and “she” to respectively represent anyone of the devices and the server.</span></span></span> local data to conduct the local training of ML model, by which they can make extra profits, such as saving computational resources and using the rest of the data to further improve the final ML model only for themselves.
This sort of malicious behavior comes to be difficult for the server to timely detect and prevent due to the following two reasons. First, the server has no access to the local datasets held by devices for directly acquiring their size information or training efforts;
second, the data distribution of devices is usually skewed in FEL, making it impossible to infer the size information, either.
In this case, the server may behave strategically via choosing to return or not return the final ML model to the devices, thus helping suppress the selfishness in an opportunistic way, which will be detailed in the next subsection.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is clear that neither the server nor any device can know the action of each other when they make their own decisions, which can be exactly modeled by a multi-player simultaneous game. Even though it seems that there are only two types of players, i.e., the edge server and the device, the number of players involved in the decision making and outcome witnessing of this game is multiple. In particular, the number of devices playing against the server in this FEL scenario can be large, and every device has his own preference on game strategy selection and operates with independent system parameters related to their benefits and costs.</p>

This is obviously harmful for the overall benefit of the FEL system where the global model cannot be trained based on all generated data, leading to the reduced model performance. Thus, it becomes critical to solve this all-defection dilemma.
Here we consider that the server is in charge of driving the cooperation from the devices due to the following two reasons. First, as the upper-level controller of the FEL system, the server hopes to obtain an optimal collaborative learning result, which becomes the motivation for her to get rid of this undesired situation; second, as the coordinator, the server can exert punishment to defective devices via not returning the final model, which indicates her capability to suppress malice.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To elicit full contributions from the devices, one intuitive solution for the server is to design cooperation incentive schemes, which usually costs more for the server to entice profit-driven devices. Thus, it is imperative to design a new scheme embedded in this multi-player game process while preventing any interest loss for the server.

making it a critical challenge for the server to <span id="S3.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">manage the behaviors of the devices without concerning her own utility.</span>
Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, we find that the extortion mechanism, as a type of the zero-determinant (ZD) strategy, presents the merit of enabling the adopter to unilaterally control a proportional relationship between the expected utilities of two players, which implies the potential of helping solve the server’s challenge.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the conventional extortion strategy was originally developed for the two-player game, which is not directly applicable to our problem. Although one possible application idea is to carry it out between the server and each device, we can clearly notice the low efficiency of this one-by-one method.
Thus, we resort to extending the extortion strategy to the multi-player scenario and name it as the <span id="S3.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">collective extortion (CE) strategy</span>, which will be elaborated in the next section.</p>

To that aim, we first assume that each device in the FEL game searches for the best response strategy in an <span id="S5.SS2.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">evolutionary</span> manner. The reason is that the device lacks the global game information compared to the server who can interact with all devices in the game. Here we assume that a device adjusts his strategy with the goal of improving his own utility regardless of the strategy or utility of the server.

The first two strategies are easy to understand where the server stays constantly cooperative or defective. The TFT strategy means that the server behaves according to the device’s previous action while in WSLS the server keeps on choosing an action if it brings a high utility and switches to the other action otherwise.</p>

This clearly demonstrates the fairness of the CE strategy in incentivizing the full cooperation of all devices. For other cases, one can find that the ALLC strategy makes the server suffer from a severe loss since the evolutionary device can strategically exploit her friendliness and behave defectively to obtain a higher utility. The ALLD and TFT strategies lead to similar results for them where the server gains slightly less than the device. This is because the server cannot be fully exploited with ALLD and TFT strategies but the device in these cases will not be driven to cooperate, and thus both of them obtain less profit compared to the situation where the server adopts the CE strategy. The WSLS strategy also makes the server acquire less but performs better than the case of ALLC.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimizing the FEL system performance via eliminating the selfish device behaviors. Specifically, we model the interactions between the edge server and the devices as a multi-player simultaneous game, based on which we derive a CE strategy to collectively control the proportional relationship between the utility of the server and that of the devices. Based on this CE strategy,
the server can efficiently enforce full contribution of all devices without concerning about her utility, which is both theoretically analyzed and experimentally evaluated. Essentially, the proposed CE strategy is impartial for both the adopter and the opponents, indicating its liveness to maintain the stability of the FEL systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, we plan to examine the efficiency and scalability of the proposed game-theoretic scheme in playing against selfish devices in FEL.
Besides, we will explore more intelligent solutions about countering other malicious behaviors of devices in FEL, where dynamically joining and leaving the learning process will be discussed to describe more realistic scenarios.</p>
