<p class="ltx_p" id="id6.id1">Recommender systems underpin many of the personalized services in the online information &amp; social media ecosystem. However, the assumptions in the research on content recommendations in domains like search, video, and music are often applied wholesale to domains that require a better understanding of why and how users interact with the systems. In this position paper we focus on social media and argue that personalized timelines have an added layer of complexity that is derived from the social nature of the platform itself. In particular, definitions of exposure fairness should be expanded to consider the social environment each user is situated in: how often a user is exposed to others is as important as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id6.id1.1">who</span> they get exposed to.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Solving for fairness in recommender systems is a difficult problem with multiple types of stakeholders, e.g., consumers, producers, and advertisers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ekstrand et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib11" title="">2022</a>)</cite>. As with other algorithmic systems, there has been acknowledgement of harms from recommender systems, both allocative and representative <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Barocas et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib5" title="">2017</a>)</cite>. Many concerns around algorithmic harms stem from the fact that we measure performance of recommender systems by aggregating over the score of each user’s individual recommendations rather than a top-down view of the behavior of the system. These measures of bias and harm are useful for informing better recommender system design, but a common theme in these analyses is a tacit abstraction of the domain that the system is situated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ekstrand and Pera, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib12" title="">2022</a>; Ekstrand et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib11" title="">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">Take for instance popularity bias: the observation that popularity bias in music recommendations can yield material differences in revenue across artists is useful for mitigating those harms in the music recommendation domain and only marginally useful for other domains of recommendations. Popularity bias in social media personalized timelines can also have material consequences for content creators in terms of revenue, however the social context of the recommendations means that a user’s engagement with content is also dependent on other factors. These factors include one’s own beliefs or ideological alignment to the content; how one perceives the norms about engaging with the content; one’s perceived alignment with the user sharing the content; finally, any considerations the individual has for their “imagined audiences” and how they might be perceived for engaging with the content<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Marwick and Boyd, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib19" title="">2011</a>)</cite>. These factors may be present in other kinds of recommendation domains, however the extent to which they are present depends on the structure and affordances of the platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">Another aspect of this is how to enforce constraints about allocative harms like exposure fairness in recommender systems. Extensive work has been done to address these concerns, however they tacitly assume the inventory of items is universally accessible to each user, and also do not consider systems that rely on user-generated content (i.e., where consumers are also producers)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib23" title="">2022</a>; Diaz et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib10" title="">2020</a>; Burke et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib9" title="">2018</a>; Abdollahpouri and Mansoury, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib2" title="">2020</a>)</cite>. Given the network structure underpinning social media platforms, who one user is connected to will have substantial influence on the content they are exposed to. In order to enforce constraints about exposure in social media recommender systems, it is important for such measures of fairness to be designed with users’ perceptions, possible cognitive biases and their interactions with other users (not to mention the system itself) in mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">Given the above caveats, in this position paper we build upon previous arguments that metrics and fairness strategies should be adapted to the domain they are situated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ekstrand and Pera, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib12" title="">2022</a>)</cite>. We discuss the social media personalized timeline context specifically, the social and cognitive factors impacting perception, and what exposure bias entails. We then present a toy example of exposure bias and suggest a means for mitigation.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2. </span>Social sensing &amp; cognitive biases</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p1.1">First we consider the users’ perceptions and biases. Human beings are fundamentally social creatures, and it has been shown that we have the capacity to observe our social networks and make inferences about the mental states of others. This capacity for social sensing is susceptible however to cognitive biases: Galesic, Olsson and Rieskamp 2012 describe a model where individuals estimate large scale statistics like average household wealth by using information from their immediate social network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Galesic et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib13" title="">2012</a>)</cite>. In this they found individuals surveyed tended to be more accurate when making estimates about their immediate network, but were much less accurate when making estimates about broader populations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p2.1">We refer to the cognitive sciences to identify relevant socio-cognitive biases. A primary bias is the salience bias: humans tend to pay more attention to unexpected or irregular stimuli <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kardosh et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib15" title="">2022</a>)</cite>. This bias can manifest in identifying minority groups as standing out, often resulting in an overestimation of their size. This is similar to the structural phenomena in networks in which network structure distorts a user’s local perception of the whole network, e.g., the majority illusion and the friendship paradox<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lerman et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib17" title="">2016</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p3.1">The individual’s own prior beliefs can influence their social perception as well through the false uniqueness (i.e., underestimating the prevalence of one’s views) and false consensus effects (i.e., overestimating the prevalence of one’s views). Empirical evidence suggests that Americans with more conservative views on climate change, as well as those with more conservative local norms and exposure to conservative news underestimate support for climate change policies by as much as half <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sparkman et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib22" title="">2022</a>)</cite>.

<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p1.1">As a minority/majority dichotomy in a social network can reflect a wide range of factors from demographic factors like gender, ethnicity and age to differences in opinion on arbitrary matters, we consider <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.p1.1.1">exposure bias</span> to be a systematic distortion in content visibility and perceived prevalence within a social network. This distortion arises from discrepancies between the “potential network” (active social connections, e.g., who follows who), the “activated network” (the users who engage in content creation or activity and thus can be observed by other users), and the feed-exposed network (the network users actually observe and interact with). The feed-exposed networks, mediated by specific recommender systems, can modulate this bias leading to certain content being either over- or under-represented, which skews its perceived prevalence relative to its actual prevalence. In a sense, minimizing this bias can be seen as enforcing statistical parity in exposure across users in the “global” network<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mehrabi et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib20" title="">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p2.1">There are multiple ways one may measure exposure bias– previous studies have used the Gini coefficient and local perception bias as introduced in Alipourfard et al., 2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bartley et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib6" title="">2023</a>; Alipourfard et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib4" title="">2020</a>)</cite>. These measures can be adjusted to take exposure into consideration, allowing us to compare exposure under different personalized timelines. As described in previous works, it is essential to consider multiple metrics as they complement each other in interpreting their results<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mansoury et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib18" title="">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p3.1">An important note in enforcing any measure of exposure fairness is that it may work well in aggregate, however depending on what “global” represents there may be subsets of users with vastly different experiences of their network. To better understand the heterogeneous experiences users may have of their network, we should consider how users interact with each other and with the platform itself.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">Three interpersonal user dynamics have been described in these online “networked publics” that should be considered when building personalized timelines: 1) unless explicitly constrained to friends and followers, users have invisible audiences to their content that may scale in size beyond their control; 2) the different contexts in which content is observed are collapsed (e.g., the designated audience may perceive a joke to be appropriate but others may perceive the same content to be inappropriate); and 3) similar to the first point, content and conversations assuming more private environments may be thrust into more public environments with unintended consequences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Boyd, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib7" title="">2009</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p2.1">These considerations suggest that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p2.1.1">who</span> shows up on your timeline and the social context in which their post is presented can shape users’ experiences of the platform. As a practical example, Instagram researchers have suggested that they filter out some rare user IDs from users’ feeds as they have found too many rare users can impact users’ satisfaction / utility with the system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bredillet, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib8" title="">2023</a>)</cite>. The measurements of user utility and relevance, tied into an optimization that rewards engagement, may inadvertently optimize a user’s feed for niche tastes and specific behaviors. For instance, Jiang et al., 2023 suggests that toxic behavior on platforms like X/Twitter may be reinforced by social approval and the propensity to act in a toxic behavior in their network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jiang et al<span class="ltx_text">.</span>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib14" title="">2023</a>)</cite>. If we are not careful about user dynamics when enforcing fairness we may end up optimizing negative engagement between users or facilitating second-order effects like fewer professional connections for marginalized users<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Akpinar and Fazelpour, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13237v1#bib.bib3" title="">2024</a>)</cite>.</p>

Toy example &amp; Practical Considerations ‣ RTs ≠ Endorsements: Rethinking Exposure Fairness on Social Media Platforms"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. In this example users are subjected to two different kinds of timelines with limited slots (i.e., each user only observes their timeline for a fixed amount of posts). One can imagine that in aggregate both feeds show each users’ posts in a manner that maintains a particular measure of exposure fairness (e.g., the probability of observing a post from a user with the minority trait is proportional to their prevalence in expectation). The problem arises with the network: each user within that network will observe a different prevalence of the trait, and as such may have a different perception of whether or not the system is actually providing fairness in exposure. If the user highlighted in the figure is only exposed to blue users, then this may have consequences on how the user perceives the network as a whole.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">In this paper we argue that to make adequate and exposure-fair recommendations in social media the platforms need to consider the perceived social environment the system is putting the user into. We suggest an operationalization of exposure bias that considers how a recommender system can modulate a user’s perception of their social environment. We also suggest a potential method for minimizing such exposure bias.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p2.1">Of course, to some degree the user has agency in what and who they choose to interact with, however the platform decides how users can interact with it through design choices and affordances of the platform suggesting they have more liability in how they shape users’ experiences. In order to adequately understand exposure fairness on these platforms, we must connect it more to each users’ view of their online surroundings.</p>
