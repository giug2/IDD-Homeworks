<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Name matching is a key component of systems for entity resolution or record linkage. Alternative spellings of the same names are a common occurrence in many applications. We use the largest collection of genealogy person records in the world together with user search query logs to build name matching models. The procedure for building a crowd-sourced training set is outlined together with the presentation of our method.
We cast the problem of learning alternative spellings as a machine translation problem at the character level. We use information retrieval evaluation methodology to show that this method substantially outperforms on our data a number of standard well known phonetic and string similarity methods in terms of precision and recall. Additionally, we rigorously compare the performance of standard methods when compared with each other. Our result can lead to a significant practical impact in entity resolution applications.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A person’s name, especially the family name, is the key field used in identifying person’s records in databases. Software tools and applications designed for entity resolution of a person’s records usually rely on the person’s name as a primary identification field. In particular, genealogy services provide user access to a person’s record databases and facilitate search for a user’s ancestors/relatives and other person/records of interest. A persons’s records indicate some type of a life event including birth, death, marriage or relocation. Typically, records are indexed by some unique identifier and can also be searched by a combination of last/first names, geographical locations and event dates.
Searching a record database is complicated by the user not knowing the exact spelling of the name in the record they are searching for. This task becomes even harder since databases often contain alternate spellings referring to the same person. This transpires due to many factors including optical character recognition errors when scanning the records, errors/misspelling of names in the records themselves, and name transliterations. For instance a common last name “Shepard” has been also commonly spelled as “Shepherd”, “Sheppard”, “Shephard”, “Shepperd”, “Sheperd”. Clearly, having methods that would provide users and the search engines with a list of highly credible misspelling of the query name would significantly improve the search results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Knowing how to misspell names to find records of interest has always been a part of a professional genealogist’s domain expertise. In this paper we try to bridge this gap and bring this power to the average user by employing data-driven methods that rely on our unique data set<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Data is available for research purposes from the authors</span></span></span>. Through Ancestry.com we have access to the world’s largest genealogy data repository. The main function of a genealogy service is to facilitate discovery of relevant person’s records and the construction of family trees. Tree construction involves user attaching relevant scanned/digitized records, found in Ancestry.com databases, to user-generated tree node. Having records attached to individual tree nodes affords us an opportunity to collect misspellings of names. By leveraging user-provided links between individual user family tree nodes and scanned attached records, we generated a "labeled" dataset of name pairs where the left side of each pair comes from user supplied person names and the right part of the pair comes from the attached record name field. All user-identifying information except for last name pairs is discarded from the final dataset. We filter and pre-process this list of name pairs and use it to train a model using standard machine translation methods. We will go into more details on data pre-processing in Section 5. Additionally, we generated another dataset from company search logs. Often, users modify a previous search query in hope of getting better results. These user-driven modifications are called query reformulations. By identifying logged-in user sessions and extracting names from user queries in sequential order from the same session in a specified time interval and using our assumption that users frequently search for variations of the same name we have been able to accumulate a large number of name pairs that could also be used as a training/testing data for our models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As a result of our experiments we produce ranked candidate variant spellings for each query name. In addition to providing the translation model we also propose a methodology, adapted from the information retrieval community, for evaluating of the final candidate list and for comparing it with other methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the results section we will show that our methods perform significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall in identifying a quality lists of alternative name spellings.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The remainder of the paper is organized as following. In section 2 we discuss the numerous previous works in related fields. A detailed description of our training data is given in Section 3. In Section 4 we outline the machine translation method used in training our model. We then discuss our results and present comparisons with other methods in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Previous work </h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The classic reference in the field of record linkage is a paper by Fellegi and Sunter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> published in 1969.
In their work the authors have carefully presented the theory of record matching. They defined the terms of positive disposition (link and non-link) and negative disposition (possible link) and showed that the optimal record matching linkage rule would minimize the possibility of failing to make a positive disposition for fixed levels of errors.
Since this seminal work there has been proliferation of work in this area. In the interest of brevity we direct the reader to the outstanding 2006 survey paper by Winkler <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and to the comprehensive work by Christen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> published just recently.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the explosive growth of data coming from web applications it is becoming imperative to discover the best methods for record matching in terms of accuracy and speed. Historically, methods focusing on name matching could be separated into two classes: sequential character methods and bag-of-words methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<section id="S2.SS1" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Sequential Character methods</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Phonetic similarity methods are an important category of sequential character methods.
The key concept of phonetic methods is to map n-grams of characters into phonetic equivalents. The output of using these methods on string pairs is a binary decision and not a degree of similarity. The best-known method from this class is Soundex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Over the years a numerous improvements of this approach have been made. In particular some of them had to do with accommodating non-English names. Popular methods include Soundex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, Double Metaphon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and NYSIIS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. While these methods proved to be useful in improving performance in data matching applications they do not solve the problem of relevance ranking of alternative spellings, which is of great importance for search engines when considering using alternative name spellings for query expansion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.6" class="ltx_p">Another important category of sequential character methods often used in conjunction with phonetic methods is the class of static string similarity measures.
Similarity method based on edit distance (the Levenshtein distance, as it is also known <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>) is the most well-known method of this type. The edit distance between strings <math id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">s</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑠</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">s</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S2.SS1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p2.2.m2.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> is the cost of the optimal shortest sequence of edit operations (substitute, add, delete) that converts <math id="S2.SS1.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p2.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">s</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p2.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p2.3.m3.1.1">𝑠</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p2.3.m3.1c">s</annotation></semantics></math> to <math id="S2.SS1.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p2.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p2.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p2.4.m4.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p2.4.m4.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>. For instance, the mapping of <math id="S2.SS1.p2.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p2.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p2.5.m5.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml">s</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p2.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p2.5.m5.1.1">𝑠</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p2.5.m5.1c">s</annotation></semantics></math> = ”Johnson” to <math id="S2.SS1.p2.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p2.6.m6.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p2.6.m6.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p2.6.m6.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p2.6.m6.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p2.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p2.6.m6.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p2.6.m6.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> = ”Johnston” results in one addition of letter "t" and hence, results in a distance of one.
Other common similarity measures include the Jaro <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> method which takes into account the number
and order of common characters between two strings and the Jaro-Winkler <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> method which extends Jaro by accounting for the common prefixes in both strings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
The static similarity measures described above, while useful in measuring similarity and ranking alternative spellings, are not capable of generating alternative spellings. This capability is typically absent from all methods that do not take a dataset’s statistical information into account.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In 2013 Bradford <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> published a paper dealing with alternative name spelling generation. He used latent semantic indexing that uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method to identify patterns in the relationships between the terms in unstructured collection of texts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Because of the difficulty associated with obtaining the experimental data many researchers
build their own synthetic datasets by utilizing specialized tools for mining the web and extracting words that appear to be last names. The resulting names are used in forming artificial pairs using one or more similarity measures (typically based on edit distance). Another popular alternative is to hire human annotators who create last name pairs based on their knowledge of name misspelling. Both of these methods may introduce bias.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our data is being produced by millions of users who act as human annotators and who should be experts in their own genealogy and are motivated to build quality content. Due to the nature of our dataset we can extract best pairs using frequency statistics. We will go into more detail about our filtering process later in this paper.
Having frequency information allows us to assemble realistic distribution of name pairs and helps in training more accurate models of alternative name spellings.</p>

<section id="S2.SS2" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Bag-of-words methods</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Bag-of-words methods typically represent strings as a set of words or word n-grams. There were numerous studies published on the topic of applying bags of words to record linkage over the last decade <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Cosine similarity of term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) weighted vectors is one of the most popular methods of this type. Typical vectors consist of individual words or n-grams. The main shortcoming of cosine similarity TFIDF is that this method requires exact matches between fields. To alleviate this issue cosine similarity SoftTFIDF was introduced by Cohen et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In addition to counting identical fields occurring in both vectors SoftTFIDF compares and keeps track of "similar" fields in both vectors. Bilenko et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> showed how machine learning methods could be successfully employed for learning the combined field similarity. They trained an SVM classifier using feature vectors, and then applied the learned classifier’s confidence in the match as a class score.
In this paper we do not consider these approaches because we primarily work with single word last names and bag-of-words methods are more suited for finding similarity between multi-field records.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.3 </span>Spelling correction and Machine Translation literature</h3>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the 1990 Kernighan et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> in their short paper proposed a method for spelling corrections based on noisy channels. The same formulation would latter be used in machine translation field. The basic idea was to find best possible correction by optimizing the product of language model ( a prior probability of letters/phrases/words in a given language) and correction model (likelihood of one word being spelled as another).
For comprehensive survey of spelling correction methods the reader should look at the
excellent chapter on this topic at Jurafsky and Martin 2008 Speech and Language Processing book. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the last several decades machine translation methods have gained significant traction and recently found their way into the problem of name matching. In 2007 Bhagat et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> implemented a transducer based method for finding alternative name spellings by employing a graphemes-to-phonemes framework. Their method involved running EM (expectation maximization) algorithm, first presented by Dempster <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, to align text from the CMU dictionary with their phoneme sequence equivalents.
Next, they built a character language model of phoneme trigrams using the same CMU dictionary phonemes. Their training set was mined from the web.
Using both-ways translation models and language models, the authors were able to generate alternative phoneme sequences (pronunciations), given a character string name, and then each of these sequences was converted into an alternative character sequence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In 1996 Ristad and Yianilos <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> presented an interesting solution where they learned the cost of edit distance operations, which are normally all set to one in static edit distance algorithms. The authors used expectation maximization algorithm for training. Their model resulted in the form a transducer.
Bilenko et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> improved on Ristad and Yianilos’s learned edit distance model by including affine gaps. They also presented a learned string
similarity measure based on unordered bags of words, using SVM for training.
McCallum et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> in 2005 approached the same problem from the different angle. Instead of using generative models like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> they have used discriminative method, conditional random fields (CRF), where they have been able to use both positive and negative string pairs for training.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Ancestry.com has over the years accumulated over 11 billion records and over 40 million personal family trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Most of the records in the Ancestry.com database originate from the Western European countries, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Scanned collections of census data, and personal public and private documents uploaded by company users comprise the bulk of Ancestry.com datasets.
One of the key features of the Ancestry.com web site is the facility for building personal family trees with an option for searching and attaching relevant documents from record databases to the relevant parts of family trees. For example if a family tree contains a node for a person with the name John Smith it would be often accompanied by the birth record, relocation record, marriage record and other records discovered by the owner of the family tree. Since most of the nodes in the deep family trees involve persons who are no longer living, death records can often be discovered and attached to the appropriate nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This linkage between user-specified family tree nodes and the official records present us with a unique opportunity to assemble a parallel corpus of pairs of names, hand-labeled by the users themselves. In the past researchers working on name matching problem were forced to assemble their training datasets by employing text mining techniques. Very often a specific method was needed for identifying names in a given text and then edit distance measure was used to find a list of misspelling candidates. Additionally, in some studies, a small number of dedicated human labelers provided additional level of confidence. These methods would inevitably lead to bias. We believe that our user-labeled dataset contains significantly less bias than previously used training datasets.</p>

<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the availability of the “labeled” dataset in the Ancestry.com we have a more direct way of generating training data. From the begininning we realized that we could not employ standard supervised machine learning methods for finding alternative name spellings since that would require us to collect positive and negative training sets. While it would have been possible to mine positive sets from user-labeled data, defining the process generating realistic negative examples is ambiguous at best. This would require us finding name pairs that would not be alternative spellings of each other with a high degree of confidence. Even through it may seem doable at first glance this a very tricky proposition. First of all how would we choose each pair item? What is the distribution of negative pairs? We only have user labels for positive pairs, but not having user label for a name pair does not necessarily mean that the pair is negative. Not having any other alternatives we would have to bias our negative set to some kind of similarity measure like the Levenshtein method and this would force us to arbitrary select a threshold that would distinguish negative pairs from positive pairs. However, besides introducing bias this method would make us miss numerous negative pairs which would have high similarity values but would not constitute a positive common misspellings.
Due to having this obstacle in front of us, we turned toward machine translation methods because only a parallel corpus was needed to train the translation model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Given the way Ancestry.com users interact with the genealogy service, we isolated two separate ways of collecting parallel corpus data that would later be used for training translation models and for testing. We felt that having two completely different underlying processes for generating our datasets would strengthen our case if we arrived at similar conclussions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The first process of assembling a parallel corpus consists of collecting all directed pairs of names drawn from anonymized (striped from all user identifying information except last names) user tree nodes and their attached anonymized records. We chose pair direction as following: last names on the left come from tree nodes and last names on the right come from the records. Since last names in records and tree nodes have different distribution taking directionality into account is important when choosing the training set of pairs. A number of filtering steps have been applied in order to de-noise the datasets and will be discussed in more detail in the later sections. The pairs are directed which implies that a pair “Johansson” - “Johanson” would be different from the reverse pair “Johanson”-“Johansson”. This would manifest in separate co-occurrence count for each pair.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p6.4" class="ltx_p">The second process for building a parallel corpus involves using recorded user search queries. Since the Ancestry.com search query form asks the user for specific fields when searching for trees or records, we have been able to extract user queries containing names from a search log.
By grouping users by their loginname, sorting the queries in chronological order, and fixing the time interval at a generous <math id="S3.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="30" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">30</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1">30</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1c">30</annotation></semantics></math> minutes, we have been able to extract directed pairs of names that users use in their search queries. Our build-in assumption is that frequently users do not find what they are looking for on their first attempt and if that is the case they try again. The resulting data set is also noisy and requires extensive filtering before being used as a training set. Each pair has a direction from an older name spelling to a newer reformulation. For example if a user A searches for name “Shephard” at time <math id="S3.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t_{0}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">t</mi><mn id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">0</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.2.m2.1.1.3">0</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.2.m2.1c">t_{0}</annotation></semantics></math> and then searches for name “Shepperd” at time <math id="S3.p6.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t_{1}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">t</mi><mn id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.3.m3.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.3.m3.1c">t_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> where <math id="S3.p6.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t_{1}-t_{0}&lt;30" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml"><msub id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">t</mi><mn id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.1" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.1.cmml">−</mo><msub id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mn id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">0</mn></msub></mrow><mo id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><mn id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">30</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1"><lt id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.1"></lt><apply id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2"><minus id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.1"></minus><apply id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.2.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.2">𝑡</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.3.3">0</cn></apply></apply><cn type="integer" id="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.4.m4.1.1.3">30</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.4.m4.1c">t_{1}-t_{0}&lt;30</annotation></semantics></math> then the resulting pair will be: “Shephard” - “Shepperd” and not the other way around.</p>

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">An “alignment model” is used in generating translational correspondences between names in our context and it can be best described by an example shown on Figure <a href="#S5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 5.1 Data Preparation ‣ 5 Results ‣ Learning Alternative Name Spellings" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Here the name “Thorogood” is aligned with the name “Thoroughgood”. Looking at the Figure <a href="#S5.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 5.1 Data Preparation ‣ 5 Results ‣ Learning Alternative Name Spellings" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> we can clearly see that second occurrence of letter ’o’ in “Thorogood” alignes with two letters (’o’ and ’u’) in “Thoroughgood”, similar situation happens with the last letter ’g’ in “Thorogood” which gets aligned with 2 letters ’g’ in “Thoroughgood”. Other letters in “Thorogood” aligned 1-to-1 with letters in “Thoroughgood”. Letter ’h’ in “Thoroughgood” does not align with anything in “Thorogood”.
Estimating “alignment model” results in generation alignement rules such as the ones that we just presented.</p>

Moses is a package that contains various tools needed in translation process.
Typically, translation software deals with words in a sentence as primary tokens, since we compare individual last names we had to transform our input to a format recognizable by Moses while also maintaining characters as primary tokens. In our case single words become sentences and characters become words in the sentence.</p>

We used IRSTLM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a statistical language model tool for this purpose.
As a result we generated 2-gram through 6-gram language models (6 was the maximum possible). This step adds ”sentence” boundary (”word” boundary here) symbols and, also as in the Baseline System, uses improved Kneser-Ney smoothing. We follow a common practice in machine translation where all examples of the target language, and not only forms present in parallel corpus translation pairs, are used to construct a language model. It is, therefore, based on a larger data set, and can lead to an improved translation quality. In our experiments with search logs and tree attachment datasets we used their respective lists of 250,000 most frequent surname forms for language model estimation.</p>

Users are identified by either their login session (“search” dataset) or by userid (“records” dataset). The reason that users where used in calculating Jaccard instead of just using co-occurrence counts and marginal counts has to do with preventing a few highly active users from skewing the results. This filter was used to remove name pairs that would be likely to co-occur by chance due to high frequency of each individual name involved in a pair. For instance, “Smith”-“Williams” pair would be filtered out.
After filtering we were left with 25k "record" and 12.5k “search” name pairs.</p>

Looking at random samples stratified by edit distance we manually evaluated these samples to estimate the false positive percentage.
We estimated that the rate of obvious false positives is 1.5% in “search” dataset and 1.4% in “records” dataset. We specifically avoided using string based similarity criteria when defining parallel corpus to prevent introducing bias. In principle, extra filters can be applied to training sets.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing phonetic methods with similarity measures and with machine translation methods is not straightforward. Phonetic methods only allow for binary responses (match or mismatch) when applied to name pairs. Therefore, it is impossible to rank positive matches without introducing additional ranking criteria.
Our machine translation (MT) method produces a score that we use in ranking. Similarity methods produce a similarity value that is also used in ranking. To get a meaningful comparison of these methods with phonetic methods we had to make use of statistics that we gathered while processing datasets. Additionally, we devised a unified methodology that could be applied to all listed method types.</p>

The same test folds were used to test all methods, including MT generated models, phonetic methods and similarity measures.</p>

Phonex method appears to be the weakest performer of the phonetic methods we have looked at.
Other phonetic methods lie in the middle and their confidence bands overlap. Because of the overlapping regions we cannot definitively rank the performance of these methods.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we presented a novel way of approaching alternative name spelling generation problem. We utilized a well-known methodology for comparing alternative name spelling methods and presented our results as precision-recall plots which clearly indicate not only that machine translation methods appear to be superior for our datasets to other methods but also show the rankings of other well known methods. We demonstrated our results using a unique dataset from Ancestry.com generated by millions of motivated users who are “experts” at labeling the dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The main conclusion of this work is that machine translation methods that we have employed for finding ranked list of alternative last name spellings far-outperformed all other methods we tried. Our results, also, indicated that the NYSIIS phonetic method significantly outperformed other phonetic algorithms and the Phonex phonetic method did not perform as well on our data. Additionally, Jaro-Winkler similarity method together with the Levenshtein edit distance method performed better than the Jaro method, which was in line with our expectations. On the other hand, we were surprised by how well the NYSIIS method performed compared to other phonetic methods. Our finding regarding phonetic methods performance went against findings reported by Christen in his 2006 paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, he was relying on very different dataset and that may explain the differences in our results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In future work we plan on training our models specifically on training sets composed of name pairs from the same country we plan on testing them against. We also plan on doing more experiments with full names including first names and initials. Additionally, we plan on trying MT methods on geographical locations such as town/village names.</p>
