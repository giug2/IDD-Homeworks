<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has recently experienced tremendous popularity due to its emphasis on user data privacy. However, the distributed computations of FL can result in constrained communication and drawn-out learning processes, necessitating the client-server communication cost optimization. The ratio of chosen clients and the quantity of local training passes are two hyperparameters that have a significant impact on the performance of FL. Due to different training preferences across various applications, it can be difficult for FL practitioners to manually select such hyperparameters. In this paper, we introduce FedAVO, a novel FL algorithm that enhances communication effectiveness by selecting the best hyperparameters leveraging the African Vulture Optimizer (AVO). Our research demonstrates that the communication costs associated with FL operations can be substantially reduced by adopting AVO for FL hyperparameter adjustment. Through extensive evaluations of FedAVO on benchmark datasets,
we identify the optimal hyperparameters that are appropriately fitted for the benchmark datasets, eventually increasing global model accuracy by 6% in comparison to the state-of-the-art FL algorithms (such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedPSO). The code, data, and experiments have been made publicly available on our GitHub repository<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/speedlab-git/FedAVO" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/speedlab-git/FedAVO</a></span></span></span>.</p>

<p id="p1.2" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces a novel and impactful approach to enhancing communication efficiency in FL. Our proposed FedAVO method addresses the challenge of communication overhead in FL, paving the way for significant advancements in distributed machine learning. This novel solution reduces communication rounds, thereby optimizing resource utilization, and also tailors a creative adaptation of nature-inspired optimization techniques for practical computing applications. The potential impact of FedAVO extends to various domains, including privacy-preserving FL, edge computing, and applications requiring real-time model updates such as such as connected autonomous vehicles. This research contributes not only to the technical landscape of FL but also holds promise for improving the scalability, speed, and sustainability of federated learning methodologies.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of diverse consumer electronics, including IoT devices, home appliances, smartphones, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), drones, Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) devices, has witnessed substantial growth in recent years. These devices capture and store various forms of data such as images, audio, and text.Image, audio, and text are just a few of the different forms of data that such devices acquire and store.
Every day brings a slight increase in the number of IoT-related applications, their users, and the amount of data they produce. This phenomenon is pioneering the scope of data-driven decision-making. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these collected data, training machine learning models comes with the following challenges: <span id="S1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">widely distributed</span>: data points are stored in a large number of clients, which can be significantly higher than the average number of training samples retained on a given client; <span id="S1.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">non-IID Data</span>: each client’s data may not accurately represent the entire distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> of a dataset; <span id="S1.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">unbalanced Data</span>: clients may hold different magnitudes of data points; <span id="S1.p1.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">communication constraints</span>: Mobile or IoT devices frequently may experience poor, expensive, or no internet connectivity; <span id="S1.p1.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">communication cost</span>: data collection from edge devices is significantly high. Moreover, transferring the data to the central server for training requires additional network bandwidth.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The study FL has made substantial progress in addressing the aforementioned challenges. FL is a machine learning (ML) paradigm that trains ML models utilizing decentralized data. FL protects data privacy by preventing data transfer from local machines to a centralized server. Each edge devices train the model on its own data locally using its computation resources. Instead of sending local data to the central server, only the local updates are sent. By providing only the local updates, FL cuts down the bandwidth overhead and also the communication cost. For these distinctive qualities, FL has been adopted in a wide range of applications such as speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, surveillance system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, health care system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, Internet of Things (IoT)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, human stroke prevention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and cybersecurity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. An FL paradigm includes local training, client-server communication, and model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Often communication overhead in FL comes from model broadcast from the server to all clients and vice versa. Furthermore, there is a feasibility risk in every communication round in terms of constrained network bandwidth, packet transmission loss, and privacy invasion. Apart from communication overhead and privacy invasion, training on heterogeneous setups opposes some more challenges. After the centralized server broadcasts its model, the clients train the model while considering some hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch dimension, and rounds per epoch. These diversely trained client models are difficult to aggregate since computational power and data attributes (complexity, ambiguity) differ vastly between each edge device. In an idealistic scenario of hundreds, even thousands of devices, the updated global model may never converge to a global optimum due to the heterogeneous behavior of the clients. Existing aggregation techniques (e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, FedMa <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>) only focus on integrating weights of local models. To increase generalization and convergence rate, some novel approaches suggested model aggregation by using feature fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> of global and local models or using multiple global models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.3" class="ltx_p">Along with the typical hyperparameters of model training, such as learning rates, optimizers, and mini-batch sizes, FL also has particular hyperparameters, such as local epochs and participant selection. The selection of these hyperparameters can drastically affect the performance of FL. The impact of hyperparameter tuning is much higher in Non-IID data distribution because data samples are radically different from each other across the clients. Although hyperparameter tuning optimization (HTO) has been widely explored in centralized machine learning, several aspects of HTO in FL settings yet need to be studied. In centralized machine learning, the model often trains on the entire dataset, which is often not viable in FL settings. In addition to that, models train on a wide range of hyperparameter configurations, which is extremely expensive in terms of communication and training time in FL settings because each FL cycle consists of multiple phases and communication rounds, and the model must complete each communication round in order to evaluate or change any hyperparameters. Finally, the same hyperparameter configuration functions less well as centralized machine learning due to the heterogeneous behavior of the clients and their data in FL settings. A few strategies for FL-HTO have recently been put forth; however, they concentrate on handling HTO using personalization techniques and neural networks, and they often lack in optimizing the communication cost and convergence rate. In this study, we optimize automated hyperparameter tuning with the help of a meta-heuristic algorithm. We propose FedAVO, which can configure and tune hyperparameters locally concerning the data distribution and their quality. To summarize, our proposed work outlines three novel contributions, which are listed as follows:

Our findings reveal a notable decrease in communication overhead and an increase in convergence rate. Compared to FedAvg, FedAVO reduces the requirement of communication rounds to reach convergence by 80 on average. In addition, FedAVO converges much faster and achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art FL algorithms. For instance, FedAVO achieves 99.47% accuracy with MNIST Non-IID distribution and 72.64% accuracy with CIFAR-10 Non-IID distribution. Moreover, for Fashion MNIST and LISA datasets, FedAVO achieves consecutive global accuracies of 85.28% and 92.88%, respectively.

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL with AVO, we can liken vultures to computational entities or clients in the learning process. Well-fed vultures represent entities with ample resources and energy, allowing them to explore the optimization landscape extensively and perform resource-intensive computations. They handle complex tasks in Federated Learning. Conversely, starving vultures symbolize resource-constrained or energy-depleted entities, lacking capacity for prolonged and resource-intensive computations, similar to hungry vultures unable to sustain extended flights. In FL, these entities may face limitations like restricted resources or communication bandwidth. Starvation rate among vultures significantly affects the optimization process’s exploration and development phases. Changes in this rate directly impact collaboration, strategy adaptation, and computational allocation within the FL ecosystem. Ultimately, these dynamics shape the optimization process in FL with AVO

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rising prevalence of smart and IoT devices in daily life has amplified the need for FL, primarily due to its capability to safeguard data privacy during the model training process. Consequently, there has been a surge in the exploration of efficient optimization techniques tailored to FL.
Researchers have directed their attention to various facets of FL, encompassing aspects such as communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the intricate dynamics of statistical and system heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and cybersecurity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. One particular area of interest that aligns with our research focus revolves around the reduction of communication rounds in federated learning. Our approach to achieving this reduction centers on the optimization of hyperparameters.
These hyperparameters, pivotal components of a model, govern its ability to glean insights from a specific dataset.In order to achieve better performance, the hyperparameters need to be fine-tuned with different datasets and different models.
The most straightforward automated approach for adjusting hyperparameters involves conducting random searches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> within the hyperparameter space to identify the best-performing set. However, this method was surpassed by Bayesian techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, which leverage the performance of previously chosen hyperparameters to inform the selection of new ones. Notably, these methods demand substantial computational resources, as the complete training process must be executed to assess hyperparameter fitness. To mitigate the computational burden, there is a shift toward employing partial training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> with pre-selected hyperparameters. Nevertheless, even with this approach, running full or partial training to identify optimal hyperparameters within resource-constrained FL environments, where communication budgets are limited, remains prohibitively costly and cumbersome.
While several researchers have explored the optimization of machine learning (ML) models and their hyperparameters using evolutionary algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, including techniques like whale optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and genetic algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, the same level of attention has not been given to FL. There have been only a few attempts to address FL HTO problems. For instance, the FLoRA framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> introduces a novel HTO strategy where global hyperparameters are determined by selecting well-performing hyperparameters from local clients. FedEx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, on the other hand, optimizes hyperparameter tuning by leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques with a weight-sharing architecture.
Nevertheless, several optimization approaches encounter challenges in certain FL scenarios by inadvertently introducing overhead during hyperparameter tuning. Our proposed HTO method strives to bridge the existing gaps, presenting an efficient approach to optimize hyperparameters within the FL framework.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which employs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as its optimizer, our proposed method introduces a crucial modification aimed at automating the hyperparameter tuning process for SGD.
This adjustment has proven to yield substantial improvements in empirical performance, enabling faster convergence with a reduced number of communication rounds. To facilitate a better understanding of the approach, we have detailed the specific parameters and their notations in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4 Proposed Framework: FedAVO ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Local training on client devices:</span> In the first phase, each client performs independent local model training using the initial parameters received from the central server.

Notably, this updating process occurs in complete isolation, devoid of any communication between clients or with the server.

Vultures from the population forage through the given problem spaces for an optimal solution for a given problem. The vultures’ movement is influenced by their individual experiences and interactions with other vultures within the population. Furthermore, to enhance foraging efficiency, vultures that repeatedly fail to obtain optimal solutions after a predefined number of attempts share their findings with other vultures. This iterative foraging process continues until a predetermined number of iterations or until a satisfactory solution is achieved, thereby optimizing the hyperparameters for the FL system effectively.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our study aims to improve the convergence rate and performance of FL algorithms. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm (FedAVO), we conduct experiments and examine the convergence speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we assess if the model achieves acceptable convergence speed and accuracy after the automated HTO with AVO compared to the baseline algorithm Vanilla FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
In addition, we compare our experimental results with other benchmark FL algorithms such as FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and FedEnsemble <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We employ a High-Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC), which has two strong GPUs (each with 2,880 extra cores) and 800 CPU cores and can process up to 34 Teraflops of computations per second (one Teraflop is one million million calculations per second). In the test code, Pytorch (stable version 2.0.0) and Keras (version 2.12.0) are used.
For the evaluation of FedAVO, we considered four widely used image classification datasets: CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, Fashion MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, and LISA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. These datasets are chosen for their frequent usage in the field of image classification. For FL training, we partition these datasets into Independent and identically distributed (IID) and Non-IID settings.
To tackle experimental datasets involving image data, we employ three distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in our initial experiment. For MNIST, we consider a simple two-layer CNN model with 28 and 64 channels, each followed by 2 x 2 maximum pooling. This model aligns with the model used to evaluate MNIST in FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. To ensure fairness, we match the model and parameter numbers (1,663,370 total parameters) to the FedAvg. However, for CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, we opt for three convolution layers better results. Subsequently, for training on the LISA dataset, we utilize a combination of 5 convolution layers and 3 dense layers. Since our primary focus lies in evaluating the effectiveness of our proposed hyperparameter tuning optimization method rather than achieving maximal accuracy, we find the standard CIFAR-10 model well-suited for our purposes.</p>

On the contrary, for FedAVO, we initialize a problem space with lower bounds and upper bounds of the hyperparameters as shown in table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, and we initialize the population size (<math id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math>) with 50. For both algorithms, we set the batch size to 16 and the number of clients to 10. The local epochs number is set to 5 for each communication round in FedAvg training, but for FedAVO, we specify the local epochs number in the problem space for the HTO.
The range of hyperparameters shown in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> differs based on the type of data distribution. In the case of Non-IID distribution, a higher learning rate combined with lower momentum and weight decay proves to be more effective compared to a lower learning rate with higher momentum and weight decay. In the context of FedAVO, as discussed in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Proposed Framework: FedAVO ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the limit for local epochs is maintained between 1 and 5 to prevent model overfitting. Using a significantly higher number of local epochs would lead to overfitting of the model.</p>

For each of our experiments, we run upto 500 FL communication rounds.
Furthermore, To evaluate proposed HTO, we also compare with two state-of-the-art population-based optimizers, PSO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and GWO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Note that, we incorporate PSO and GWO instead of AVO as an HTO
naming them FedPSO and FedGWO. Subsequently, we conduct a performance comparison with FedAVO, demonstrating that AVO outperforms these population-based optimizers.</p>

From the comparison, the following inferences can be drawn: (1) Illustrated in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a) and Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(b), FedAVO consistently exhibits remarkable performance in terms of both global model accuracy and loss minimization in Non-IID distribution. (2) In our experiments, We explore different numbers of hyperparameter tuning epoch denoted as t to evaluate their respective performance. FedAVO outperforms other baseline algorithms by a considerable margin with tuning epoch 3 in terms of global model accuracy, Which demonstrates FedAVO performs better with a higher number of training epoch. However, even with 1 tuning epoch, our proposed method performs notably better than other FL algorithms as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a). Likewise, in terms of loss minimization, FedAVO with 3 epochs shows better performance compared to Vanilla FedAVG and FedGWO shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(b).</p>

Algorithms that surpass the threshold in fewer communication rounds are deemed to have a higher convergence rate. For the MNIST dataset, under Non-IID distribution FedAVO outperforms FedAvg by reducing communication rounds by 80. Remarkably, FedAVO achieves the specified threshold within 100 communication rounds. Furthermore, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, as depicted in Figure <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Experimental Results ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ FedAVO: Improving Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning with African Vultures Optimizer" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(b), FedAVO demonstrates expedited convergence. To further evaluate FedAVO, we set a 60% threshold for CIFAR-10. In contrast to FedAvg, FedAVO exhibits robust performance in CIFAR-10 Non-IID scenarios, reaching the threshold within 300 communication rounds compared to FedAvg’s 450 rounds. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, FedAVO effectively reduces communication rounds by up to 150. Based on our extensive result analysis, we can conclude that the implementation of FedAVO within FL techniques can halve or even more the communication round requirements, showcasing its efficacy in enhancing the convergence rate.</p>

Additionally, we showcase our empirical analysis in IID settings to provide a comprehensive overview of FedAVO’s performance. For CIFAR-10 dataset, FedAVO increases the performance gain compared to FedAvg from 67.48% to 76.34% on IID data and 65.13% to 72.64% on non-IID data. With MNIST dataset FedAVO shows a 6% increase in global accuracy compared to FedAvg. Although with CIFAR-10 IID distribution, FEDENSEMBLE shows slightly better performance by leveraging the benefit of having ensemble predictions from the user models, FedAVO shows substantially better performance on the Non-IID distribution of CIFAR-10. From the mentioned table, we can also observe that for MNIST and CIFAR-10 Non-IID distribution, FedAVO achieves 99.47% and 72.64% accuracy, respectively.
Our experimentation on the Fashion-MNIST and LISA datasets offers additional evidence supporting our claim that FedAVO consistently yields enhanced performance in terms of global accuracy. In heterogeneous systems for both of the aforementioned datasets, FedAVO shows a 5.5% increase on average in terms of global accuracy.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This research focuses on reducing communication overhead in federated learning (FL) by fine-tuning the hyperparameters of consumer electronics devices involved in edge learning. FedAVO, our advanced FL algorithm, optimizes hyperparameter adjustments to significantly enhance FL performance. We conducted a thorough assessment on benchmark datasets, comparing FedAVO against state-of-the-art FL algorithms. The results unequivocally establish FedAVO’s superiority over widely adopted FL algorithms like FedAvg, FedPSO, FedEnsemble, and FedGWO, showcasing an average global accuracy improvement of up to 6%. Notably, FedAVO exhibits exceptional capabilities in reducing communication rounds, achieving an average reduction of 30 rounds for the MNIST dataset compared to FedAvg and a substantial reduction of around 150 rounds for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Even when compared to FedGWO and FedPSO, FedAVO significantly reduces communication rounds by up to 50 for CIFAR-10 and an average reduction of 20 for MNIST. Moreover, FedAVO’s adaptability extends to various FL contexts and time-sensitive systems, promising performance enhancements and reduced round requirements in practical real-world scenarios. Future research will explore further improvements in network communication performance by addressing challenges like the risk of local minima and facilitating P2P-AVO communication among clients, potentially through the implementation of dynamic multi-vulture AVO.</p>
