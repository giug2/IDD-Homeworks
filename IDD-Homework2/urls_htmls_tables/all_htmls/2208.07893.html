<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Multi-server Federated learning (FL) has been considered as a promising solution to address the limited communication resource problem of single-server FL. We consider a typical multi-server FL architecture, where the coverage areas of regional servers may overlap. The key point of this architecture is that the clients located in the overlapping areas update their local models based on the average model of all accessible regional models, which enables indirect model sharing among different regional servers. Due to the complicated network topology, the convergence analysis is much more challenging than single-server FL. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel MS-FedAvg algorithm for this multi-server FL architecture and analyze its convergence on non-iid datasets for general non-convex settings. Since the number of clients located in each regional server is much less than single-server FL, the bandwidth of each client should be large enough to successfully communicate training models with the server, which indicates that full client participation can work in multi-server FL. Also, we provide the convergence analysis of the partial client participation scheme and develop a new biased partial participation strategy to further accelerate convergence. Our results indicate that the convergence results highly depend on the ratio of the number of clients in each area type to the total number of clients in all three strategies. The extensive experiments show remarkable performance and support our theoretical results.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the explosive growth in the numbers of mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, a tremendous amount of data today is being generated at the network edge in a distributed manner. Sending this data to the cloud for processing not only puts a huge burden on the network but also raises serious data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> recently emerged as a distributed Machine Learning (ML) architecture that keeps all the training data on individual clients, thereby protecting client data privacy and mitigating network congestion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In its most common form, FL is an iterative process where in each communication round, clients train local ML models using their local training datasets based on the current global ML model, and then the server aggregates the local models uploaded by the clients to update the global model. Because FL is trained on distributed datasets and often involves many communication rounds of model data exchange between the clients and the server, improving the communication efficiency between clients and central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and handling heterogeneous local dataset distribution in each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> are two biggest challenges of FL and have received a large amount of research attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although promising progresses have been made, existing FL architectures and algorithms dominantly focus on the single-server system. Most FL studies consider that clients should download and upload the learning models with central server repeatedly in each communication round. This communication strategy may suffer a large communication delay in large-scale FL systems where many clients may be far away from the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This large delay between the server and the clients directly prolongs the learning time of the existing single-server-based FL system, especially when the server is placed on the cloud. As increasingly many applications are delay-sensitive, e.g., autonomous driving and wearable health monitoring, new FL architectures that involve multiple servers have been proposed to reduce the communication latency between the server and the clients.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In order to reduce the communication latency of FL, there are two main multiple servers FL approaches: (1) Hierarchical FL (HFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> introduces a hierarchical structure for model training where multiple edge servers are used to collect and aggregate local model updates from clients in their respective service areas and then send the aggregated result to the cloud server for final aggregation. However, since the models exchange between the edge servers and the cloud server is still required, HFL can still result in a long training delay when the propagation latency between the edge servers and the cloud server is large. (2) Clustered FL (CFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> divides clients into different clusters, and trains a separate ML model for each cluster. However, re-clustering computation may be required in many communication rounds, thereby significantly increasing the training complexity and time. In addition, some existing studies ignore the physical network connectivity constraints – a client may connect to only a subset of servers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a new FL architecture utilizing multiple servers is studied, which exploits the realistic deployment of 5G-and-beyond networks where a client can be located in the overlapping coverage areas of multiple servers. The network architectures of single-server FL, HFL, clustered FL and our proposed multi-server FL are shown in Fig. 1. The key idea is that clients download multiple models from all the edge servers they can access and train their local models based on the average of these models. Such an architecture has two main advantages. First, by performing model averaging on the client side, each server indirectly accesses the trained local models of clients not in its coverage while incurring a small model upload and download delay. Specifically, the broadcasting technique will not increase the communication burden. Second, instead of training multiple local models based on multiple downloaded models, each client only trains a single local model based on the average of the downloaded models, thereby avoiding extra computation and communication cost. <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Since the clients in overlapping areas should tackle multiple training models at the same time, the extra computation only comes from the averaging calculation, which is small compared to the local training process, and it can be negligible.</span> Although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> developed an algorithm for this architecture and empirically validated its effectiveness, they only proposed the strongly-convex loss function, which is very restricted, since most learning models are non-convex, e.g., neural network. In addition, the convergence results cannot show the impact on overlapping areas. In this paper, we improve upon this architecture, propose a new algorithm with two-sided learning rates, and provide theoretical convergence analysis of the more general non-convex loss function. In summary, we highlight our main contributions as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">1) We develop a novel MS-FedAvg algorithm on this multi-server FL architecture, based on the two-sided learning rates FedAvg.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">2) We study the convergence in the coverage area, where we call region, of each server. For non-convex loss functions and non-iid datasets, we provide convergence analysis for full and unbiased partial client participation strategies, respectively. Our results are better than the existing multi-server FL algorithms and also reveal how the overlapping coverage affects the convergence in each region.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">3) To further improve the convergence speed of MS-FedAvg, we develop a biased partial client participation strategy where clients may not be selected proportionally to the number of clients in different coverage areas. Our analysis shows that the degree of bias results in a trade-off between convergence rate and accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">4) We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets under different multi-server FL network architectures and hyper-parameters. The experimental results show that our MS-FedAvg algorithm outperforms the compared benchmarks from accuracy and convergence perspectives.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A single-server FL system may incur a large delay if clients are distributed in the network, some of which may be far away from the server. Developing a multi-server FL network architecture is a potential way to address this problem, e.g., Hierarchical FL (HFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and Clustered FL (CFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. While HFL requires the models on edge server should be aggregated on the global server every several communication rounds, it also incurs the extra transmission delay. CFL needs to re-cluster the clients every communication round based on a specific rule, e.g., model similarity or location, it is difficult to avoid the clients are far away from the edge server which should be clustered.</p>

Together with the model averaging at the servers, this two-sided model averaging process allows the servers to indirectly access the local models of clients outside their regions instead of combining local model updates from the clients in overlapping areas (Line 13), which bridges the regional model sharing, thereby fully utilizing all clients’ data in the network.</span> <span id="S3.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Specifically, optimizing the placement of the limited number of regional servers in the current mobile computing system to maximize the total coverage is considered rather important. For example, some popular ES placement algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> have shown that one overlapping area at most includes four regional servers. Therefore, we consider that the additional transmission latency of the overlapping areas clients mentioned in the paper can be very small and negligible.</span> Although the clients located in the overlapping area, we can leverage the broadcast technique that cannot incur high burden of communication.</p>

<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Since we consider that the regional server is similar to the edge server, where the coverage is very restricted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the number of clients in the region of each regional server are much fewer than single-server FL. Therefore, the communication burden is less than single-server FL due to the shorter distance and more stable connection, and hence full client participation should work well in our proposed multi-server FL architecture.</span> In this paper, we only consider the location of clients is fixed for proving the convergence results of MS-FedAvg. <span id="S3.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The static scenario can be considered as the hospital data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> or environmental monitoring sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, where the clients cannot move and only connect to the corresponding regional server(s). As such, our MS-FedAvg can improve this scenario efficiently.</span> If the clients move randomly, each regional model can be assumed as an individual FL model approaching by FedAvg, which might degrade the training performance. In Section <a href="#S7" title="7 Experiments ‣ On the Convergence of Multi-Server Federated Learning with Overlapping Area" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we propose the experimental results of the movement scenario under our multi-server FL architecture. <span id="S3.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">More specifically, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> developed the FL-based license plate recognition and human activity recognition algorithm. Firstly, the recognition results can be quickly obtained due to the less transmission latency. On the other hand, when clients come into overlapping areas, multiple monitors can acquire more information and recognize them more accurately.</span></p>

<div id="S3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Because the regional models are averaged only in the final communication round, a significant amount of communication and computation cost among the regional servers can be saved. However, the model averaging at the client side also introduces an obvious difference compared to single-server FedAvg: the initial models of the clients, even for those in the same region, for local training in each communication round can be different depending on the their specific locations. Since we consider that the regional server is edge server and the coverage area is very restricted, the number of clients in the region of each regional server are much fewer than single-server FL. Therefore, the communication burden is less than single-server FL, and hence full client participation should work well in our proposed multi-server FL. <span id="S3.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In order to clarify the reducing of transmission latency compared to other FL architectures, we will show the detailed quantification in Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Transmission Latency Analysis ‣ On the Convergence of Multi-Server Federated Learning with Overlapping Area" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</span></p>

As discussed in the last section, the main difficulty of the convergence analysis lies in the heterogeneous initial models of clients in the region in each communication round. The convergence analysis encompasses non-iid datasets for general non-convex loss settings under both full and partial client participation strategies. Besides the existing random participation, i.e., unbiased client participation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, we also propose a new biased client participation strategy for our propose MS-FedAvg algorithm. To propose convergence results of MS-FedAvg, we first state some useful assumptions in this paper as follows:</p>

Although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> presented the experimental results based on CNN model and achieve improvement, it does not propose the theoretical analysis to support the result. Since most of existing machine learning algorithms are non-convex (e.g., CNN and LSTM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>), the theoretical results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is much more restricted. In this paper, the theoretical analysis and experiments are both on the general non-convex settings. In addition, the convergence analysis in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> leverages the BGD assumption, which has been considered a loose assumption in existing FL studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. As such, our convergence analysis is tighter than FedMes. Lastly, we propose two kinds of partial client participation strategies (each strategy has two sampling schemes), and analyze the training performance based on the ratio of the number of clients in different area types, which did not mention in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</span></span></p>

Hence, the final round aggregation does not have significant impact on the convergence. The implicit aggregation is due to the fact that the clients in overlapping areas share information across all regional models. Considering all factors in MS-FedAvg, including architecture, client distribution and heterogeneous local dataset makes the contribution of the implicit aggregation to be captured difficultly so that the full analysis mathematically intractable. Thus, we bound the factors that depend on the convergence results between different servers via Assumption <a href="#Thmassumption4" title="Assumption 4. ‣ 4 Convergence Analysis of MS-FedAvg ‣ On the Convergence of Multi-Server Federated Learning with Overlapping Area" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, and analyze the convergence in each region. As such, the problem becomes tractable and at the same time does not substantially impact the final results. In the future, we will set the multi-server FL as a bipartite graph, and propose the consensus analysis (i.e., the convergence gap between regional models and global model).</span></span></p>

For example, in CIFAR-10 dataset, MS-FedAvg can achieve 79.69% testing accuracy, which is 1.51%, 3.78% and 5.59% higher than HFL, IFCA and MC-PSGD. In particular, MC-PSGD converges fast but it achieves lowest accuracy, since the clustered model is easy to overfit to its own cluster. However, the global model performance is worst among all benchmarks, i.e., 74.10%. More specially, the disadvantage of HFL is due to that fact that for every 5 regional aggregation steps, it is required a global aggregation, which may degrade all the regional learning performance. <span id="S7.SS2.p2.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Although FedMes outperforms other three benchmarks, it does not achieve better convergence rate and accuracy than our proposed MS-FedAvg.

The reason may be due to the fact that that the regional model overfits these local clients and cannot generalize to all clients in the entire FL network. Therefore, if we use biased participation strategy, it is necessary to sample clients among all area types. The learning performance of Biased MS-FedAvg strongly depends on the network topology, and hence it is not easy to provide the optimized sampling strategy. However, it is feasible to find a sampling strategy which performs better than unbiased strategy.</p>

Because clustered FL needs to re-cluster every several communication rounds, the movement scenario can be ignored in this setting. Therefore, we only compare our proposed MS-FedAvg algorithm to HFL. Since we cannot justify the deterministic moving direction of each client, we assume that it randomly moving in each communication round. <span id="S7.SS2.p5.9.9" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Because of the restricted service area of regional server, we consider the movement scenario such as the moving sensors or IoT devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, which performs low movement speed (e.g., 3 miles per hour <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>). Compared to the transmission latency, the moving distance is very short and we can assume that each client connect the same corresponding regional server(s) within one communication round.

<p id="S7.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Clearly, we can see that the convergence rate of movement scenarios is much slower than static scenarios among all the multi-server FL settings, e.g., in CIFAR-10 dataset, movement is 77.08% and static is 79.84% of MS-FedAvg. And it only uses 91 communication rounds to achieve 75% testing accuracy, which is much better than movement scenario with 207 rounds. The reason is that since the clients may participate in different regional models training, it incur higher model variance between each communication round. As a result, it makes the global model to be converged difficultly. It is similar to train the same several regional models on each regional server. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider the movement scenario in this paper. In addition, it is clear to see that our proposed MS-FedAvg also outperforms other benchmarks in the movement scenarios. <span id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">If we assume more clients locate in the overlapping areas (e.g., setting 3), the training performance of both MS-FedAvg and HFL improve. For example, in setting 3, the movement scenario of MS-FedAvg has 48.75% testing accuracy and uses 279 to achieve 45% accuracy on CIFAR-100 dataset. This may be because the data distribution clients performs less diversity and near to the <math id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W=N" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">W</mi><mo mathcolor="#000000" id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">N</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑊</ci><ci id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑁</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS2.p6.1.1.m1.1c">W=N</annotation></semantics></math> scenario.

For the EMNIST dataset, the reason that FedAvg algorithm has the best performance is due to the fact that EMNIST dataset is simple, and easy to achieve targeted testing accuracy. For the more complicated datasets, it is clearly to see that MS-FedAvg outperforms single-server FL benchmarks. <span id="S7.SS3.p2.3.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Note that FedMes outperforms other three benchmarks, but it is worse than MS-FedAvg.</span></p>

Although the HFL and CFL algorithms spend less transmission latency for one communication round, it waste much more wall-clock time to achieve the targeted accuracy due to the low convergence rate, e.g., for CIFAR-10 dataset, HFL uses 191 round and 2555.58 sec, and IFCA uses 291 rounds and 4367.93 sec. Therefore, the existing multi-server FL benchmarks cannot guarantee to be efficient enough from the transmission perspective.</p>

For example, on EMNIST dataset, the testing accuracy of these three settings are 85.02%, 85.05% and 84.97%. The is due to the fact that the learning performance is independent on the network parameter settings, and only depends on the setting of learning models (e.g., data distribution and hyper-parameters). However, the bandwidth has a large influence on the transmission latency, because each regional server should wait for the slowest client that performs small bandwidth and then process the aggregation.

<p id="S7.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we aim to show the impact on multi-server FL network architecture. In this subsection, we additionally consider two more network architectures: asymmetric and 5 regional servers. As such, we simulate an asymmetric FL network architecture in Fig. <a href="#S7.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 7.4 Impact on Different Parameters ‣ 7 Experiments ‣ On the Convergence of Multi-Server Federated Learning with Overlapping Area" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, which also includes 3 regional servers and 85 clients in total. In addition, we present the learning performance of multi-server FL network architecture with 5 regional servers. To make the regional servers efficiently serve the clients, we assume that the overlapping areas at most includes 3 regional servers, and also keep the network within 85 clients.</p>

<p id="S7.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Fig. <a href="#S7.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 7.4 Impact on Different Parameters ‣ 7 Experiments ‣ On the Convergence of Multi-Server Federated Learning with Overlapping Area" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, it can be observed that the symmetric network architecture achieves the best learning performance on convergence perspective. The more complex network architecture, i.e., asymmetric and more regional servers, degrades the learning performance, especially incurring higher variance in each communication round. The observation may come from the unbalanced regional aggregation. Although they achieves the similar testing accuracy in final, symmetric network uses fewest communication rounds to achieve the targeted testing accuracy. <span id="S7.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In order to show the training performance for the large-scale multi-server FL network, we embed the EMNIST dataset on a 20 regional servers, which includes 150 clients. The MS-FedAvg also substantially outperforms HFL, which can achieve 84.68% testing accuracy (80.86% for HFL). It indicates that MS-FedAvg works stably on complicated networks.</span> Designing the relationship between the learning performance and network architectures will be our further work. More specially, it is worth noting that all the learning performance under different networks, MS-FedAvg significantly outperforms HFL.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current research on FL wireless networks improved the communication efficiency on the following aspects. (1) how to properly allocate resource to clients. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> designs how to properly select clients and how bandwidth is allocated among the selected clients in each communication round. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> jointly considers bandwidth allocation and clients scheduling problem. For bandwidth allocation sub-problem, they aim to allocate more bandwidth to the clients with worse channel conditions, and develops a greedy policy to solve the clients scheduling sub-problem. (2) deadline based FL architecture. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> develops clients selection algorithm for deadline based HFL via contextual combinatorial multi-armed bandits to improve the training performance. (3) physical layer quantization. For bandwidth reduction, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> sparsifies the gradient estimates of clients to accumulate error from previous communication rounds, and project the resultant sparse into a low-dimensional vector. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, they clarify how to communicate between clients and the central server and evaluate the impact on the various quantization. In addition, they design the physical layer quantization both on uplink and downlink. They mainly minimize the communication latency by solving an optimization problem subject to the constraint of obtaining a good model. However, few of them propose the details of the convergence guarantee in their papers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL was first proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, where they proposed the FedAvg algorithm and showed the advantages empirically on different datasets and local dataset distribution settings. Followed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, the authors propose the strategy to address the communication bottleneck problem by increasing the local training epochs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Specifically, this method is also a feasible solution to improve the convergence rate. Based on this method, some new algorithms are developed from different perspectives. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> adds a variant control variable to reduce the local model updates and global model due to the non-iid distribution of local datasets, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> designs FL algorithm for asynchronized FL via Hessian approximation. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> designs server level momentum and extends the local SGD optimizer to AdaGrad, YOGI and ADAM, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> proposes client level momentum FL algorithm, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> shows the impact on local batch size of both sided level momentum FL. However, these algorithms are mainly developed on single-server FL. In this paper, different from the above existing works, we derive the convergence results of the typical multi-server FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> that obtains the impact on non-iid datasets and the initial local models, which is much more challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the highly efficient edge computing architecture, some studies focus on edge facilitated FL: HFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and clustered FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, they also rely on communicating to the central server, large communication delay is difficult to be avoidable compared to our proposed multi-server FL. Another direction of distributed learning is fully decentralized/serverless <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>. In decentralized FL, clients need to exchange the model updates with their neighbors not to the servers. This is different from our proposed multi-server FL architecture, where the local model updates are required to be aggregated on regional servers. However, even though the network of decentralized FL is well-connected, it is not avoidable to reduce the degradation due large communication delay, since the bandwidth of each client should be much less than edge computing.</p>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed the MS-FedAvg algorithm and presented theoretical analysis on non-iid datasets in general non-convex settings on a multi-server FL architecture with overlapping areas, which can reduce the transmission latency compared to traditional single-server FL. Our theoretical results reveal how the overlapping areas accelerate the convergence of the final global model. In addition, MS-FedAvg algorithm achieves a linear speedup under full/unbiased partial client participation strategies compared to the existing multi-server FL algorithms. To further improve the convergence rate, we develop a biased partial client participation strategy. Both theoretical and empirical results show the degree of bias results in a trade-off between convergence rate and accuracy, and outperforms other existing multi-server FL architectures. Although our work is based on the fundamental theory of traditional FL, it also opens to doors to many new interesting questions in FL studies. For the future work, we plan to investigate how to design the algorithms based on the topology of the multi-server FL architecture, and the consensus control.</p>
