<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Since 2016 federated learning (FL) has been an evolving topic of discussion in the artificial intelligence (AI) research community. Applications of FL led to the development and study of federated reinforcement learning (FRL). Few works exist on the topic of FRL applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) platoons. In addition, most FRL works choose a single aggregation method (usually weight or gradient aggregation). We explore FRL’s effectiveness as a means to improve AV platooning by designing and implementing an FRL framework atop a custom AV platoon environment. The application of FRL in AV platooning is studied under two scenarios: (1) Inter-platoon FRL (Inter-FRL) where FRL is applied to AVs across different platoons; (2) Intra-platoon FRL (Intra-FRL) where FRL is applied to AVs within a single platoon. Both Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL are applied to a custom AV platooning environment using both gradient and weight aggregation to observe the performance effects FRL can have on AV platoons relative to an AV platooning environment trained without FRL. It is concluded that Intra-FRL using weight aggregation (Intra-FRLWA) provides the best performance for controlling an AV platoon. In addition, we found that weight aggregation in FRL for AV platooning provides increases in performance relative to gradient aggregation. Finally, a performance analysis is conducted for Intra-FRLWA versus a platooning environment without FRL for platoons of length 3, 4 and 5 vehicles. It is concluded that Intra-FRLWA largely out-performs the platooning environment that is trained without FRL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, federated learning (FL) and its extension federated reinforcement learning (FRL) have become a popular topic of discussion in the artificial intelligence (AI) community. The concept of FL was first proposed by Google with the development of the federated averaging (FedAvg) aggregation method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. FedAvg provided an increase in the performance of distributed systems while also providing privacy advantages when compared to centralized architectures for supervised machine learning (ML) tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. FL’s core ideology was initially motivated by the need to train ML models from distributed data sets across mobile devices while minimizing data leakage and network usage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Research on the topics of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made great progress over the years; however, there remain important challenges for ensuring the stable performance of DRL algorithms in the real world. DRL processes are often sensitive to small changes in the model space or hyper-parameter space, and as such the application of a single trained model across similar systems often leads to control inaccuracies or instability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In order to overcome the stability challenges that DRL poses, often a model must be manually customized to accommodate the finite differences amongst similar agents in a distributed system. FRL aims to overcome the aforementioned issues by allowing agents to share private information in a secure way. By utilizing an aggregation method, such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, systems with many agents can have decreased training times with increased performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the popularity of FL and FRL, to the best of our knowledge at the time of this study, there are no works applying FRL to platoon control. In general, there are two types of “models” for AV decision making: vehicle-following modeling and lane-changing modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. For the purposes of this study, the vehicle-following approach known as co-operative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is explored. Vehicle following models are based on following a vehicle on a single lane road with respect to a leading vehicle’s actions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. CACC is a multi-vehicle control strategy where vehicles follow one another in a line known as a platoon, while simultaneously transmitting vehicle data amongst each other <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. CACC platoons have been proven to improve traffic flow stability, throughput and safety for occupants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Traditionally controlled vehicle following models have limited accuracy, poor generalization from a lack of data, and a lack of adaptive updating <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We are motivated by the current state-of-the-art for CACC AV Platoons, along with previous works related to FRL, to apply FRL to the AV platooning problem and observe the performance benefits it may have on the system. We propose an FRL framework built atop a custom AV platooning environment in order to analyse FRL’s suitability for improving AV platoon performance. In addition, two approaches are proposed for applying FRL amongst AV platoons. The first proposed method is inter-platoon FRL (Inter-FRL), where FRL is applied to AVs across different platoons. The second proposed method is intra-platoon FRL (Intra-FRL), where FRL is applied to AVs within the same platoon. We investigate the possibility of Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL as a means to increase performance using two aggregation methods: averaging model weights and averaging gradients. Furthermore, the performance of Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL using both aggregation methods is studied relative to platooning environments trained without FRL (no-FRL). Finally, we compare the performance of Intra-FRL with weight averaging (Intra-FRLWA) against a platooning environment trained without FRL for platoons of length 3, 4 and 5 vehicles.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are two main areas of research in FRL currently: horizontal federated reinforcement learning (HFRL), and vertical federated reinforcement learning (VFRL). HFRL has been selected as the algorithm of choice for the purposes of this study. HFRL and VFRL differ with respect to the structure of their environments and aggregation methods. All agents in an HFRL architecture use isolated environments. It follows that each agent’s action in an HFRL system has no effect on the other agents in the system. An HFRL architecture proposes the following training cycle for each agent: first, a training step is performed locally, second, environment specific parameters are uploaded to the aggregation server, and lastly, parameters are aggregated according to the aggregation method and returned to each agent in the system for another local training step. HFRL may be noted to have similarities to “Parallel RL”. Parallel RL is a long studied field of RL, where agent gradients are transferred amongst each other <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning is often a sequential learning process, and as such data is often non-IID with a small sample space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. HFRL provides the ability to aggregate experience while increasing the sample efficiency, thus providing more accurate and stable learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A study by Lim <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> aims to increase the performance of RL methods applied to multi-IoT device systems. RL models trained on single devices are often unable to control devices in a similar albeit slightly different environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Currently, multiple devices need to be trained separately using separate RL agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The methods proposed by Lim <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> sped up the learning process by 1.5 times for a two agent system. In a study by Nadiger <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, the challenges in the personalization of dialogue managers, smart assistants and more are explored. RL has proven to be successful in practice for personalized experiences; however, long learning times and no sharing of data limit the ability for RL to be applied at scale. Applying HFRL to atari non-playable characters in pong showed a median improvement of  17% for the personalization time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Lastly, Liu <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> discuss RL as a promising algorithm for smart navigation systems, with the following challenges: long training times, poor generalization across environments, and storing data over long periods of time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In order to address these problems, Liu <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed the architecture ‘Lifelong FRL’, which can be categorized as an HFRL problem. It is found the Lifelong FRL increased the learning rate for smart navigation system when tested on robots in a cloud robotic system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The successes of the FedAvg algorithm as a means to improve performance and training times for systems have inspired further research into how aggregation methods should be applied. The design of the aggregation method is crucial in providing performance benefits to that of the base case where FRL is not applied. The FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> algorithm proposed the averaging of gradients in the aggregation method. In contrast, Liang <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed using model weights in the aggregation method for AV steering control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Thus, FRL applications can differ based upon the selection of which parameter to use in the aggregation method. A study by Zhang <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> explores applying FRL to a decentralized DRL system optimizing cellular vehicle-to-everything communication<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Zhang <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> utilize model weights in the aggregation method, and describe a weighting factor dividing the sum batch size for all agents by the training batch size for a specific agent<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In addition, the works of Lim <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> explore how FRL using gradient aggregation can improve convergence speed and performance on the OpenAI-gym environments CartPole-V0, MountainvehicleContinuous-V0, Pendulum-V0 and Acrobot-V1 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Lim <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> determined that aggregating gradients using FRL creates high performing agents for each of the OpenAI-gym environments relative to models trained without FRL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In addition, Wang <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> apply FRL to heterogeneous edge caching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Wang <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> show the effectiveness of FRL using weight aggregation to improve hit rate, reduce average delays in the network and offload traffic<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Lastly, Huang <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> apply FRL using model weight aggregation to Service Function Chains in network function virtualization enabled networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Huang <span id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> observe that FRL using model weight aggregation provides benefits to convergence speed, average reward and average resource consumption<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the differences in FRL applications within the aforementioned studies, each study maintains a similar goal: to improve the performance of each agent within the system. None of the aforementioned works explore the differences in whether gradient or model weight aggregation is favourable in performance, and many of the works apply FRL to distributed network or communications environments.

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, there has been a surge in autonomous vehicle (AV) research, likely due to the technologies potential for increasing road safety, traffic throughput and fuel economy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Two areas of research are often considered when delving into an AV model: supervised learning or RL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Driving is considered a multi-agent interaction problem, and due to the large variability of road data, it can be quite challenging (or near impossible) to gather a data set variable enough to train a supervised model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Driving data is collected from humans, which can also limit an AI’s ability to that of human level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In contrast, RL methods are known to generalize quite well <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. RL approaches are model-free and a model may be inferred by the algorithm while training.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to improve the limitations of vehicle following models, DRL has been a steady area of research in the AV community, with many authors contributing works to DRL applied to CACC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In a study by Lin <span id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, a DRL framework is designed to control a CACC AV platoon<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The DRL framework uses the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> algorithm and is found to have near-optimal performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. In addition, Peake <span id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> identify limitations in platooning with regard to the communication in platooning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Through the application of a multi-agent reinforcement learning process, i.e. a policy gradient RL and LSTM network, the performance of a platoon containing 3-5 vehicles is improved upon that of current RL applications to platooning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is the current state-of-the-art for real-time optimal control practices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. The study performed by Lin <span id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> applies both MPC and DRL methodologies to the AV platoon problem, observing a DRL model trained using the DDPG algorithm produces merely a 5.8% episodic cost higher than the current state-of-the-art<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. The works of Yan <span id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> propose a hybrid approach to the AV platooning problem where the platoon is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in order to collect two rewards from the system at each time step simultaneously<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. This approach also incorporates jerk, the rate of change of acceleration in the calculation of the reward for each vehicle in order to ensure passenger comfort <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. The hybrid strategy led to increased performance to that of the base DDPG algorithm, as the proposed framework switches between using classic CACC modeling and DDPG depending on the performance degradation of the DDPG algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. In another study by Zhu <span id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, a DRL model is formulated and trained using DDPG to be evaluated against real world driving data. Parameters such as time to collision, headway, and jerk were considered in the DRL model’s reward function<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. The DDPG algorithm provided favourable performance to that of the analysed human driving data, with regard to more efficient driving via reduced vehicle headways, and improved passenger comfort with lower magnitudes of jerk<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. As Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications are envisioned to have a beneficial impact on the performance of platoon controllers, the works of Lei <span id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> investigates the value of V2X communications for DRL-based platoon controllers.

<p id="S1.SS1.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When formulating the AV platooning problem as a DRL model DDPG is prominently selected as the algorithm for training. DDPG’s ability to handle continuous actions space and complex state’s is perfect for the CACC platoon problem. However, despite the DDPG algorithm’s success in literature, there are still instability challenges related to the algorithm along with a time consuming hyper-parameter tuning process to account for the minute differences in vehicle models/dynamics amongst platoons. As previously discussed, FRL provides advantages in these areas where information sharing can accelerate performance during training and improve the performance of the system as a whole. In addition, the ability to share experience across like models has been proven to allow for fast convergence of models, which further optimizes the performance of DDPG when applied to AV platoons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, no works at the time of this study existed covering the specific topic of FRL applied to platoon control. Many of the works existing on FRL have shown the benefits of FRL with regard to the increased rate of convergence and overall system performance with distributed networks, edge caching and communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, of the works cited in this study, the works closely related to FRL for platoon control are those of Peake <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> and Liang <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a><span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span>. In contrast to Liang <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, where FedAvg is applied successfully to control the steering angle of a single vehicle, we apply FRL to an AV platooning problem where the control of multiple vehicles’ positions and spacing are required <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Peake <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> explore multi-agent reinforcement learning and its ability to improve the performance of AV platoons experiencing communication delays<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Although Peake <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> are also successful in their approach, there is no specific reference to FRL in the paper<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In addition, a variety of existing works on FRL choose to use either gradients or model weights in the FRL aggregation method. This study explores how both aggregation methods can provide benefits to the AV platooning problem and, most importantly, which provides a better result. Finally, this study further distinguishes its approach from existing literature by declaring two possible ways to apply FRL to AV platooning:</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to existing literature, where it is common to average the parameters across each model in the system, for Intra-FRL, we propose a directional averaging where follower vehicles incorporate the preceding vehicle parameters in the computation of the gradients or weights. Thus, in Intra-FRL, the leading vehicle trains independently of those following. The AV platoon provides a unique playground environment suitable for exploring the suitability of FRL as a means to increase the performance of systems with regard to convergence rate and performance.</p>

The system is designed to allow the training of any number of equal length platoons. At the lowest level, a DDPG agent exists for each vehicle in each platoon. As such, a DRL model must be initialized for each vehicle in the whole system. Each DDPG agent trains separately from the others before data is uploaded to the FRL server. Federated averaging is applied at a given time delay known as the FRL update delay, while being terminated at a given episode as defined by the cutoff ratio as seen in Table <a href="#S3.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ III-A Experimental setup ‣ III Experimental Results ‣ AVDDPG – Federated reinforcement learning applied to autonomous platoon control" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.

During a training session with FRL, both local updates and FRL updates with
aggregated parameters are applied to each DDPG agent in the system. FRL updates usually
occur at a given frequency known as the FRL update delay, and furthermore, FRL updates
may be terminated at a specific training episode as defined by the FRL cutoff ratio. The FRL update delay is defined as the time in seconds between FRL updates during a training episode. The FRL cutoff ratio is the ratio of the number of episodes where FRL updates are applied divided by the total number of episodes in a training session. Note that the aggregation method denotes whether the model gradients or weights are averaged during training using FRL.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For the purposes of this study, an experiment is defined as a training session for a specific configuration of hyper-parameters, using the algorithm defined in Algorithm 1. During each experiment training session, model parameters were trained through the base DDPG algorithm or FRL in accordance with Algorithm 1. Once training has concluded, a simulation is performed using a custom built evaluator API. The evaluator performs simulations for a single 60 second episode using the trained models, calculating the cumulative reward of the model(s) in the experiment. The entire project is designed and implemented using Python3, and Tensorflow. As previously stated, each vehicle in the platoon is modelled using the CACC CTHP model described in Section 3. For the purposes of this study, multiple sets of DRL experiments were conducted, using 4 random seeds (1-4) for training and a single random seed (6) across all evaluations.</p>

For each of the 12 conducted experiments, 2 platoons with 2 vehicles each were trained using one of the four random seeds. Once training across the four seeds has completed, the cumulative reward for a single evaluation episode is evaluated. For the experiments using Inter-FRL, two aggregation methods are examined. First, the gradients of each model are averaged during training, and second, the model weights are averaged. The multi platoon system trains and shares the aggregated parameters (gradients or weights) amongst vehicles with the same index across platoons. The federated server is responsible for performing the averaging, and each vehicle performs a training episode with the averaged parameters in addition to their local training episodes in accordance with the FRL update delay and FRL cutoff ratio (see Table <a href="#S3.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ III-A Experimental setup ‣ III Experimental Results ‣ AVDDPG – Federated reinforcement learning applied to autonomous platoon control" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>).

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Intra-FRL relative to the base AV platooning scenario, 4 experiments are conducted without Intra-FRL (no-FRL), and 8 with. For each of the conducted experiments, 1 platoon with 2 vehicles is trained using 4 random seeds. A single platoon is required for studying Intra-FRL as parameters are shared amongst vehicles within the platoon (no sharing is performed from vehicle’s in one platoon to another). Once training across the four seeds is completed, the cumulative reward for a single evaluation episode is evaluated. Similar to the experiments using Inter-FRL, two aggregation methods are examined. First, the gradients of each model are averaged during training, and second, the model weights are averaged. The platoon trains and shares the aggregated parameters (gradients or weights) from vehicle to vehicle such that data is averaged and updated amongst vehicles within the same platoon. The federated server is responsible for performing the averaging, and each vehicle performs a training episode with the averaged parameters in addition to their local training episodes in accordance with the FRL update delay and FRL cutoff ratio (see Table <a href="#S3.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ III-A Experimental setup ‣ III Experimental Results ‣ AVDDPG – Federated reinforcement learning applied to autonomous platoon control" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>). Note that here-after Intra-FRL with gradient aggregation is denoted Intra-FRLGA, and Intra-FRL with weight aggregation is denoted Intra-FRLWA.</p>

Similar to the Inter-FRL experiments, Intra-FRLWA shows the most favourable training results. In addition, the rate of convergence increases with Intra-FRLWA over no-FRL and Intra-FRLGA. Lastly, the stability during training is also shown to be improved as the standard deviation across the four random seeds is much smaller than the other two cases (as evident in the shaded regions of Figure <a href="#S3.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ III-C2 Convergence properties ‣ III-C Intra-FRL ‣ III Experimental Results ‣ AVDDPG – Federated reinforcement learning applied to autonomous platoon control" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is clear that using weight aggregation in both Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL is favourable to gradient aggregation. In addition, Intra-FRLWA provides the overall best result. Intra-FRL likely converges to the best model due to conditions each agent experiences during training. For Inter-FRL, the environment is independent and identically distributed. For Intra-FRL, each follower’s training depends on the policy of the preceding vehicle. For the 2 vehicle scenario studied, vehicle 1 will converge prior to vehicle 2 as vehicle 1 learns based on the stochastic random input generated by the platoon leader. As vehicle 1 is training, vehicle 2 trains based off the policy of vehicle 1. As previously stated, Inter-FRL shares parameters amongst vehicles in the same index across platoons, where-as Intra-FRL provides the advantage of sharing parameters from preceding vehicles to following vehicles. Our implementation of Intra-FRL includes a directional parameter averaging. For example, vehicle 1 does not train with averaged parameters from the followers, but vehicle 2 has the advantage of including vehicle 1’s model in its averaging. This directional averaging provides an advantage to vehicle 2, as evidenced by the increased performance in Table <a href="#S3.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ III-D Comparison between inter and intra-FRL ‣ III Experimental Results ‣ AVDDPG – Federated reinforcement learning applied to autonomous platoon control" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An additional factor to consider when evaluating FRL in relation to the no-FRL base scenario is how FRL performs with increasing agents relative to no-FRL. In this section, 12 experiments are conducted with no-FRL, and 12 with Intra-FRLWA. Each set of 12 experiments for no-FRL and Intra-FRLWA are broken up by number of vehicles and random seed. The random seed is selected to be a value between 1 and 4, inclusive. In addition, the platoons under study contain either 3, 4, or 5 vehicles. Once training has been completed for all experiments, the cumulative reward for each experiment is evaluated using a single simulation episode in which the seed is kept constant. Intra-FRLWA is used as the FRL training strategy since Intra-FRLWA was identified to be the highest performing FRL strategy in the previous section.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The large difference in performance for no-FRL versus Intra-FRL can be explained by understanding how Intra-FRLWA works. With no-FRL, each agent trains independently, and the inputs to the following vehicles are directly outputted from the predecessors. Thus, the followers farther back in the platoon take longer to train as their predecessors’ outputs can be highly variable while training. As the policies of the predecessors converge, the policy of each follower can then begin to converge. This sequential convergence from predecessor to follower can be seen in Figure <a href="#S3.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ III-E2 Convergence properties ‣ III-E Intra-FRL with variant number of vehicles ‣ III Experimental Results ‣ AVDDPG – Federated reinforcement learning applied to autonomous platoon control" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, where the convergence during training is slower for vehicles 4 and 5 than it is for 3, 2 and 1. Intra-FRLWA helps to resolve this challenge by allowing vehicles to average their model weights, thus distributing an aggregation of more mature predecessor parameters amongst the platoon.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have formulated an AV platooning problem and successfully applied FRL in a variety of methods to AV platooning. In addition, we proposed new approaches for applying FRL to AV platoons: Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL. By comparing FRL performance with both gradient and weight averaging in the AV platooning scenario, it has been shown that weight averaging was the optimal aggregation method regardless of using Inter-FRL or Intra-FRL. Furthermore, it was found that the Intra-FRLWA strategy was most advantageous for applying FRL to AV platooning. Finally, it was proven that applying Intra-FRLWA to AV platoons up to 5 vehicles in length provided large performance advantages during and after training when compared to AV platoons that were controlled by DDPG agents trained without FRL. These results are backed by simulations performed using models trained across four random seeds, and an additional simulation set with variable platoon sizes. The focus of this paper was on decentralized platoon control, where each follower in the platoon trains locally with respect to their individual reward.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, improvements to the system could be made by implementing weighted averaging in the FRL aggregation method. Moreover, in AV platooning, communication delays can be considered in the model to give a more concrete real life example.</p>
