<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Video stabilization plays a central role to improve videos quality. However, despite the substantial progress made by these methods, they were, mainly, tested under standard weather and lighting conditions, and may perform poorly under adverse conditions.
In this paper, we propose a synthetic-aware adverse weather robust algorithm for video stabilization that does not require real data and can be trained only on synthetic data. We also present Silver, a novel rendering engine to generate the required training data with an automatic ground-truth extraction procedure. Our approach uses our specially generated synthetic data for training an affine transformation matrix estimator avoiding the feature extraction issues faced by current methods.
Additionally, since no video stabilization datasets under adverse conditions are available, we propose the novel VSAC105Real dataset for evaluation. We compare our method to five state-of-the-art video stabilization algorithms using two benchmarks. Our results show that current approaches perform poorly in at least one weather condition, and that, even training in a small dataset with synthetic data only, we achieve the best performance in terms of stability average score, distortion score, success rate, and average cropping ratio when considering all weather conditions. Hence, our video stabilization model generalizes well on real-world videos and does not require large-scale synthetic training data to converge.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the past several years, we have witnessed an explosion of videos being recorded and shared on the Internet. However, most shared videos are unedited and shaky, which makes them unpleasant to watch. Therefore, video stabilization techniques became an essential step in the video processing pipeline, gaining momentum as more unedited videos are being created and shared.
State-of-the-art video stabilization approaches perform well under standard conditions but struggle at adverse conditions. Furthermore, collecting training videos in these adverse conditions is hard, dangerous, and time-consuming.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The training data bottleneck mentioned above causes many video stabilization methods to be essentially non-learning-based commonly adopting affine or homography matrix estimation in the camera motion estimation step, to extract the camera trajectory. Usually, features extraction, description, and matching are involved in this process. Feature extractors like SIFT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and the learning-based ones, like R2D2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and ASLFeat <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, can perform well under standard weather conditions and enough illumination, but they may fail under challenging conditions such as foggy, rainy, and snowy weather, as well as night-time scenes and abrupt changes of illumination. For instance, rain and snow drop particles and textureless scenes under fog or at night-time pose a clear challenge to find sufficient robust features. Failing to accurately estimate the actual camera trajectory, in the motion estimation step, causes the error to propagate to the later steps of the process, decreasing the quality of the stabilized video.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data have shown a great progress in the field of computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Its increase in popularity started to attract many researchers to apply it for different computer vision problems. Most importantly, synthetic data seems a promising solution to overcome the lack of suitable data for training supervised learning models. However, we believe that the potential of synthetic data is not simply in the amount of available data for training.
In fact, in this paper we propose a novel synthetic-aware video stabilization algorithm that leverages synthetic data and achieves state-of-the-art results using only a small-scale synthetic dataset. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Leveraging Synthetic Data to Learn Video Stabilization Under Adverse Conditions The paper is under review." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> depicts the main steps of this approach. Leveraging the powerful tools of the Unity game engine, we built <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Silver</span>, which creates three-dimensional, photo-realistic virtual worlds procedurally at run-time. The system can automatically diversify many essential scene attributes like weather conditions, time of the day, crowdedness, to name a few. Most importantly, our system can generate the required ground-truth training data for our learning-based video stabilization method.
Our novel video stabilization model can be trained with a small number of synthetic videos. With no training or fine-tuning on real data, our model is more robust and accurate than the state-of-the-art across different weather conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study video stabilization under adverse weather conditions and utilize synthetic videos for video stabilization.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite supervised learning-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> being able to learn parameters like cropping window, sensitivity, and even to extract discriminative features, there is no sufficient labeled data for obtaining high-quality results in any condition.
Finding, collecting, and annotating relevant data is cumbersome, time-consuming, error-prone, expensive, and subject to privacy issues. It is widely accepted that collecting many videos under adverse conditions is not easy since various attributes are needed to be diversified, such as camera motion, scene type, time of the day, scene crowdedness, and recording resolution. Even assuming that videos under these attributes can be captured, there is still a problem capturing training data for this task. Using two cameras, one with a mechanical stabilizer and another without, is still not an ideal solution since the difference between the two camera locations will cause the scene to be captured from two different viewpoints. Thus, learning-based models may not be able to learn well the video stabilization task, especially under adverse conditions.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Video Stabilization</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Video stabilization methods can be categorized broadly into non-learning-based and learning-based approaches.
Non-learning-based video stabilization methods do not perform training. For instance, Grundmann <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> stabilize the shaky camera trajectory using L1-norm optimization under constraints.
Similarly,
Bradley <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> address the stabilization task as a constrained convex optimization problem.
These non-learning-based methods stabilize videos without the need for training data to tune the model’s parameters. However, they tend to give less pleasant results, can work only under predefined conditions, and the model’s parameters must be tuned manually.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The learning-based approaches, on their turn, can be classified into unsupervised and supervised approaches.
Non-supervised video stabilization methods require training videos but do not demand for annotated pairs of shaky-stable videos.
Deep Iterative FRame INTerpolation (DIFRINT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> is an unsupervised learning-based approach that can be trained in an end-to-end manner. It can stabilize videos without cropping original frames. Essentially, this method utilizes the frame interpolation technique to synthesize middle frames for video stabilization.
Supervised learning approaches, on the other hand, require human labeled ground-truth data, which is the main limitation of applying them to video stabilization.
Some works approached this problem using a mechanical stabilizer to generate ground-truth stable videos with their shaky counterparts. As an example, StabNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> followed this procedure, generating videos for training CNNs for video stabilization. The network learns a warping transformation of multi-grids given the shaky video frames and the previously stabilized ones. On the other hand, Liu <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> apply a learning-based hybrid-space fusion to compensate for optical flow inaccuracy. They synthesize stabilized frames by fusing the warped content estimated from neighboring frames.
Yu <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> learn to stabilize videos using optical flow. They compute the per-pixel warp field from the optical flow of the shaky video, allowing to better handle moving objects and occlusion.
In contrast to the work of Yu <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, Ali <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> propose a full-frame supervised video stabilization method that does not require optical flow. Their novel pipeline for dataset generation uses a linearly moving window on high-resolution images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the substantial progress made by these methods, they present a partial solution to the video stabilization problem since it is assumed that they will work under normal weather conditions and sufficient illumination. However, finding resilient features in adverse conditions is rather challenging. For example, rain particles, foggy weather conditions, and low illumination pose clear challenges to finding robust features. Thus, it leads to inaccurate motion estimation and low-quality video stabilization. At the same time, collecting diverse real-world videos for training video stabilization methods is cumbersome and time-consuming. Moreover, obtaining data with perfect ground-truth is not feasible given the physical limitation of recording the same scene from the same perspective via steady and shaky cameras.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our video stabilization method belongs to the supervised learning-based category. However, unlike other methods, we use only synthetic data for training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize synthetic videos for video stabilization. No pre-training or fine-tuning on real data is required, and by using only a small-scale training dataset, our method is more robust than state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Estimating the affine or homography transformation between two images are two common approaches to align one image to another. For that aim, there are different ways to find these matrices like applying a feature extractor (<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>.<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>., SIFT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, ORB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, SURF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and OAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>) and an outlier rejection algorithm (<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>.<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>., RANSAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and MAGSAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>). At the same time, there are unsupervised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and supervised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> methods that estimate, specifically, the homography matrix.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the traditional approach, <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, feature extraction, does well at standard conditions, it performs poorly under challenging conditions such as adverse weather conditions and low illumination. Moreover, supervised approaches cannot reflect scene parallax <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and generating a suitable training data is rather hard. Unsupervised approaches tried to solve these problems but they still fail under large baseline alignment which makes it unpractical for applications such as image stitching and video stabilization under sharp camera movements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike previous methods, our model learns the affine transformation in a supervised manner using specially generated synthetic training data for this task and it does not need any real data in training time.
Estimating the affine transformation is of a special importance in video stabilization because it allows us to recover the camera translation, rotation, and scale.
Although it is possible to decompose the homography matrix to extract these information, it is not accurate. Moreover, training a model to estimate the affine transformation is much easier compared to estimating the homography transformation. As have been discussed by other similar works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, although homography can better model the camera motion between frames for a limited number of frames, it starts to cause many artifacts like skew and perspective as the number of frames becomes larger. At the same time, higher degrees of freedom transformations (e.g., homography) overfit easily even with some regularization. Thus, utilizing homography transformation is both harder to train (more parameters and easier to overfit) and more subject to artifacts.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the great advancements of the previous simulators, they present a partial solution for the data generation issue because of the lack of control on the environmental elements. They also fail to randomize the scene elements which will lead to some clear repetitions (to scene elements) when a large-scale dataset is required to be generated by these methods.
In our simulator, we utilize procedural content generation to generate 3D virtual worlds. Additionally, our simulator can generate a special training data for the task of video stabilization.
In our experiments, we show that generating appropriate training data and creating a pipeline that utilizes synthetic data, can achieve superior results.
In fact, our algorithm can still provide better results in real videos even though our engine does not generate state-of-the-art photo-realistic videos. Additionally, our synthetic aware algorithm and our specially designed synthetic data both contribute to teaching the model to accurately estimate the affine transformation while not overfitting to the synthetic data distribution being trained on. Thus, it mitigates the domain gap and achieves satisfactory results on real data.

In other words, we create a number of invisible objects and save their coordinates in the camera space for each frame. In order to do so, for each frame a number of random points are sampled from the screen camera space. Then, a ray is cast from each of these points to infinity. At each ray’s intersection point with the scene, a hypothetical invisible object is created. The object remains stationary for a number of seconds before being destroyed. For each frame, the object position in world space is transferred to the camera space and saved in XML format.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are many photo-realistic synthetic data generators like CARLA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and UrbanScene3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> that can be used to simulate photo-realistic, diverse, and visually complex 3D worlds. However, generating special data in such engines is cumbersome and most importantly, they do not support generating training data for video stabilization. <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Silver</span>, on the other hand, fills the gap and generates the required training data for this task. Additionally, it supports other computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, depth estimation, pose estimation, surface normals estimation. However, in this paper, we limit our discussion to the usability of our engine for video stabilization task.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we show that more vital than photo-realistic and diverse 3D scenes is designing computer vision models targeted at using synthetic data, and generating the appropriate synthetic data for these models. In virtual worlds, it is not only easy to control all scene aspects but also to generate more suitable training data for supervised learning algorithms.</p>

<p id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our work deploys synthetic data to train a synthetic-aware video stabilization algorithm. For that aim, we developed <span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Silver</span> using the Unity game engine to generate our synthetic training datasets VSAC65Synth and VSNC35Synth. We employ the Procedural Content Generation (PCG) concept to create a full 3D virtual world at run-time while the system’s extensibility is attained by taking advantage of the modular approach followed as we built the system from scratch. Although our simulator can provide clean, unbiased, and large-scale training and testing data for various computer vision tasks, we focus on the video stabilization task.
A shaky synthetic video is recorded after procedurally creating a 3D virtual world sampled from a predefined set of 3D models, materials, and animations. Note that for each video, a new virtual world is created to diversify the training data. A simplified flowchart describing the scene creation process is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Simulator ‣ 4 Silver: Framework for Generating Synthetic Data for Computer Vision Tasks ‣ Leveraging Synthetic Data to Learn Video Stabilization Under Adverse Conditions The paper is under review." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

In this part, first the street length and the number of crosses are set at random.
Following this, the buildings are created where buildings’ locations,
types, and frequency are set at random. After that, the other scene
elements like benches, trash containers and bags, trees, and other
elements are created. To further improve the realism and diversity of the generated scenes, we introduce a new variable called <span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Anomaly Rate</span>; higher values will cause more artifacts to appear in the scene such as more street lights being off at night, more being on at daytime, and some trash bags being on roads.</p>

<p id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Once the static part of the scene is completed, the dynamic part of the scene is initiated. Initially, the characters generator retrieves the locations of buildings and benches, and instantiates characters based on the required characters density.
The Microsoft Rocketbox Avatar Library <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> is used to define the
character avatar, and the animations are selected based on character pose (standing or sitting). Character animations were adopted from Mixamo. In a similar way, the cars are created. However, number of cars and models are selected at random. Additionally, car shader attributes: Smoothness, Metallic, and BaseColour are all randomized at run-time to give different visual appearance even to the same car model. After that, the plates of the cars are selected at random from a large set collected manually from the web. The main processes are summarized in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Simulator ‣ 4 Silver: Framework for Generating Synthetic Data for Computer Vision Tasks ‣ Leveraging Synthetic Data to Learn Video Stabilization Under Adverse Conditions The paper is under review." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
In parallel to that, the first-person videos are recorded using Cinemachine camera behaviour from Unity, attached to an AI navigation agent. We use Cinemachine since it gives unlimited sets of behaviours that enrich the diversity of the generated synthetic data in terms of the camera view angle and transition.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Video Stabilization Methods ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Leveraging Synthetic Data to Learn Video Stabilization Under Adverse Conditions The paper is under review." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the results of comparing our method to several video stabilization approaches. As can be seen, our method presented the best values on average in comparison to all the baselines in terms of stability average, distortion, cropping ratio, and success rate.
Even though our method did not surpass the baselines at each class individually, it still achieved competitive results. Every baseline performs badly in at least one class, while our method is more robust across classes, hence holding the final best results on the VSAC105Real.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Preserving the content while compensating for camera shakiness is another important feature of our algorithm. Our method achieved the best results as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The superiority of our method can be linked to the accurate affine transformation matrix estimation and the smoothing stage. Moreover, our method achieved the highest success rate compared to the competitors as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Video Stabilization Methods ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Leveraging Synthetic Data to Learn Video Stabilization Under Adverse Conditions The paper is under review." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. It is worth noting that all baselines failed to stabilize most of the shaky videos at foggy weather conditions. The reason for this outcome is that participating media, like fog, work as a low pass filter that removes high-quality features that most videos stabilization algorithms depend on to estimate the camera trajectory. We highlight that even though our model was not trained on any samples under the foggy weather condition, it was capable of learning useful features from both raw images and optical flow.</p>

Our model achieves comparable results to other methods while maintaining the best distortion score as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Evaluation Metrics ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Leveraging Synthetic Data to Learn Video Stabilization Under Adverse Conditions The paper is under review." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

First, since we use two networks in our pipeline, we trained using a single CNN with four losses: horizontal translation loss, vertical translation loss, rotation loss, and scale loss. As a result, the network was unable to converge well. One problem could be that the translation losses were larger than others. However, even after applying weights for the losses to make them comparable to each other, the network could not learn well (column <span id="S6.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Single Network</span> in Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 6.3 Ablation Study ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Leveraging Synthetic Data to Learn Video Stabilization Under Adverse Conditions The paper is under review." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>).</p>

Standard feature extractors like SIFT struggle to extract reliable and robust features under adverse conditions. Rain and snow particles, low illumination at night, and foggy weather make finding and matching features rather hard.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We showed that most of the state-of-the-art video stabilization methods could not perform well under adverse weather conditions. We proposed a novel synthetic-aware video stabilization algorithm that requires only synthetic data for training. Our experimental results demonstrated that our method surpasses all other baselines. We also provided one real dataset (VSAC105Real) for video stabilization under adverse conditions and two synthetic datasets (VSNC35Synth and VSAC65Synth) for training purposes.
Our ablation studies demonstrated that current affine transformation matrix estimation methods fail under challenging conditions. Despite the fact that repetitive textures caused by rain and snowdrops, along with smoothing filters caused by fog and the absence of enough features at night altogether, pose certain challenges on current video stabilization algorithms, our video stabilization performed well under these challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although our approach achieved state-of-the-art results, it has a few limitations. Increasing the number of synthetic training samples did not boost the performance of our video stabilization method. The reason could be that our model has already learned how to estimate the affine transformation matrix, and any further training videos were not advantageous. At the same time, our affine estimation model did not perform well under straightforward scenarios such as large-foreground images. Additionally, it achieved comparable results on selfie video dataset. That is due to the fact that our generated synthetic dataset did not include any selfie videos. Even though, our video stabilization algorithm obtained satisfactory results. Hence, we have demonstrated that synthetic data can be very useful, but not only as an additional data source, as how it was usually expected, but also as an essential element for novel synthetic-aware computer vision algorithms.
