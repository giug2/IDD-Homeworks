<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), an effective distributed machine learning framework, implements model training and meanwhile protects local data privacy.
It has been applied to a broad variety of practical areas due to their great performance and appreciable profits.
<em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Who really owns the model, and how to protect the copyright</em> has become a real problem.
Intuitively, the existing property rights protection methods in centralized scenarios (e.g., watermark embedding and model fingerprints) are possible solutions for FL.
But they are still challenged by the distributed nature of FL in aspects of the no data sharing, parameter aggregation, and federated training settings.
For the first time we formalize the problem of copyright protection for FL, and propose FedRight to protect model copyright based on model fingerprints, i.e., extracting model features by generating adversarial examples as model fingerprints. FedRight outperforms previous works in four key aspects:
(i) <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Validity</em> - it extracts model features to generate transferable fingerprints to train a detector to verify the copyright of the model.
(ii) <em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Fidelity</em> - it is with imperceptible impact on the federated training, thus promises good main task performance.
(iii) <em id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Robustness</em> - it is empirically robust against malicious attack on copyright protection, i.e., fine-tuning, model pruning and adaptive attacks.
(iv) <em id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Black-box</em> - it is valid in black-box forensic scenario where only application programming interface calls to the model are available.
Extensive evaluations across 3 datasets and 9 model structures demonstrate FedRight’s superior fidelity, validity and robustness.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is an emerging distributed learning framework for user data privacy protection.
In the federated learning scenario, there are usually one server and multiple clients.
Depending on the specific application, it can be divided into horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning and transferable federated learning.
Horizontal federated learning (HFL) is the most popular one among them.
The client trains a local model with locally collected data, and then only uploads the model information to the server.
The server generates a global model with aggregation algorithms by aggregating the model information uploaded by clients, and distributes the global model back to the client for further training in an iterative manner.
The raw training data are safely kept in the local client during the whole training process.
Thus the FL successfully maintains the privacy of clients’ training data, meanwhile implements the distributed training whose accuracy is comparable to that of the centralized training.
Due to its privacy-preserving nature and efficient distributed training mechanism, FL has been widely applied to practical scenarios such as bank loans <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, medical diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and recommendation systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, there lacks a proper method to protect the copyright of the FL-trained model.
This problem directly leads to the difficulty for the owner of the model to claim the copyright even if the model is suspected to be illegally used by others for profit.
How to better protect the property rights of the model and interests of the participants is an urgent issue that needs to be solved.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are a number of existing methods for model copyright protection in the centralized scenario.
Watermark embedding  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and model fingerprinting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> are the two mainstream model ownership verifications.
They require the model owner to embed a unique secret watermark or generate a unique secret fingerprint before releasing the model.
When it comes to the situation where the model owner needs to claim the ownership of the model, the owner can use the secret watermark or fingerprint in combination with the behavior of the suspect model to prove so.
However, embedding the watermark needs to change the model parameters, the process inevitably affects the performance and efficiency of the main task of federated training.
Model fingerprints methods extract model features (e.g., gradients) to generate an adversarial example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and use the transferability of the generated adversarial examples to determine whether the use of the suspect model is unauthorized. However, fingerprints are easily erased by adversarial retraining <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the centralized training, FL is distributed and involved different parties such as the server and the clients.
However, according the assumption of the FL, a client may not be trustworthy but a server is, i.e., a trusted and honest server in FL.
Therefore, it is more rational to rely the copyright protection on the server side than on the client side.
However, there are still challenges to directly migrate the centralized copyright protection to FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We summarize the main challenges addressed for the model copyright protection in FL:
(i) <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Data limitation</em> - An honest server cannot access the training data owned by the clients to make watermarks or model fingerprints.
(ii) <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Accuracy sacrifice</em> - The protection should not excessively sacrifice the server model’s accuracy, as well as the FL’s training efficiency.
(iii) <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Malicious attacks</em> - The protection method at the server side needs to deal with downstream attacks, i.e. fine-tuning, model pruning, etc., as well as malicious clients upstream in collaborative training.
(iv) <em id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Black-box ownership verification</em> - The model copyright verification should be practical for black-box ownership verification scenario (i.e., without any knowledge of the model’s architecture or parameters), for example, only Application Programming Interface (API) calls to query the suspect model are available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we propose FedRight, the first approach proposing to use model fingerprints to protect model copyright in FL.
FedRight is based on model fingerprints techniques but with improved robust against adversarial retraining attacks.
Generally, we rely on the honest FL server to generate fingerprints for the FL-trained model and train a separate model using these fingerprints and their outputs.
Specifically, by using secret key samples, the server leverages on the extracted global model features and generates a set of adversarial examples as model fingerprints.
Note that the key samples here are not necessarily of the same distribution with the training or testing samples.
Then we use these fingerprints as input to the model and obtain the feature distributions of these fingerprints.
The feature distribution of the key samples is used to train a new model, i.e., the detector, which is to predict the ground-truth class encode of the key samples.
When testing a suspect model, we obtain the feature distribution of the key samples output by the suspect model, and use the detector to predict the key samples’ ground-truth class.
When the accuracy of the detector exceeds a threshold, the ownership of the model is claimed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, FedRight has designed the model fingerprint to have adaptive enhancement capability.
It gradually adds model features in response to the changes in the global model during federation training.
During the verification phase, FedRight only accesses the model’s output of key samples, which is suitable for the black-box forensic scenarios.
We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the validity, fidelity, efficiency and robustness of FedRight.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing means of intellectual property (IP) protection are mainly applied to the deep neural network (DNN) in centralized scenarios.
There are two streams of IP protection methods, i.e., watermarking and fingerprinting.
Since Uchida et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> first proposed a watermarking model framework in a white-box scenario.
It gets further upgraded in the face of the restrictions on access rights in the black-box scenario.
Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> combine common data samples with exclusive “logos” and train models to predict them as specific labels so that the ownership of the model can be verified by a third party.
Jia et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> propose entangled watermark embedding to address watermark removal attacks.
In order to be robust against copyright evasion attacks, Zheng Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> propose a blind watermarking method to generate key samples with a distribution similar to the original samples.
However, embedding watermarks changes the model parameters and this process inevitably affects the performance of the main task of the model.
Fingerprinting is another IP protection that does not change the model parameters.
Zhao <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, Lukas et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> used adversarial examples as model fingerprints and exploited their transferability to verify model IP rights.
Fingerprinting methods generate model fingerprints by extracting model features, hence there is no impact on the model performance.
However, model fingerprints can be removed in the face of adaptive adversarial retraining attacks. Moreover, the privacy-preserving nature of FL, where there is no training data available, poses great challenge to the fingerprinting process on the server.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The mainstream IP protection in FL is still based on watermarking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, Tekgul et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed WAFFLE which achieves IP protection by embedding watermarks on the server.
Bowen Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed FedIPR which embeds and detects watermarks by each client independently.
Fang et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> designed the Merkle-Sign watermarking framework, which combines the state-of-the-art watermarking scheme and a security mechanism designed for distributed storage to protect both privacy and ownership.
However, they either surfer the inherent limitation of the watermarking scheme or pose changes to the training of federated learning, both of which lead to negative impact on the model performance.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Malicious attacks may launch attacks aiming at obtaining the model without degrading its accuracy, and meanwhile preventing the model owner from proving his/her ownership.
There are model modification methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, copyright evasion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, and removal attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
The model modification includes model fine-tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, model pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, model compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and model retraining <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
In order to evade the legitimate owner’s verification, in the copyright evasion attack against IP protection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the attacker will try to construct a detector to detect whether the queried sample is a clean or possibly critical sample. Once the detector determines that the queried instance is a possible critical sample, the stolen model will return a random label.
Removal attacks, the attackers attempt to remove the watermark. Shafieinejad et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> studied removal attacks based on backdoor watermarking schemes and proposed a method to detect whether a model contains a watermark.
Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> used generative adversarial network (GAN) to detect and reverse the backdoor trigger in the model and then fine-tune the model with the reversed trigger to remove the backdoor based watermark.
Chattopadhyay et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> used GAN to generate samples for retraining that can obtain a model with similar performance while removing the watermark.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Key samples are the seeds to generate model fingerprints.
Key samples are normally protected from attackers’ access.
Existing model protection methods generate fingerprints using key samples from training data.
However, this could be an issue in FL since the server in FL does not have access to client data, so it cannot use the training data as key samples.
If the key samples are part of the training data, attackers are prone to use the adversarial retraining attack of training data to eliminate fingerprints.
Therefore, the key samples used in this paper are independent of the training data.
This could 1) fits in the FL scenario where training data are not available; and 2) greatly affects the main task performance if the attacker performs retraining attack.

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Using non-training data as key samples can also generate valid model fingerprints because FedRight’s model fingerprints consist of key samples and model-specific features. Specifically, the key sample is only the carrier of the model fingerprint, which depends critically on the extracted model-specific features. Thus, FedRight proposes an effective method for generating fingerprints without training data.</p>

Since the model fingerprint, i.e., the adversarial example, has transferability, the model ownership can still be verified even though the suspect model is slightly modified from the original model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Existing model fingerprint verification algorithms only using prediction labels are vulnerable to ambiguity attacks, where a fake owner uses samples with the same output label as the original model fingerprints to falsely claim the model ownership.
For example, the model owner is considered to have ownership of the model using a key sample output label ‘1’. However, the attacker uses a non-key sample output label also ‘1’, which is an eventuality and makes the ownership of the model confusing.
We take this into account when designing our fingerprint verification algorithm.
We use the output distribution features of the model instead of prediction label only, which will be detailed in Section <a href="#S5.SS4" title="5.4 IP Verification ‣ 5 Methodology ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.4</span></a>.</p>

A rational assumption would be 1) the defender has the white-box access to the model to be protected, since he/she owns the copyright; 2) the defender only has black-box access to the suspect model deployed by others.</p>

An overview of FedRight is shown in Fig.<a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.4 Model Fingerprints ‣ 3 Preliminaries and Background ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
The overall process is consisted of two phases, i.e., fingerprints generation and copyright verification. Specifically, the first phase is divided into three steps:
\scriptsize{1}⃝ generate adversarial examples as model fingerprints;
\scriptsize{2}⃝ obtain the output distribution features of the model fingerprints and label them with specific labels;
\scriptsize{3}⃝ detector training.
The verification phase happens when there is a suspect model and the model owner intends to verify the ownership of the model.
The owner needs to obtain the feature distribution of the fingerprint samples by querying the suspect model.
Then the obtained distribution is fed to our detector to see whether the prediction accuracy is high enough to claim the model’s ownership.</p>

In the linear growth process, the model just keeps converging the intra-class distance and increasing the inter-class distance. We infer that there are fewer features that can be provided to the model fingerprint at this time, and therefore the MSE value of the model fingerprint remains essentially unchanged.
To sum up, the model fingerprint we propose is directly related to the global model, for which the global model is unique.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the timing of model fingerprints generation, some options are possible, such as generating fingerprints during the training process or after the training.
If the generation of model fingerprints starts at the end of federated training, since the client gets the global model published by the server in each epoch of training, then it is possible for the malicious client to save the global models of previous epochs locally to evade IP verification.
Therefore, the generation of model fingerprints needs to be performed during the federated training.
The other way is considering the model fingerprint generated from the beginning to the end of the whole federated training. It still brings some problems, not only to consider the time overhead of IP protection, but also at the early stage of training, the parameters of the global model change sharply with the iterative update in FL, thus the model fingerprint generated in the previous epoch to be input to the global model in the next epoch of training will lead the target label shifted, resulting in great change in the output distribution vector, i.e., the model fingerprint is invalid.
As shown in Fig.<a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.1 Model Fingerprints Generation ‣ 5 Methodology ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a),
we randomly select the model fingerprint with target label ‘5’ generated in epoch 50 and show the visualization of its output distribution vector in epochs 50 to 52.
It can be found that the model fingerprint generated in epoch 50 has been invalidated in the subsequent epochs.
It indicates that the static generation method is difficult to maintain the validity of fingerprints in dynamic training.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of FedRight.
The purpose is to measure whether we can successfully verify the ownership of the target model under the protection of FedRight.
We test DMC between the IP models and the non-IP models(i.e., models that are not under our ownership). In this case, the non-IP models were centrally trained with the same training data and model structure as the IP models. The detector <math id="S7.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S7.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">M</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S7.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">M</annotation></semantics></math> is used to validate these models and to evaluate the final DMC.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The results show that the detector effectively identifies the feature distribution of model fingerprints and predicts them to predefined labels with high accuracy.
As shown in Fig.<a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.1 RQ1: Validity ‣ 7 Evaluation and Analysis ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, all non-IP models only achieve an accuracy of 8.80%-18.40%, which is at about the same level of random guessing, i.e., the FedRight does not falsely claim ownership of non-IP models.
In contrast, FedRight is encouragingly shown to achieve 100% accuracy on models that declare IP rights.
The reason is that each declared IP model has the unique model fingerprint, and using its output vector to train the detector can effectively predict it in the subsequent validation process with high accuracy to avoid misclassification.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PruningAtt.</span> It is well known that DNNs have many layers and many parameters, leading to the possible existence of redundant parameters.
Therefore, a plagiarist can use PruningAtt to cut some redundant parameters and obtain a new model that is different from the original model but still has similar accuracy.
Using a PruningAtt algorithm, some percentage of the parameters with the smallest absolute value is set to 0. The experiments compress the parameters by 30% to 90% with an interval of 10%. We then evaluate the accuracy of the model using the original test data to determine the impact on the original functionality of the model and also to assess the impact on FedRight.

It can be seen that as the PruningAtt pruning percentage increases, it seriously affects the main task performance. Although the verification accuracy of the corresponding detector also gradually decreases, it still has the verification capability when the IP model still has high accuracy.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Even though some DMC of the detector has fallen below the threshold, we can see that the global model itself has also become of no value at that time.
For example, for the three models on the CIFAR-10 dataset, when the global model is pruned by 90%, the DMC is lowered to 10% which is not able to determine the ownership anymore. However, the global model accuracy drops to 10% at the same time, which is of no meaning to protect.</p>

Besides, we study how the number of malicious clients affects the FedRight, and we find that the number of malicious clients does not affect our IP statement of the global model.
Unlike the watermark embedding technique, most malicious clients can effectively remove the watermark embedded in the global model. In the FedRight framework, however, all the attacks done by the clients will only affect the performance of the global model, and the detector will be dynamically trained according to the changes in the global model to achieve the IP protection.</p>

<p id="S7.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">RQ1 answers that FedRight has a natural advantage in terms of fidelity. To better confirm its fidelity, we performed a comparative evaluation of the watermark embedding techniques-WAFFLE and FedRight. The results are shown in Fig.<a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7.4.1 Impact on Main Performance ‣ 7.4 RQ4: Comparison with Watermarking Technology ‣ 7 Evaluation and Analysis ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, FedRight shows the same level of global model accuracy as the normal FL model, while the accuracy of the watermarked FL model decreases by 0.94 % on average.
The reason is that our FedRight IP protection is independent of the federated training process and does not have any impact on FL. The embedding of watermark changes the training settings of FL and needs to embed the watermark image into the global model.
Although with the development of technology, the impact from watermarking technology on the main task performance is gradually reduced, it is still difficult to eliminate this inherent defect.</p>

As shown in Fig.<a href="#S7.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 7.4.2 Time Overhead ‣ 7.4 RQ4: Comparison with Watermarking Technology ‣ 7 Evaluation and Analysis ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>,
it can be observed intuitively that WAFFLE has changed the settings of the federated training. The server needs to embed the watermark after each epoch of aggregation operation, and then distribute the global model to each client.
WAFFLE is at the expense of the main task training performance and efficiency.
Differently, FedRight does not have any impact on the main task training, and the model fingerprinting is independent of the FL training.
In Table <a href="#S7.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 7.4.2 Time Overhead ‣ 7.4 RQ4: Comparison with Watermarking Technology ‣ 7 Evaluation and Analysis ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> we give the detailed time overhead added by the two copyright protection mechanisms for federated training. WAFFLE adds an average of 1983.89 seconds of time overhead for all models.
The time added on training a large dataset such as CIFAR100 is even more significant, with an average increase of 3608.68 seconds.</p>

Facing the removal attack, the overall watermark verification accuracy of WAFFLE has been lowered to less than 30%.
Even worse, the verification has been failed on the CIFAR-100-based model.
The reason may be that for the main task with more data classes, the difficulty of embedding watermarks may increase, leading to easier attacks.</p>

because the parameters of the global model are updated in each training epoch, the FedRight<sub id="S7.SS4.SSS3.p4.8.5" class="ltx_sub">S</sub> may cause the fingerprints generated in the previous epoch to be invalid in the next epoch without adaptive capability. The FedRight<sub id="S7.SS4.SSS3.p4.8.6" class="ltx_sub">D</sub>, on the other hand, effectively solves this problem. The validity of the model fingerprint is checked using Algorithm <a href="#S5.E4" title="In 5.2 Model Fingerprinting Adaptive Enhancement ‣ 5 Methodology ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> so that the model features of the current epoch can be added adaptively to achieve an enhanced fingerprint.
This makes the overall verification accuracy of FedRight<sub id="S7.SS4.SSS3.p4.8.7" class="ltx_sub">D</sub> higher than FedRight<sub id="S7.SS4.SSS3.p4.8.8" class="ltx_sub">S</sub> by 11.32% and 4.05% on average, respectively, in the face of FtuningAtt and PruningAtt.</p>

From Table <a href="#S7.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 7.5.1 Number of Clients ‣ 7.5 RQ5: Parameter Sensitivity ‣ 7 Evaluation and Analysis ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, it can be intuitively found that the different number of clients in FL training mainly affects the global model accuracy GMC, and has no effect on the detector verification accuracy DMC. In Table <a href="#S7.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ 7.5.1 Number of Clients ‣ 7.5 RQ5: Parameter Sensitivity ‣ 7 Evaluation and Analysis ‣ FedRight: An Effective Model Copyright Protection for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, even in the training scenario with client K=100, AdaptiveAtt does not lead to the failure of the detector verification. The reason is that the number of clients mainly affects the global model, while the detector will train according to the changes in the global model as a way to achieve IP protection.
Therefore, when FL training involves a large number of clients, the effectiveness of the detector can still be ensured.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the widespread use of federated learning, the federated models are becoming more and more commercially valuable, and how to protect the property rights of federated models and prevent illegal profits after copying and stealing has practical significance. Our proposed FedRight framework can be effectively applied to several real-world scenarios, such as news recommendation systems, which have high business value and people benefit from personalized push messages from the recommendation system to meet their needs. In the FedRight framework, each user is a participant and the central server is the initiator of the IP declaration, which dynamically trains the detector according to the changes of the recommender system to achieve property rights protection.</p>

<div id="S9.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents FedRight, the FL copyright protection technique based on model fingerprints.
FedRight uses the features of the model to generate the model fingerprints with adaptive enhancement.
Using the distribution features of the model fingerprint input by the model, a detector is trained to claim the ownership of a suspect model.
FedRight does not require any training data, which is especially designed for FL scenario.
Moreover, FedRight only requires the input and output of the suspect model to verify the copyright, which fits the practical situation where model owner does not have access to the deployed stolen model.
We extensively evaluate FedRight on nine models on three benchmark datasets to demostrate that it achieves remarkable results in terms of fidelity, effectiveness, and robustness.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply model fingerprints techniques to FL.
In future work, we plan to adapt FedRight to other high-value models such as speech recognition, and extend to other forms of deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S9.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is interesting and challenging to verify the attribution of the model by comparing the features of the suspicious model and the original model, and it has important implications for future research, which we will investigate in our future work.
Meanwhile, more comprehensively consider the case where the client is the initiator of property protection and the server has the possibility of being maliciously controlled.</p>
