<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) training often necessitates gathering raw user data on a central server, which raises significant privacy concerns. Federated learning emerges as a solution, enabling collaborative model training without users directly sharing their raw data. However, integrating federated learning with GNNs presents unique challenges, especially when a client represents a graph node and holds merely a single feature vector. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for node-level federated graph learning. Specifically, we decouple the message-passing and feature vector transformation processes of the first GNN layer, allowing them to be executed separately on the user devices and the cloud server. Moreover, we introduce a graph Laplacian term based on the feature vector’s latent representation to regulate the user-side model updates. The experiment results on multiple datasets show that our approach achieves better performance compared with baselines.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted significant attention both within academic circles and across diverse industries. Their remarkable achievements span a multitude of domains, including fraud detection in social networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, cancer classification in biology science <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and materials design in molecular chemistry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In real-world applications, graph data tied to individuals or human behaviors often contains sensitive details. For example, the user’s comments, friend list, and profiles on a social platform, as well as their purchase records, browsing history, and transactions on an economic network, are typically deemed private. With increasing emphasis on user privacy, legal restrictions like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe (EU) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the US have rendered data-sharing practices infeasible. However, the conventional graph machine learning paradigm requires uploading raw user data to a central server. This is infeasible due to privacy restrictions, hindering the deployment of many real-world graph-based applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> offers a collaborative learning method, allowing multiple clients to train a model without revealing their raw training data. The workflow of FL follows an iterative training procedure, including multiple communication rounds between the clients and a central server. Specifically, the central server maintains a global model and orchestrates the training process. In each round, the selected clients fetch the global model and perform several epochs of updating using their local training data. The updated local model is later uploaded to the server to produce the latest global model. The training process terminated until the model meets the pre-defined criteria.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some efforts have recently been devoted to training GNN models over graph data with the preservation of user privacy. One straightforward approach is extending FL to graph machine learning. Depending on the available data possessed by the clients, these research studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> assume either graph-level FL, where multiple graphs are distributed among clients, or subgraph-level FL, where a big graph is partitioned into several subgraphs and each client has access to the subgraph. With at least one (sub)-graph possessed by the client, local training could proceed as standard FL algorithm plus certain adaptations (e.g., missing link retrieve) tailored for graph data. Note these methods fail under node-level data availability, where each client only possesses data of one node locally (one feature vector). Another line of research work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> aims to mitigate the privacy risk by introducing Differential-Private (DP) noise to user data, and the model training process follows the conventional machine learning paradigm. As the added DP noise inevitably degrades the quality of training data, this approach suffers from an inherent privacy-performance trade-off. Consequently, the potential of the GNNs to achieve better performance is restricted. In summary, fewer prior works (see Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Related Work ‣ One Node Per User: Node-Level Federated Learning for Graph Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a> for detailed related work) have explored training GNNs under node-level user data privacy protection.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Motivating Example.</span>
As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ One Node Per User: Node-Level Federated Learning for Graph Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our motivating example showcases how industries often use graphs wherein each node represents an individual user. Take mobile social networks as an instance: here, a node represents a mobile user, and an edge signifies the social ties between them. These platforms are interested in using additional user data in user’s mobile devices, such as users’ locations, activity records, and app usage histories, to perform tasks such as Sybil detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, online advertisements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and recommendations of social media content <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Similarly, telecom giants such as AT<math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\&amp;" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">&amp;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><and id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1"></and></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">\&amp;</annotation></semantics></math>T and Spectrum possess vast amounts of phone call logs between users. These logs can be depicted as a graph where each node symbolizes a user, and an edge indicates a call record shared between two users. To enhance user experience, these companies might desire access to richer user datasets, such as users’ app usage statistics, geolocation data, and device sensor information. Such details are instrumental in understanding user preferences and needs.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenges.</span> Implementing node-level FL within GNNs presents several unique challenges. Foremost, each user’s training data is remarkably limited, consisting merely of one feature vector. This is different from existing FL settings, where each client has enough data (a graph or sub-graph) to train a local model. Moreover, the graph-based node classification task belongs to the transductive learning (semi-supervised learning) regime, wherein the unlabeled nodes also contribute to the model training. However, conventional FL algorithms such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> inherently assume user data to be labeled (or partially labeled). It is untrivial to integrate the knowledge from unlabeled nodes (clients) into the GNNs under the node-level FL setting.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a node-level FL framework for GNNs, termed <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">nFedGNN</span>.

Importantly, this feature vector remains localized throughout the training, ensuring no external disclosure. Moreover, we assume that the server has labeled some nodes, and the learning objective is to assign the label for the unlabeled nodes. We also assume the central server has access to the graph topology. Note the research community usually believes the graph topology is private in graph-level and subgraph-level FL. However, under node-level data availability of the client, it is unnecessary to consider the privacy of the graph topology. As illustrated in the motivating example, this assumption aligns with many real-world GNN applications.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Key ideas of our solution.</span>
To facilitate GNN training across distributed users, our method involves splitting the GNN model between the clients and the server, similar to the technique used in split learning or vertical federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Specifically, the user-side model processes the local private feature vector, yielding a latent representation vector. Subsequently, the server gathers these latent vectors and integrates them with graph topology through the server-side model. To update the client-side model, the server computes the gradient of the latent representation vectors and transmits it back to the clients. The entire training process needs multiple communication rounds until the model meets the predefined criteria. We conducted a preliminary experiment, and the result shows this approach is prone to overfitting, leading to subpar generalization performance.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We analyze the potential causes and conclude that the user-side model of labeled nodes easily fits their local data. To address this, we introduce an explicit graph regularization loss <math id="S1.p8.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="L_{\text{reg}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p8.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">L</mi><mtext id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3a.cmml">reg</mtext></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p8.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐿</ci><ci id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3a.cmml" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p8.1.m1.1.1.3">reg</mtext></ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p8.1.m1.1c">L_{\text{reg}}</annotation></semantics></math> based on the received latent vectors. Our solution is motivated by the fundamental assumption of graph-based semi-supervised learning: connected nodes in a graph are likely to share the same label <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. This implies that connected nodes are likely to share a similar node embedding. In the preliminary experiment, this assumption is broken as each user-side model has enough flexibility in its embedding. The regularization loss imposes constraints on the distribution of latent representations, effectively limiting the degree of freedom in the latent space. Consequently, the user-side model is not only required to fit its own local data but also has a strong motivation to learn from its neighbors. As a result, the learned model achieves better performance.
We conducted the experiment on several datasets using split GCN and GAT models. The experiment result shows that nFedGNN significantly surpasses the baselines. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We train the split GCN model on the Cora dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to assess the performance of the <span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">nFedGNN</span>. The training curves are shown in Fig.(<a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Preliminary Evaluation ‣ 3 The Proposed Method ‣ One Node Per User: Node-Level Federated Learning for Graph Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). From the figure, we can observe that the training loss quickly decreases after only a few rounds of updating and then does not change much, and improvement in testing accuracy is only seen in the first few rounds. We also plot the testing accuracy of the GCN in the centralized training setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> as reference. Although the proposed method works, the final testing accuracy still leaves room for improvement.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We examine the internal state of the GNN model after splitting. In nFedGNN, we instantiate a local model for every node in the graph. For the user who possesses the labeled node, their local model only undergoes minor adjustments (as the local data is extremely scarce) to fit the local feature vector during training. Consequently, the local model of a labeled user rapidly adapts to their local data, diminishing the training loss to a near-zero value. However, the user-side model from the unlabeled nodes still remains un-updated.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the performance of nFedGNN, we revisited the foundational assumption of graph-based semi-supervised learning: the connected nodes in the graph are likely to share the same label <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. If two nodes are connected in the graph, a properly trained GNN model is likely to assign the same label to them. This suggests that the latent representations of two connected nodes should become increasingly similar as the model’s layers become deeper, even if they have distinct feature vectors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Drawing from this observation, in the context of the split GNN model, if two users are interconnected, their respective latent representations should ideally manifest analogous patterns. However, as discussed previously, the user-side model is only responsible for one feature vector locally. Consequently, the node’s latent representation shares less similarity with neighbor nodes. If we restrict the distribution of latent representations and let the connected users have a similar latent representation, the performance of the learned model should be improved. Motivated by this, we introduce the graph Laplacian regularization based on the received latent representations:</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Graph Regularization:</span> Graph regularization-based approach has a long history and is widely used for various applications. It’s noteworthy that the state-of-the-art GNN models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> relax the assumption behind the regularization-based approaches, where the connected nodes in the graph are likely to share the same label. Instead, they directly encode the topology with the feature matrix by a neural network, as the graph topology does not necessarily encode similarity but contains the information that does not appear in the feature matrix <math id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="X" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">X</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑋</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p1.1.m1.1c">X</annotation></semantics></math>. Nevertheless, this assumption still holds for a large portion of nodes within the graph, a fact evidenced by the success of regularization-based strategies. In nFedGNN, we use the graph Laplacian regularization to restrict the distribution of latent representation from the user-side model. The remaining layers of the GNN model (located on the server side) still encode the graph topology with the (latent)-feature matrix as the state-of-the-art GNN model. Consequently, the model still utilizes the knowledge from graph topology as state-of-the-art GNNs.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Communication Cost:</span> In cross-device federated learning environments, the communication bottleneck is one of the major concerns in prior graph-level and subgraph-level FL researches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, within nFedGNN, the data exchanged between the user and server each round consists solely of a latent representation vector and a corresponding gradient vector, as opposed to the entire model parameter. Typically, the length of the latent representation vector is in the range of tens to hundreds depending on the tasks and models, substantially smaller compared to the total count of neural network parameters. Thus, within the framework of nFedGNN, communication cost does not pose as a constraining factor.</p>

However, their focus is traffic prediction using time-series user data, employing an encoder-decoder architecture in their user-side model to handle sequence data, rendering their model and algorithm incompatible with our setting. Nonetheless, we adapt their conceptual framework by allowing users to upload both the model parameter and the latent vector, with the server subsequently averaging the received local models and broadcasting the updated global model to all users. It’s important to note that their approach simultaneously uploads the local model and the latent representation, significantly increasing the risk of privacy leakage.

Although there is still a gap between nFedGNN and the centralized GNN model in testing accuracy, it is significantly reduced compared with the baseline and the no regularization counterpart. Note our goal is not to achieve the state-of-the-art but to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It is worth noting that CNFGNN needs to transmit the extra local model parameters between the users and server at every FL round, necessitating more communication resources.

This includes the cumulative communication cost spanning 200 training rounds for all users within the graph, with the data transmitted in float32 format. For nFedGNN, we record the size of the latent feature vector. For CNFGNN, we record the size of the latent feature vector and the number of user-side model parameters. In all cases, nFedGNN consumes less communication resources than CNFGNN. Moreover, the total transmitted data size is very small, verifying the conclusion that communication cost is not the bottleneck for our method.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce nFedGNN, a novel federated learning algorithm for GNNs where each user only has access to the data of a single node. Our method provides an opportunity to utilize the distributed graph data without compromising user privacy. We compare nFedGNN with nFedGNN over multiple datasets and demonstrate the advantage of our method. Despite our extensive efforts, we recognize the limitations in the scope of our study. For example, we have not explored the training on larger datasets and inductive frameworks like GraphSage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In the future, we will extend nFedGNN to adopt partial user participation and to provide rigorous privacy protection (e.g., differential privacy).</p>

The goal of FL is to allow multiple users to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server without sharing their raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In conventional FL algorithms such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, model training takes place on the user side, and only the model or model update is transferred between the user and a server. An aggregator on the server subsequently aggregates the models from the users for the next training round. In FL, the user’s raw data is never shared.</p>

In conventional FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the user has different data samples, while the samples from different users share the same feature space. In VFL, the user owns a common sample space, but disparate feature spaces. The first few layers of the model are partitioned width-wise to accommodate different feature spaces. Each user owns a portion of the whole model corresponding to their feature spaces. The user who possesses the labels holds the remaining layers of the model and coordinates the training process.</p>
</div>
<div id="A1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another relevant notion of FL is split learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Specifically, the model is partitioned layer-wise between the users and the server. Only the intermediate results, e.g., the activation maps and related gradients, are exchanged between the user and server during training. As opposed to FL, split learning requires users to communicate with the server every iteration, incurring heavy communication overhead and high training latency.</p>

Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> trains a missing neighbor generator to handle the missing edges of the subgraphs across users. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> employs the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) approach to tackle the Non-IID distributed data for the graph-based semi-supervised node classification task. Hu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> suggested an online adjustable attention mechanism to aggregate the local models. These prior works mainly focus on the setting that each user holds a graph/sub-graph, where a local GNN model could be independently trained and serves as a base model for FedAvg.</p>

<div id="A1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider a more challenging case where each user represents only one node in the graph and does not have access to other’s data. It is, in fact, a special but the most challenging case of subgraph-level FL and could not be addressed by any of the prior work. The closest work to ours is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. They consider the spatiotemporal dynamic modeling tasks and propose an approach that explicitly encodes the underlying graph structure using GNNs. Their approach is specifically crafted to fit the problem and may be unsuitable for general GNN tasks.</p>
