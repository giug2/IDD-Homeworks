<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we aim to answer questions based on images when provided with a dataset of question-answer pairs for a number of images during training. A number of methods have focused on solving this problem by using image based attention. This is done by focusing on a specific part of the image while answering the question. Humans also do so when solving this problem. However, the regions that the previous systems focus on are not correlated with the regions that humans focus on. The accuracy is limited due to this drawback. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem by using an exemplar based method. We obtain one or more supporting and opposing exemplars to obtain a differential attention region. This differential attention is closer to human attention than other image based attention methods. It also helps in obtaining improved accuracy when answering questions. The method is evaluated on challenging benchmark datasets. We perform better than other image based attention methods and are competitive with other state of the art methods that focus on both image and questions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Answering questions regarding images requires us to obtain an understanding about the image. We can gain insights into a method by observing the region of an image the method focuses on while answering a question. It has been observed in a recent work that humans also attend to specific regions of an image while answering questions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. We therefore expect strong correlation between focusing on the “right” regions while answering questions and obtaining better semantic understanding to solve the problem. This correlation exists as far as humans are concerned <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. We therefore aim in this paper to obtain image based attention regions that correlate better with human attention. We do that by obtaining a differential attention. The differential attention relies on an exemplar model of cognition.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In cognition studies, the exemplar theory suggests that humans are able to obtain generalisation for solving cognitive tasks by relying on an exemplar model. In this model, individuals compare new stimuli with the instances already stored in memory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and obtain answers based on these exemplars. We would like an exemplar model to provide attention. We want to focus on the specific parts in a nearest exemplar that distinguishes it from a far example. We do that by obtaining the differential attention region that distinguishes a supporting exemplar from an opposing exemplar. Our premise is that the difference between a nearest semantic exemplar and a far semantic exemplar can guide attention on a specific image region. We show that by using this differential attention mechanism we are able to obtain significant improvement in solving the visual question answering task. Further, we show that the obtained attention regions are more correlated with human attention regions both quantitatively and qualitatively. We evaluate this on the challenging VQA-1 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, VQA-2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and HAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite></p>

Given an image and an associated question, we use an attention network to combine the image and question to obtain a reference attention embedding. This is used to order the examples in the database. We obtain a near example as a supporting exemplar and a far example as an opposing exemplar. These are used to obtain a differential attention vector. We evaluate two variants of our approach, one we term as ‘differential attention network’ (DAN) where the supporting and opposing exemplars are used only to provide a better attention on the image. The other we term as ‘differential context network’ (DCN) that obtains a differential context feature. This is obtained from the difference between supporting and opposing exemplars with respect to the original image to provide a differential feature. The additional context is used in answering questions. Both variants improve results over the baseline with the differential context variant being better.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The problem of Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a recent problem that was initiated as a new kind of visual Turing test. The aim was to show progress of systems in solving even more challenging tasks as compared to the traditional visual recognition tasks such as object detection and segmentation. An initial work in this area was by Geman <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> that proposed this visual Turing test. Around the same time Malinowski <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a multi-world based approach to obtain questions and answer them from images. These works aimed at answering questions of a limited type. In this work we aim at answering free-form open-domain<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> questions as was attempted by later works.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An initial approach towards solving this problem in the open-domain form was by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. This was inspired by the work on neural machine translation that proposed translation as a sequence to sequence encoder-decoder framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. However, subsequent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> approached the problem as a classification problem using encoded embeddings. They used soft-max classification over an image embedding (obtained by a CNN) and a question embedding (obtained using an LSTM). Further work by Ma <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> varied the way to obtain an embedding by using CNNs to obtain both image and question embeddings. Another interesting approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> used dynamic parameter prediction where weights of the CNN model for the image embedding are modified based on the question embedding using hashing. These methods however, are not attention based. Use of attention enables us to focus on specific parts of an image or question that are pertinent for an instance and also offer valuable insight into the performance of the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There has been significant interest in including attention to solve the VQA problem. Attention based models comprises of image based attention models, question based attention and some that are both image and question based attention. In image based attention approach the aim is to use the question in order to focus attention over specific regions in an image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. An interesting recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> has shown that it is possible to repeatedly obtain attention by using stacked attention over an image based on the question. Our work is closely related to this work. There has been further work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> that considers a region based attention model over images. The image based attention has allowed systematic comparison of various methods as well as enabled analysis of the correlation with human attention models as shown by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In our approach we focus on image based attention using differential attention and show that it correlates better with image based attention. There has been a number of interesting works on question based attention as well <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. An interesting work obtains varied set of modules for answering questions of different types <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Recent work also explores joint image and question based hierarchical co-attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The idea of differential attention can also be explored through these approaches. However, we restrict ourselves to image based attention as our aim is to obtain a method that correlates well with human attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. There has been an interesting work by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> that advocates multimodal pooling and obtains state of the art in VQA. Interestingly, we show that by combining it with the proposed method further improves our results.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we adopt a classification framework that uses the image embedding combined with the question embedding to solve for the answer using a softmax function in a multiple choice setting. A similar setting is adopted in the Stacked Attention Network (SAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, that also aims at obtaining better attention and several other state-of-the-art methods. We provide two different variants for obtaining differential attention in the VQA system. We term the first variant a ‘Differential Attention Network’ (DAN) and the other a ‘Differential Context Network’ (DCN). We explain both the methods in the following sub-sections. A common requirement for both these tasks is to obtain nearest semantic exemplars.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our method, we use semantic nearest neighbors. Image level similarity does not suffice as the nearest neighbor may be visually similar but may not have the same context implied in the question (for instance, ‘Are the children playing?’ produces similar results for images with children based on visual similarity, whether the children are playing or not). In order to obtain semantic features we use a VQA system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to provide us with a joint image-question level embedding that relates meaningful exemplars. We compared image level features against the semantic nearest neighbors and observed that the semantic nearest neighbors were better. We used the semantic nearest neighbors in a k-nearest neighbor approach using a K-D tree data structure to represent the features. The ordering of the data-set features is based on the Euclidean distance. In section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Analysis of Network Parameters ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Differential Attention for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a> we provide the evaluation with several values of nearest neighbors that were used as supporting exemplars. For obtaining opposing exemplar we used a far neighbor that was an order of magnitude further than the nearest neighbor. This we obtained through a coarse quantization of training data into bins. We specified the opposing exemplar as one that was around 20 clusters away in a 50 cluster ordering. This parameter is not stringent and it only matters that the opposing exemplar be far from the supporting exemplar. We show that using these supporting and opposing exemplars aids the method and any random ordering adversely effects the method.</p>

The aim is to obtain attention weight vectors that bring the supporting exemplar attention close to the image attention and far from the opposing exemplar attention. The joint loss function used for training is given by:</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The experiments have been conducted using the two variants of differential attention that are proposed and compared against baselines on standard datasets. We first analyze the different parameters for the two variants DAN and DCN that are proposed. We further evaluate the two networks by comparing the networks with comparable baselines and evaluate the performance against the state of the art methods. The main evaluation is conducted to evaluate the performance in terms of correlation of attention with human correlation where we obtain state-of-the-art in terms of correlation with human attention. Further, we observe that its performance in terms of accuracy for solving the VQA task is substantially improved and is competitive with the current state of the art results on standard benchmark datasets. We also analyse the performance of the network on the recently proposed VQA2 dataset.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed DAN network, we have a dependency on the number of k-nearest neighbors that should be considered. We observe in table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.2 Differential Attention Network (DAN) ‣ 3 Method ‣ Differential Attention for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, that using 4 nearest neighbors in the triplet network we obtain the highest correlation with human attention as well as accuracy using VQA-1 dataset. We therefore use 4 nearest neighbors in our experiments. We observe that increasing nearest neighbors beyond 4 nearest neighbors results in reduction in accuracy. Further, even using a single nearest neighbor results in substantial improvement that is marginally improved as we move to 4 nearest neighbors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We also evaluate the effect of using the nearest neighbors as obtained through a baseline model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> versus using a random assignment of supporting and opposing exemplar. We observe that using DAN with a random set of nearest neighbors decreases the performance of the network. While comparing the network parameters, the comparable baseline we use is the basic model for VQA using LSTM and CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This however does not use attention and we evaluate this method with attention. With the best set of parameters the performance improves the correlation with human attention by 10.64%. We also observe that correspondingly the VQA performance improves by 4.1% over the comparable baseline. We further then incorporate this model with the model from MCB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> which is a state of the art VQA model. This further improves the result by 4.8% more on VQA and a further increase in correlation with human attention by 1.2%.</p>

We next evaluate the effect of using a fixed scaling weight (DCN_v1) for adding the differential context feature against learning a linear scaling weight (DCN_v2) for adding the differential context feature.

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We obtain the initial comparison with the baselines on the rank correlation on human attention (HAT) dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> that provides human attention by using a region deblurring task while solving for VQA. Between humans the rank correlation is 62.3%. The comparison of various state-of-the-art methods and baselines are provided in table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.1 Analysis of Network Parameters ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Differential Attention for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The baseline we use <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is the method used by us for obtaining exemplars. This uses a question embedding using an LSTM and an image embedding using a CNN. We additionally consider a variant of the same that uses attention. We have also obtained results for the stacked attention network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. The results for the Hierarchical Co-Attention work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> are obtained from the results reported in Das <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. We observe that in terms of rank correlation with human attention we obtain an improvement of around 10.7% using DAN network (with 4 nearest neighbors) and using DCN network (4 neighbors with multiplication module and learned scaling weights) we obtain an improvement of around 11% over the comparable baseline. We also obtain an improvement of around 6% over the Hierarchical Co-Attention work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> that uses co-attention on both image and questions. Further incorporating MCB improves the results for both DAN and DCN resulting in an improvement of 7.4% over Hierarchical co-attention work and 5.9% improvement over MCB method. However, as noted by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, using a saliency based method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> that is trained on eye tracking data to obtain a measure of where people look in a task independent manner results in more correlation with human attention (0.49). However, this is explicitly trained using human attention and is not task dependent. In our approach, we aim to obtain a method that can simulate human cognitive abilities for solving tasks.</p>

There have been a number of methods proposed for this benchmark dataset for evaluating the VQA task. Among the notable different methods, the Hierarchical Co-Attention work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> obtains 61.8% accuracy on VQA task, the dynamic parameter prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> method obtains 57.2% and the stacked attention network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> obtains 58.7% accuracy. We observe that the differential context network performs well outperforming all the image based attention methods and results in an accuracy of 60.9%. This is a strong result and we observe that the performance improves across different kinds of questions. Further, on combining the method with MCB, we obtain improved results of 65% and 65.4% using DAN and DCN respectively improving over the results of MCB by 1.2%.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Discussion</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we further discuss different aspects of our method that are useful for understanding the method in more detail</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We first consider how exemplars improve attention. In differential attention network, we use the exemplars and train them using a triplet network. It is known that using a triplet (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and earlier by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>), that we can learn a representation that accentuates how the image is closer to the supporting exemplar as against the opposing exemplar. The attention is obtained between the image and language representations. Therefore the improved image representation helps in obtaining an improved attention vector. In DCN the same approach is used with the change that the differential exemplar feature is also included in the image representation using projections. More analysis in terms of understanding how the methods qualitatively improves attention is included in the project website.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We next consider whether improved attention implies improved performance. In our empirical analysis we observed that we obtain improved attention <span id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">and</span> improved accuracies in VQA task. While there could be other ways of improving performance on VQA (as suggested by MCB<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> ) these can be additionally incorporated with the proposed method and these do yield improved performance in VQA</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly we consider whether image (I) and question embedding (Q) are both relevant. We had considered this issue and had conducted experiments by considering I only, by considering Q only, and by considering nearest neighbor using the semantic feature of both Q&amp;I. We had observed that the Q&amp;I embedding from the baseline VQA model performed better than other two. Therefore we believe that both contribute to the embedding.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6 </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we propose two different variants for obtaining differential attention for solving the problem of visual question answering. These are differential attention network (DAN) and differential context network (DCN). Both the variants provide significant improvement over the baselines. The method provides an initial view of improving VQA using an exemplar based approach. In future, we would like to further explore this model and extend it to joint image and question based attention models.

Table- <a href="#A1.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ A.3 Training and Model Configuration ‣ Appendix A Experimental Setup ‣ Differential Attention for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> provides the statistics of rank correlation on HAT validation dataset for various differential attention networks(DAN) and differential context network(DCN). DAN network is varied by varying the number of nearest supporting and opposing exemplars. We did experiments by considering K=1,2, 3,4,5 and random selections of nearest and farthest neighbors.</p>

<div id="A2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This table also mentions rank correlation for two types of DCN, i.e DCN Add and DCN Mul. Each type of network has two different methods for training , one is fixed scaling weights,i.e DCN Mul and second one is learn-able scaling weights,i.e, DCN Mul_v1. From the statistics of rank correlation in this table indicates that learnable scaling weights performs better than fixed weights. Further, we observed that Multiplication network performs better than addition network in case of differential context. We did experiments for K=1,2,3,4, but this table only shows the results of K=1 and K=4 for number of nearest and farthest neighbors selections.</p>

This table contains 3 rank correlations for 3 attention maps per image on HAT validation dataset. First attention map gives better accuracy than other two. Finally we take an average of three rank correlation for a particular model. We can observe that, all our model attention maps correlate positively with human attention.</p>

That is first cluster mean distance is minimum cluster distance from target and 20th cluster mean distance is the maximum cluster distance from the target.</p>
