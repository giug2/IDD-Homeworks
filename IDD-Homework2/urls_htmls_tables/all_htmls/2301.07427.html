<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data generation has been widely adopted in software testing, data privacy, imbalanced learning, artificial intelligence explanation, etc.
In all such contexts, it is important to generate plausible data samples.
A common assumption of approaches widely used for data generation is the independence of the features.
However, typically, the variables of a dataset depend on one another, and these dependencies are not considered in data generation leading to the creation of implausible records.
The main problem is that dependencies among variables are typically unknown.
In this paper, we design a synthetic dataset generator for tabular data that is able to discover nonlinear causalities among the variables and use them at generation time.
State-of-the-art methods for nonlinear causal discovery are typically inefficient.
We boost them by restricting the causal discovery among the features appearing in the frequent patterns efficiently retrieved by a pattern mining algorithm.
To validate our proposal, we design a framework for generating synthetic datasets with known causalities.
Wide experimentation on many synthetic datasets and real datasets with known causalities shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In many real-world applications, it is fundamental to rely on synthetic data, especially when real data can be difficult to obtain due to privacy issues, temporal or budget constraints, or the unavailability of large quantities.
Synthetic data are used for validating data discovery applications and for testing software in a controlled environment that satisfies specific conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
In machine learning, synthetic data are increasingly being used for addressing imbalanced learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, for training a model with the intention of transfer learning to real data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, or, in the last days, for providing explanations of obscure decision systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Indeed, various studies show the benefits of using synthetic data located in the neighborhood of available real instances for learning predictive models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, or for explaining the reasons for the prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In these scenarios, the methods used for synthetic data generation are either simple but efficient random approaches assuming uniform distribution for all the variables <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, or complex and time expensive methods such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
However, typically, only a few of them rely on explicit knowledge about possible linear and/or nonlinear dependencies among the variables.
In particular, common generative approaches work on the assumption that the variables of the dataset to generate are independent.
Such an assumption does not guarantee a reliable synthetic generation of the dataset under analysis.
On the other hand, GAN-like approaches can theoretically learn possible dependencies, but these are not explicitly represented, and there is no guarantee that they are followed in the data generation process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, a crucial problem in synthetic data generation is that dependencies among variables are not used because they are typically unknown.
Our idea is to design a technique for synthetic data generation that accounts for dependencies among variables by exploiting a <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">causal discovery</span> algorithm.
Causal discovery algorithms take as input a set of variables belonging to a dataset and determine which are the causal relationships among them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
In particular, we focus on <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">nonlinear causal discovery</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
If the dataset under analysis is continuous-valued, methods based on linear causal models are commonly applied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
This typically happens because linear models are well understood and not necessarily because the true causal relationships are believed to be linear <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
However, in reality, many causal relationships are nonlinear, raising doubts on the reliability and usability of linear methods.
In addition, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> it is shown that considering nonlinear causal relationships plays a primary role in the identification of causal directions.
For these reasons, we start from the <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">n</span>onlinear <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">c</span>ausal <span id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">d</span>iscovery method described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> (<span id="S1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span>) to design our synthetic data generator exploiting causal relationships.
Besides non-linearity, the <span id="S1.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> is able to consider and discover not only binary relationships but also multivariate ones.
Unfortunately, the <span id="S1.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> approach is inefficient and can only be employed to reveal the causal relationships of datasets with a very small number of variables.
Thus, it is not practically usable for applications on real datasets.
Our proposal is to boost <span id="S1.p3.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> by restricting the search of causalities among the features appearing in the patterns returned by a pattern mining algorithm executed on the same dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our contribution is twofold.
First, we design an efficient method for nonlinear causal discovery based on pattern mining named <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> (<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">n</span>onlinear <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">c</span>ausal <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">d</span>iscovery with <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">A</span>priori).
Second, we implement <span id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span>, a <span id="S1.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ge</span>nerative method based on <span id="S1.p4.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span>.
Moreover, to validate our proposal, we realized a framework for generating synthetic datasets with known causalities.
We report wide experimentation on synthetic datasets and real datasets with known causalities highlighting the effectiveness of our proposals both in terms of time and accuracy for causal discovery and data generation.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we review existing proposals in the literature related to causal discovery and synthetic data generation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The discovery of causal relationships between a set of observed variables is a fundamental problem in science because it enables predictions of the consequences of actions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Thus, the development of automatic and data-driven causal discovery methods constitutes an important research topic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
A standard approach for causal discovery is to estimate a Markov equivalence class of directed acyclic graphs from the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
The independence tests often adopt linear models with Gaussian noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
However, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> shows that non-Gaussian noise in linear models can actually help in distinguishing the causal directions.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> is shown that nonlinear models can play a role similar to that of non-Gaussianity.
Indeed, when causal relationships are nonlinear it allows the identification of causal directions by breaking the symmetry between the variables.
Also, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> shows that non-invertible functional relationships between the variables can provide clues to identify causal relationships.
For nonlinear models with additive noise almost any nonlinear relationship (invertible or not) typically suggests identifiable models.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is presented a nonlinear causal discovery approach for high dimensional data based on the idea of mapping the observations to high dimensional space with a kernel such that the nonlinear relations become simple linear ones.
A problem of the aforementioned nonlinear causal discovery approaches is that they can miss detecting indirect causal relationships, which are frequently encountered in practice and result from omitted intermediate causal variables.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> is proposed a cascade nonlinear additive noise model to represent such causal influences in a way that each direct causal relation follows the nonlinear additive noise model only observing initial cause and final effect.
Despite various advantages of the recent proposals, to the best of our knowledge, the nonlinear causal discovery described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is the only one that allows managing not only binary relationships.
For this reason, we adopt it as starting point of our procedure.
However, we highlight that our proposal is a framework that can exploit the preferred causal discovery method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The need to generate synthetic data derives from the first data imputation work to solve the problem of non-responses in statistical surveys <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is described one of the first multiple imputation techniques used to synthetically generate the values of a set of missing attributes for the records of the dataset.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> are implemented and extend multiple imputation approaches for the specific case of synthetic data generation.
In machine learning, synthetic data are often used for handling the classification task in case of imbalanced data and for addressing the problem of outcome explanation of black-box classifiers.
Concerning imbalanced learning, the <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">smote</span> algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> generates an arbitrary number of synthetic instances to shift the learning bias toward the minority class.
The <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">adasyn</span> approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> is based on the idea of adaptively generating minority data samples according to their distributions.
In practice, the method generates more synthetic samples for minority classes that are harder to learn compared to those minority samples that are easier to learn.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> is introduced an alternative method to synthesize data through a non-parametric technique that uses classification and regression trees.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> is proposed <span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DataSynthesizer</span>, a technique that captures the underlying correlation structure between different attributes by building a Bayesian network.
Another recent generator is the <span id="S2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Synthetic Data Vault</span> (<span id="S2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">sdv</span>) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> which uses the multivariate Gaussian copula (<span id="S2.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gcm</span>) to calculate the covariances between the input columns.
After that, the distributions and covariances are sampled to return synthetic data.
In addition, recently, many generative models have been developed based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their extensions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and autoencoders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Their success is due to their high effectiveness and flexibility in generating and representing data.
These approaches are particularly employed for the generation of synthetic images and, in general, for unstructured data such as text or time series.
However, recently, they are being effectively applied also for the generation of tabular data.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> are proposed synthetic tabular data generators using GANs, Conditional GANs and Variational Autoencoders (VAE).
Unfortunately, since they are based on deep learning procedures, they require a non-negligible amount of data and a considerable amount of time.
Finally, in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, data generation approaches are used to learn interpretable models able to mimic black-box decision systems.
<span id="S2.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">lime</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> explains the local behavior of a black-box classifier by learning a linear model on synthetic data generated around the instance to explain using a <span id="S2.p3.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">normal</span> distribution.
<span id="S2.p3.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">lore</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> is another local explanation method that exploits a synthetic neighborhood generation based on a genetic algorithm to create a more compact dataset around the explained instance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Among wide literature concerning synthetic data generation and causality, integrated approaches are a recently challenging research area. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, authors
implement <span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CauseMe</span>, a platform to benchmark causal discovery methods acting on time series.
In 2021, Lawrence et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> propose an easily parameterizable process that provides the capability to generate synthetic time series from vastly different scenarios.
Lastly, Wood-Doughty et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> present a synthetic text generator to evaluate causal inference (not causal discovery) methods.
Thus, to the best of my knowledge, no state-of-the-art synthetic data generators explicitly allow for encoding causal relationships.</p>

Apriori proposes an effective way to eliminate candidate itemsets without counting their support.
It is based on the principle that if an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.
This principle is used for pruning candidates during the itemset generation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Nonlinear Causal Discovery ‣ III Setting the Stage ‣ Boosting Synthetic Data Generation with Effective Nonlinear Causal Discovery" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a> we have described the method of causal discovery based on nonlinear models with additional noise (<span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span>).
We have shown that: <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(i)</span> the procedure allows for unambiguous identification of the causal relationships, and that <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(ii)</span> unlike other causal discovery methods, <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> is also applicable to multivariate data.
Despite these advantages, the main problem with <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> is the need to explore all the possible direct acyclic graphs (DAGs) to identify the final causal structure <math id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tilde{G}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mover accent="true" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">G</mi><mo id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">~</mo></mover><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">~</ci><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐺</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\tilde{G}</annotation></semantics></math>.
It follows that the computational complexity of the algorithm is super-exponential <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
Hence, we propose a solution to this bottleneck by exploiting the Apriori algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our idea can be summarized as follows.
First, we apply Apriori to the dataset under study for extracting the frequent patterns.
Then, we test the causal relationships considering only the combination of variables appearing together in any of the itemset extracted with Apriori.
In other words, we use Apriori as a filter to reduce the number of possible combinations and to reduce the search space for <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span>.
It follows that the <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> approach is no longer applied on all the possible combinations of variables in the dataset, but only on those for which there are <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text">frequent patterns that highlight a correlation.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our intuition comes from the fact that, thanks to the extraction of frequent itemsets, Apriori provides useful information on the correlations among the variables.
The fact that variables are correlated does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship.
Indeed, while <span id="S4.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">causation</span> and <span id="S4.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">correlation</span> can exist at the same time, correlation does not necessarily imply causation.
Correlation means there is a relationship or pattern among certain variables, while causation means that one (set of) variable(s) causes another one to occur.
However, there is a need for some “link” between the variables involved for causality to exist.
In other terms, we exploit the presence of variables in a pattern and their observed correlation as a “clue” about the possible presence of a causal relationship.
This assumption is the core of our intuition, and it suggested introducing an intermediate filtering step in the discovery of the causal structure by exploiting pattern mining.</p>

First, we illustrate the evaluation measures adopted.
Then, we detail the framework developed for generating synthetic datasets with known causalities, and we describe the real datasets.
After that, we show the baselines used to compare with our proposal.
Finally, we report the experimental settings, the empirical evaluation, and the sensitivity analysis.</p>

If the LOF is lower than one, it means that a higher density surrounds a point than its neighbors, and it is considered an inlier, i.e., an acceptable synthetic record in our setting.
On the other hand, the point is considered an outlier.</p>

This aspect is fundamental in the context of causal discovery.
Indeed, to evaluate these methodologies, we need to rely on the structure of the DAG to test the identified causal relationships.
However, since the literature lacks this type of information, we developed a generator of random synthetic continuous datasets for which the causal structure is known a priori.</p>

Following the topological ordering of the DAG, we ensure the independent variables are generated before the dependent ones.
Second, the features matching dependent variables are generated by combining the parent variables with randomly selected binary functions and by applying to each parent variable a randomly selected nonlinear function among sine, cosine, square root, logarithm, and tangent.
Finally, like for independent variables, the generator adds a uniform noise in <math id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="[-1,1]" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.2.cmml">[</mo><mrow id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1.cmml"><mo id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1a" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn></mrow><mo id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.2.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.1.1.cmml">1</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.4" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.2.cmml">]</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2b"><interval closure="closed" id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1"><apply id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1"><minus id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2.2.1.1.2">1</cn></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.1.1">1</cn></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.11.m11.2c">[-1,1]</annotation></semantics></math> also to dependent variables.</p>

Indeed, our intuition is that correlation among variables is a clue for causation.
Therefore, simple coefficients like Pearson (<span id="S5.SS3.p2.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">pc</span>), Spearman (<span id="S5.SS3.p2.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">sc</span>) and Hoeffding’s D (<span id="S5.SS3.p2.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">hc</span>) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> could be used in replacement of Apriori.

A higher number of distributions (each one with its parameters) increases the computation time but also improves the performance as more accurate independent variables can be described.
For the ensemble regressor in <span id="S5.SS4.p1.9.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> we rely on the GPR, SVM, kNN, and DTR of <span id="S5.SS4.p1.9.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">scikit-learn</span> trained with default parameters.</p>

<div id="S5.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The first aspect that we analyze is the impact of <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">apriori</span> on the performance of <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> for the task of causal discovery.
In Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V-B Synthetic and Real Datasets ‣ V Experiments ‣ Boosting Synthetic Data Generation with Effective Nonlinear Causal Discovery" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> we observe the performance of <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> and <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> in terms of runtime and F1-measure for DAGs with a growing number of features.
With <sup id="S5.SS5.p1.1.5" class="ltx_sup">∗</sup> we indicate that for <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> the average value considers only the cases in which the procedure terminated within an hour.
Given a <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">number of features</span>, we randomly generated 50 DAGs and datasets with the approach of Sec. <a href="#S5.SS2" title="V-B Synthetic and Real Datasets ‣ V Experiments ‣ Boosting Synthetic Data Generation with Effective Nonlinear Causal Discovery" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span></span></a>.
We notice how <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> has a remarkable improvement in terms of runtime that becomes evident when <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">number of features</span> is higher than 4.
Thus, the computational time required by <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> is exponentially lower than the one required by <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span>.
The third column shows the negligible impact of <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">apriori</span> on the runtime of <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span>.
Besides, from the F1-measure, we notice that <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">apriori</span> does not impact the performance of <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.15" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> to <span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.16" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> when observing the correctness of the causal relationships discovered in terms of F1-measure.

We remark that for each DAG, we generate ten different datasets.
In Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ V-D Experimental Settings ‣ V Experiments ‣ Boosting Synthetic Data Generation with Effective Nonlinear Causal Discovery" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> we report the average performance among the ten datasets.
We immediately notice that <span id="S5.SS5.p2.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> has the overall better accuracy.
However, accuracy cannot be very informative due to the high number of true negative related to the sparseness of the DAGs.
Concerning precision is the best performer on all the DAGs.
This aspect is crucial as the causalities identified result to be correct nearly always.
Finally, recall <span id="S5.SS5.p2.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> is more conservative as it sometimes fails to recognize some causal relationships to correlation indexes.
However, the average recall remains higher than the competitors.</p>

Analyzing the results we notice that for the bivariate datasets <span id="S5.SS5.p4.4.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">abalone</span>, <span id="S5.SS5.p4.4.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">oldf</span>, <span id="S5.SS5.p4.4.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">dwd</span> and <span id="S5.SS5.p4.4.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">undata</span>, all the approaches manage to identify the causal direction.
However, these good results do not indicate that it is possible to identify causalities by exploiting correlations since this only happens when there is only a single causal dependence.

We notice that, as expected, <span id="S5.SS5.p5.5.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">rnd</span> is the fastest approach while <span id="S5.SS5.p5.5.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">tvae</span> and <span id="S5.SS5.p5.5.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ctgan</span> are the slowest.
<span id="S5.SS5.p5.5.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> is the second-fastest performer, which is a valuable property considering the good qualitative results discussed in the following.</p>

We notice that <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> is the best performer in terms of RMSE for synthetic datasets and the second-best performer in terms of SSE.
Indeed, <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">tvae</span> has very good results followed by <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ctgan</span> and finally by <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">rnd</span>.
Therefore, it seems that the neural networks modeling the VAE learned by <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">tvae</span> are somewhat able to capture also the causalities learned by <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> through the <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> procedure.
However, concerning <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">tvae</span>, <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> shows a smaller running time and therefore higher usability on a larger dataset.
This is due to the fact that <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> learns relationships among variables exploiting patterns and does not need to consider many instances as required by VAEs in <span id="S5.SS5.p6.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">tvae</span>.

We immediately notice that <span id="S5.SS5.p7.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> is the only method without asterisks indicating that the majority of the population generated has a low LOF: the synthetic records of <span id="S5.SS5.p7.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> are fewer outliers than those generated with other methods.
Again, these results are underlined by the CD plots on the top right in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-E Results ‣ V Experiments ‣ Boosting Synthetic Data Generation with Effective Nonlinear Causal Discovery" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>: <span id="S5.SS5.p7.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> is the best performer followed by <span id="S5.SS5.p7.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">tvae</span> and they are statistically comparable.
However, empirically <span id="S5.SS5.p7.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> shows better results for synthetic datasets.
On the other hand, for real datasets, the performance is comparable among the various methods, but <span id="S5.SS5.p7.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> is still ranked first.
Concerning the number of outliers, results are comparable but, with the above parameter setting of LOF, <span id="S5.SS5.p7.2.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">tvae</span> generates a slightly lower number of outliers than <span id="S5.SS5.p7.2.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> for synthetic datasets, while the results are comparable for real ones.</p>

We notice that a higher number of bins improves the precision (and the accuracy), while a lower one only fosters the recall.
Since our final objective is to discover causal relationships for data generation, we prefer to be conservative and we consider the causal structure only when we are sure that we have a causal relationship.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have observed how <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncda</span> overcomes the limitation of <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> while maintaining comparable performance.
Besides, we have shown that <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> produces more realistic synthetic data than those generated with trivial baselines and it is comparable with time-consuming state-of-the-art generators.
Also, <span id="S6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> requires fewer instances than GANs or VAEs and also works on high dimensionality settings.
From an applications viewpoint, the exploitation of <span id="S6.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> that provides insights of causal mechanisms will allow circumventing plausibility concerns creating trustful scenarios for developing ML algorithms in critical domains such as healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several future research directions are possible.
First, we would like to stress <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> with larger datasets and DAGs with more variables.
Second, we have focused on continuous datasets, but it would be interesting to extend our proposal to datasets with categorical attributes.
Third, <span id="S6.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> is indeed a framework.
Thus, it could be interesting to evaluate how it behaves when replacing <span id="S6.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">ncd</span> with other approaches, and/or the ensemble of regressors with another regressor (for instance, a deep neural network) to check if it is possible to improve the performance.
Also, it could be interesting to test <span id="S6.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> on other data types.
Fourth, it would be nice to investigate if there are theoretical properties related to the filtering through Apriori when searching for causal relationships.
Finally, we would like to study the impact of <span id="S6.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">gencda</span> used as a generative procedure of explainability approaches such as <span id="S6.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">lime</span> or <span id="S6.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">lore</span>.</p>
