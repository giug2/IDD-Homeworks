<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and over-the-air federated learning (AirFL) into a unified framework using one simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS).
The STAR-RIS plays an important role in adjusting the decoding order of hybrid users for efficient interference mitigation and omni-directional coverage extension.
To capture the impact of non-ideal wireless channels on AirFL, a closed-form expression for the optimality gap (a.k.a. convergence upper bound) between the actual loss and the optimal loss is derived.
This analysis reveals that the learning performance is significantly affected by the active and passive beamforming schemes as well as wireless noise.
Furthermore, when the learning rate diminishes as the training proceeds, the optimality gap is explicitly shown to converge with linear rate.
To accelerate convergence while satisfying quality-of-service requirements, a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated by jointly designing the transmit power at users and the configuration mode of STAR-RIS.
Next, a trust region-based successive convex approximation method and a penalty-based semidefinite relaxation approach are proposed to handle the decoupled non-convex subproblems iteratively.
An alternating optimization algorithm is then developed to find a suboptimal solution for the original MINLP problem.
Extensive simulation results show that
i) the proposed framework can efficiently support NOMA and AirFL users via concurrent uplink communications,
ii) our algorithms achieve faster convergence rate on IID and non-IID settings compared to existing baselines,
and iii) both the spectrum efficiency and learning performance is significantly improved with the aid of the well-tuned STAR-RIS.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Beyond transmitting bits, the next-generation wireless networks are expected to support diverse services (from sensing and communication to edge intelligence) in different application scenarios, such as smart cities, metaverse, intelligent manufacturing, and autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In order to support ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive intelligence at the network edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, future sixth generation (6G) wireless networks require a new multiple access paradigm to provide guaranteed communication quality and learning performance for stable and customized services by effectively coordinating limited wireless resources in distributed facilities.
One major challenge is that of supporting data-intensive applications and privacy-sensitive services with non-ideal noisy links and limited communication resources, so that the diverse requirements of future intelligent 6G networks can be satisfied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an exponential growth in the number of terminals (e.g., sensors, cameras, and smart phones), some of which are sensing-oriented monitoring devices while others are likely to be computing-oriented learning devices.
For the former, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can be used to improve spectral efficiency by serving multiple devices over the same time-frequency resource <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Such a spectrum sharing scheme has attracted significant interest due to its ability to break orthogonality and meet stringent networking requirements of future 6G networks, especially for massive connectivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and low latency communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
For the latter, a promising distributed machine learning method, called federated learning (FL), has be conceived to making full use of decentralized data while protecting user privacy.
Although FL can effectively exploit the substantial computational resources of geo-distributed smart devices, the communication bottleneck problem has attracted a lot of attention due to the ever-increasing high-dimensional model parameters of deep neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Compared with most existing FL proposals based on conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, over-the-air FL (AirFL) allows all users to aggregate a shared model by utilizing the superposition property of the uplink wireless channel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
Different from the interference-combating OMA schemes, AirFL is a customized scheme that enjoys the improved throughput and reduced latency by harnessing the interference of multiple access channels.
Despite recent growing efforts on joint design of sensing- and computing-oriented applications, there are still many open issues yet to be addressed in this entirely new area exploring the interplay between communication and learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In particular, network architectures fulfilling 6G’s vision of agile sensing and ubiquitous intelligence remain largely undefined, which motivates the exploration of practical techniques that can efficiently integrate wireless communication and distributed learning into a unified framework.
For example, an potential solution is to combine the state-of-the-art networking and learning technologies (e.g., NOMA and AirFL) for satisfying the diverse demands in 6G networks.
However, this combination may make the design, optimization, and analysis of such an integrated network totally distinct from that of conventional networks consisting of only NOMA or AirFL users.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Distinctly different from conventional wireless networks where the environment is uncontrollable, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS, a.k.a., intelligent reflecting surface) suggest a new communication paradigm that can tune the phase shifts of incident signals flexibly to create favorable propagation conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
However, due to its limited physical implementation, a key issue is that both transmitters and receivers have to be at the same side of the RIS, which inherently results in incomplete wireless coverage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
In contrast to existing reflecting-only RIS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR) RIS was recently developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to realize a full-space smart radio environment, where the source and the destination can be located in either side of the STAR-RIS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
By reaping its benefits, introducing STAR-RIS into existing wireless networks is beneficial to adjust the multiple access channel on demand.
Furthermore, compared to traditional AirFL schemes that only optimize the transceiver, the STAR-RIS introduces additional control dimensions to better match the function computation requirements of AirFL, which can combat the aggregation error caused by signal distortion and further improve the learning performance of AirFL.
In order to support heterogeneous services (e.g., ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive intelligence) and guarantee their respective performance, we suggest to integrate STAR-RIS into the considered network for flexible signal processing and enhanced coverage.
However, the introduction of STAR-RIS increases the complexity of channel estimation and resource optimization due to the newly established reflective/transmissive links.
Besides, such an integration also raises more stringent signal processing requirements for the receiver to decode individual information and aggregate model updates in an efficient manner.</p>

Toward this end, the following critical issues and potential challenges in an integrated network should be addressed:</p>

Simultaneously supporting communication and computation/learning services at the network edge suffer from shortage in the available resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
Dedicated bandwidth allocation will inevitably decrease the spectrum and energy efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, so that properly sharing spectrum resource among users is essential.
Furthermore, the battery capacity is usually insufficient for these low-cost end devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, it is important to perform power control at energy-constrained users for long-term utility maximization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Finally, wireless channels may be blocked by unfavorable propagation conditions and thus the effective coverage area of the base station (BS) is limited. Though the channel gains can be enhanced by the carefully designed STAR-RIS, the number of reflecting/transmitting elements is finite, namely its ability to adjust the wireless environment is limited as well, in particular when the phase shifts and amplitudes are selected from a finite number of discrete values in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

Although both NOMA users and AirFL users can be supported simultaneously by sharing spectrum skillfully and orchestrating resource elaborately, the co-channel interference between communication signals and learning signals has totally different effects on the performance of these heterogeneous users with different transmission goals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
Concretely, for communication-centric NOMA users, the individual signal is expected to be separated from the received superposition signal.
Thus, co-channel interference is an obstacle to guarantee QoS requirements for communication signals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
In contrast, for learning-centric AirFL users, the co-channel interference can be well exploited to complete the gradient/model aggregation via concurrent uplink communications, which is proved to be beneficial for bandwidth saving and latency reduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
However, most prior works only consider the interference from single-type users, which results in existing solutions not being applicable to integrated networks of communication and learning.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper advocates a unified framework serving NOMA and AirFL users simultaneously via STAR-RIS aided concurrent communications, which aims to overcome the scarcity of system bandwidth and to support various on-demand applications.
We address the problem of interference mitigation by developing a successive interference cancellation (SIC) based signal processing scheme with the aid of the STAR-RIS.
It is worth pointing out that the STAR-RIS in this framework plays an indispensable role to coordinate the decoding order between two types of users and is also an essential component to extend the efficient coverage area of wireless networks as compared to conventional reflecting-only RIS.
Accordingly, theoretical analysis is performed to confirm the convergence guarantee of our framework.
Then, subject to the power budget, binary mode switching and unit modulus constraints, performance optimization is applied to achieve a faster convergence speed while satisfying the QoS requirements with limited resources.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to provide a compatible uplink framework by integrating NOMA and AirFL seamlessly with the aid of the STAR-RIS.
The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:</p>

We design a STAR-RIS assisted heterogeneous fusion framework by supporting communication-centric NOMA users and learning-centric AirFL users in a non-orthogonal manner.
Since the complete temporal and spectral resources are utilized by all users simultaneously, an efficient co-channel interference cancellation technique is exploited to guarantee the quality of the communication signal while harnessing the superposition property of multiple-access channels for the computation signal.
The key advantage of the developed signal processing scheme is that it can skillfully separate the individual signal of NOMA users while preserving the aggregated signal of AirFL users, which provides the best of both worlds.</p>

We prove that, using a diminishing learning rate, the optimality gap is guaranteed to converge linearly with a rate of <math id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{O}\left(1/t\right)" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">𝒪</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mi id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></mrow><mo id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"></times><ci id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝒪</ci><apply id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><divide id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1"></divide><cn type="integer" id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2">1</cn><ci id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.I2.i2.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{O}\left(1/t\right)</annotation></semantics></math>, where <math id="S1.I2.i2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.I2.i2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.I2.i2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.I2.i2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.I2.i2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.I2.i2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.I2.i2.p1.2.m2.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> is the index of communication rounds.
Based on the theoretical analysis results, we formulate a resource allocation problem in the heterogeneous fusion network to improve the learning performance of AirFL users while satisfying the QoS requirements of NOMA users.
The problem captures a joint design of active and passive beamforming over training rounds, which is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem.</p>

To tackle the resulting NP-hard problem, we first decompose it into two tractable subproblems, and then an alternating optimization technique is adopted to find a suboptimal solution.
Specifically, for the power allocation (active beamforming) problem, we develop a trust region-based successive convex approximation (SCA) method.
For the STAR-RIS configuration (passive beamforming) problem, we propose a penalty-based semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach to address the issues with rank-one constraints and binary variables.
Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and algorithm design by training linear regression models on a synthetic dataset as well as building image classification models on real datasets.
Compared to benchmarks, simulation results demonstrate that our solution yields better performance in terms of communication capacity and learning behavior, even if the data is not identically distributed.</p>

The full space of signal propagation is divided into two parts by the STAR-RIS, namely the reflection space (left half space) and the transmission space (right half space) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
The location of each user determines that its uplink signal is reflected or transmitted by the STAR-RIS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although the STAR-RIS can simultaneously provide concurrent communication for both the reflection signals and the transmission signals by allowing hybrid users share the same orthogonal (time-frequency) wireless resources, it also leads to severe co-channel interference, especially in the case of massive connectivity.
However, as mentioned before, the co-channel interference has different effects on the performance of the communication-centric NOMA users and the learning-centric AirFL users.
On the one hand, the co-channel interference is harmful to the NOMA users, whose individual signals should be decoded from the received superposed signal.
On the other hand, the co-channel interference is conducive to improving the aggregation performance of AirFL users by turning the wireless channel into a computer with the functionality of a weighted sum.
Hence, an efficient signal processing scheme is needed to coordinate the co-channel interference in heterogeneous fusion networks, which plays a pivotal role in enhancing the overall system performance in terms of communication throughput and learning behavior.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By taking advantage of the SIC technique at the BS side, the signals from strong users can be decoded one by one to remove the co-channel interference for weak users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
In the sequel, the residual interference composed of signals from weak users can be harnessed for function computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.
To actualize this design, we propose a successive signal processing (SSP) scheme taking full advantage of the superposition property of multiple access channels.
The block diagram of the proposed SSP scheme is shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-C Concurrent Uplink Communication ‣ II System Model ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, where there are two key stages at the BS.
The first stage is devised to mitigate interference for NOMA users.
The second stage exploits interference for AirFL users.
The premise of this scheme is that all NOMA users are anticipated to be strong users with larger channel gains and all AirFL users are expected to become weak users having smaller channel gains.
Fortunately, by virtue of its flexible configuration ability, the STAR-RIS is capable of creating a controllable signal propagation environment over the full space.
Therefore, the STAR-RIS is particularly well suited for tackling the challenging issue of dynamically adjusting the channel conditions of hybrid users throughout the network.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the design above, through leveraging the STAR-RIS to tune channel conditions of hybrid users, one main advantage of our SSP scheme is its capability of separating the individual signal of NOMA users while preserving the aggregated signal of AirFL users.
As such, both NOMA users and AirFL users can be simultaneously served via concurrent communications in our framework.
However, it can be observed from (<a href="#S2.E9" title="In II-D Successive Signal Processing ‣ II System Model ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>) that the achievable communication rate of NOMA users is interfered by the signal from AirFL users.
Furthermore, the aggregation error in (<a href="#S2.E12" title="In II-D Successive Signal Processing ‣ II System Model ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>) may lead to a notable drop of AirFL users’ prediction accuracy in the inference process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
In this context, despite the fact that different effects of interference can be exploited by our SSP scheme, a more elaborate resource management solution is desired to enhance the overall system performance.
Therefore, we jointly design the power scalar of hybrid users and the configuration mode of STAR-RIS to improve the communication-learning efficiency with MSE tolerance for fast model aggregation and with QoS requirements for reliable data transmission.
Toward this end, our next sections are to theoretically confirm the convergence of our framework and answer two fundamental questions:
i) how non-ideal wireless channels affect the convergence behavior of AirFL users,
and ii) how to accelerate convergence while satisfying minimum data rate demands of NOMA users.</p>

The first term on the right-hand-side of (<a href="#S3.Ex1" title="Lemma 1 (One-round convergence) ‣ III-B Convergence Analysis ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) characterizes the learning gap of the previous round.
The second term is negatively related to the squared norm of the global gradient.
The third term is determined by the bound on the norm of local gradients.
The last term comes from the noisy channel and includes learning-related parameters.
Note that the first and last items are independent of the transmit power (active beamforming) and STAR-RIS configuration (passive beamforming) so that they can be regarded as two constants.
The middle two terms depend on the active and passive beamforming schemes and thus need to be optimized.</p>

In general, no existing method is applicable for solving such a NP-hard problem optimally.
More specifically, due to the temporal coupling in the objective function (<a href="#S3.E26.1" title="In 26 ‣ III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">26a</span></a>), problem (<a href="#S3.E26" title="In III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">26</span></a>) is still difficult to solve even when we only consider the transmit power allocation or STAR-RIS configuration design.
Compared to the conventional case with reflecting-only RIS, more optimization variables are involved in (<a href="#S3.E26" title="In III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">26</span></a>) as the element mode can also be optimized and the reflection/transmission phase shifts will have a joint effect on the system performance.
Besides, the mode optimization results in integer variables, which is more challenging compared with the reflecting-only RIS.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although the decoupled subproblems are simpler than (<a href="#S3.E26" title="In III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">26</span></a>), it is still extremely difficult to derive globally optimal solutions in the considered framework.
For example, the transmit power scalars are coupled over communication rounds and users in subproblem (<a href="#S3.E27" title="In item 1 ‣ III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">27</span></a>), which makes it highly non-convex.
Additionally, solving the configuration design subproblem (<a href="#S3.E28" title="In item 2 ‣ III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">28</span></a>) may result in exponential complexity due to the combinatorial feature of binary mode switching.
To obtain low-complexity solutions for the original MINLP problem (<a href="#S3.E26" title="In III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">26</span></a>), the subproblems are transformed to convex ones, as described next.</p>

By using the problem decomposition method of Section <span id="S4.SS3.p5.2.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\@slowromancap</span>iii@, the optimization problem formulated for the MIMO setup can be decomposed into three subproblems: transmit beamforming, STAR-RIS configuration, and receiving beamforming.
For the transmit beamforming subproblem, the zero-forcing precoding and matrix lifting-based SDR technique can be adopted to solve it heuristically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.
For the STAR-RIS configuration subproblem, the proposed penalty-based method can be extended to solve it efficiently, due to the similar constraint structure as problem (<a href="#S3.E26" title="In III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">26</span></a>).
For the receiving beamforming subproblem, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers can be employed to balance system performance and design complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
To avoid redundancy, the details of solving the optimization problem for the MIMO setup are omitted here for brevity.</p>

To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms for the STAR-RIS assisted heterogeneous network, we use one synthetic dataset and two real datasets in our experiments.
To be specific, for the synthetic dataset, we examine the proposed algorithm with one simple regression task, where the optimality gap over the training process is adopted as the performance metric by training a linear regression model with MSE loss function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.
For the real datasets, AirFL users are required to execute classification tasks where they need to collaboratively train (machine learning) ML models for image classification on the MINST and CIFAR-10 datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.

Moreover, it can be seen that the curve of all schemes has a fast linear convergence rate when the communication round <math id="S5.SS2.p1.14.m14.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.14.m14.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.14.m14.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.14.m14.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.14.m14.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.14.m14.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.14.m14.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.14.m14.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> is small.

This is because the learning performance is suffered from the limited size of the local datasets as the training goes on.
Fig. <a href="#S5.F5.sf2" title="In Figure 5 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5b</span></a> demonstrates the optimality gap under different numbers of STAR-RIS elements during the training process.
From this figure, one can see that increasing the number of STAR-RIS elements is beneficial to achieve lower optimality gap though the gains are not so significant.
However, if the STAR-RIS is removed from the integrated system (i.e., <math id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M=0" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mo id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.cmml">0</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3">0</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.16.m16.1c">M=0</annotation></semantics></math>), the learning performance of AirFL users degrades significantly due to the strong interference from NOMA users.
This validates the importance of interference management of non-orthogonal transmissions, and also reveals that using STAR-RIS to maintain the decoding order (<a href="#S2.E8" title="In II-D Successive Signal Processing ‣ II System Model ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>) is an effective design.</p>

Specifically, when the obstacle is considered in the integrated network, the direct links between the BS and all users are assumed to be blocked.
Otherwise, the LoS link is available to all NOMA and AirFL users.
From this figure, we can observe two phenomena in terms of the convergence behavior and data transmission rate.
First, compared to the blocking case (i.e., AirFL with obstacle), lower optimality gap can be achieved by the unblocking case (i.e., AirFL without obstacle) at the early communication rounds if the LoS links between the BS and AirFL users are available.
However, as the number of communication rounds increases, the performance gap between the above two schemes is negligible.
Second, the achievable uplink rate of NOMA users would be compromised to some extent when the LoS links between the BS and AirFL users are blocked.
Furthermore, it can be notice that the negative effects of link blocking are not be eliminated as the number of RIS elements increases
On the whole, the blocking issue experienced by the considered network affects the communication rate of NOMA users more than the learning performance of AirFL users.</p>

Namely, the system throughput can be greatly improved when the STAR-RIS is deployed very close to the users.
Furthermore, it is verified that when the direct links from users to the BS are blocked by obstacles (this is equivalent to the direct links experiencing rich scattering fading with unfavorable propagation conditions), the performance gain brought about by the STAR-IRS is deteriorated since only the signal transmitted/reflected by the STAR-IRS can be received at the BS compared to the case without obstacles.
In Fig. <a href="#S5.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7b</span></a>, we compare the achievable rate versus the number of STAR-RIS elements.
By comparing the proposed algorithm with conventional RIS, we verify the performance gain of the mode switching design.
Comparing our algorithm with random STAR-RIS, one can verify the performance gain of the transmitting/reflecting phase shifts design.
It is clear that the uplink throughput for all schemes increases with the number of passive elements at the STAR-IRS, which reveals the effectiveness of deploying more elements at the STAR-IRS before the performance gain reaches a saturation point.
It is evident from Fig. <a href="#S5.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7b</span></a> that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other two benchmarks in term of spectrum efficiency, which validates the necessity for the element-wise optimization of mode switching and phase shifts at the STAR-RIS.</p>

For the latter setting, each AirFL user only has images labeled by part of digital numbers.
It is the unbalanced partition that guarantees the non-IID distribution of samples.
Regardless of whether it is an IID setting or a non-IID setting in Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, the noise-free FL scheme obtains the optimal learning performance after <math id="S5.SS2.p4.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p4.4.m4.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.p4.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p4.4.m4.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p4.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p4.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p4.4.m4.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p4.4.m4.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> communication rounds are completed, while the equal power allocation scheme performs worst with a remarkable gap.
Among all benchmark schemes in Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving the learning performance closest to the ideal noise-free FL scheme in terms of training loss and test accuracy.
This verifies again the effectiveness of joint optimization of the transmit power at the users and the configuration design at the STAR-RIS.
Moreover, we notice that if the phase shifts are not properly tuned (i.e., random STAR-RIS), conventional RIS achieves a better learning performance.
The result implies that when the number of reflecting and transmitting elements is limited, optimizing the phase shifts dominates the performance.
This observation is also applicable to the results in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.
Compared with the IID settings, one can see that the learning curves for all schemes in the non-IID settings become noisier and suffer from poorer convergence behavior due to the unbalanced data distribution.
Additionally, Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> illustrates the learning performance of training a ResNet on the CIFAR-10 dataset with the IID and non-IID settings.
Note that the overall trends of all curves in Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> are similar to that in Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
Thus, the discussions for Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-B Performance Evaluation ‣ V Simulation Settings and Results ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> are omitted here for brevity.
Further comprehensive evaluation with more common network topologies, more diverse data distributions, and more realistic user mobility remain as future work.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we advocated a STAR-RIS integrated NOMA and AirFL framework to overcome the spectrum scarcity and support heterogeneous services (e.g., communication- and learning-centric tasks).
Based on the SIC decoding technique, a new design of successive signal processing for concurrent uplink communication was developed to coordinate interference among hybrid users and thus enhance system performance.
Then, we provided a closed-form expression for the optimality gap to characterize the impact of unfavorable wireless communication on the convergence rate of AirFL.
Next, we investigated a non-convex resource allocation problem in the considered heterogeneous network by jointly optimizing the transmit power at users and the configuration design at the STAR-RIS to minimize the optimality gap while guaranteeing QoS requirements.
Due to the non-convex nature of this problem, we developed an alternating optimization algorithm by devising a trust region-based SCA approach and a penalty-based SDR method to solve the decoupled subproblems iteratively.
Finally, experiments using synthetic and real datasets were conducted both to corroborate our theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
Simulation results also verified that our algorithms achieve better performance in terms of learning behavior and communication capacity than alternative benchmarks.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This work is an initial step in forming a universal framework for fulfilling 6G’s vision of ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive intelligence.
A number of interesting key problems and several possible extensions in this active and ongoing area are worthy of further investigation.
We hereby conclude this paper by discussing a few promising research directions, and highlighting several open problems:</p>

For one thing, in the wireless network, there may exist eavesdroppers which attempt to obtain the raw data uploaded by NOMA users or the model parameters updated by AirFL users.
For another, some malicious NOMA users are likely to inject fake data, while some untrustable AirFL users may launch model inference attacks to obtain private information of other users.
Therefore, it is essential to enhance the privacy and security of the proposed framework by tackling the issues such as illegal eavesdroppers, bogus data injection, and model inference attacks.</p>

User mobility brings challenging problems such as time-varying channels, dynamic node dropout/join, and inaccurate CSI.
As a result, one important future direction is to consider the impact of user mobility on the achievable performance of the proposed framework.
For example, it is critical but remain unsolved to develop a resilient solution that allows asynchronous model aggregation to adapt to the dynamic node dropout/join of high-mobility users.
In addition, some pending problems are to study the efficient channel acquisition method for the STAR-RIS-aided system and design robust joint active and passive beamforming schemes under time-varying channels and/or imperfect CSI, as well as analyze the impact of channel estimation error on the convergence rate of AirFL users and on the achievable throughput of NOMA users.</p>

Other valuable problems are to investigate the hybrid learning method at the BS by using the raw data and local updates transmitted by these local users, and to derive the theoretical analysis of practical scenarios such as non-convex loss functions and noisy data labels.
Also, extending the two-layer single-cell framework shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II System Model ‣ STAR-RIS Integrated Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Framework, Analysis, and Optimization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> to a multi-layer and/or multi-cell computing network is also of interest.
