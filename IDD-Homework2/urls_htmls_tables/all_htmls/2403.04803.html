<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">This paper introduces an advanced approach for fortifying Federated Learning (FL) systems against label-flipping attacks. We propose a simplified consensus-based verification process integrated with an adaptive thresholding mechanism. This dynamic thresholding is designed to adjust based on the evolving landscape of model updates, offering a refined layer of anomaly detection that aligns with the real-time needs of distributed learning environments. Our method necessitates a majority consensus among participating clients to validate updates, ensuring that only vetted and consensual modifications are applied to the global model. The efficacy of our approach is validated through experiments on two benchmark datasets in deep learning, CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Our results indicate a significant mitigation of label-flipping attacks, bolstering the FL system’s resilience. This method transcends conventional techniques that depend on anomaly detection or statistical validation by incorporating a verification layer reminiscent of blockchain’s participatory validation without the associated cryptographic overhead.
The innovation of our approach rests in striking an optimal balance between heightened security measures and the inherent limitations of FL systems, such as computational efficiency and data privacy. Implementing a consensus mechanism specifically tailored for FL environments paves the way for more secure, robust, and trustworthy distributed machine learning applications, where safeguarding data integrity and model robustness is critical.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a paradigm-shifting approach in machine learning, enabling models to be trained across multiple decentralized devices or servers while keeping the training data localized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This approach enhances privacy and leverages distributed data sources, making it highly applicable in various domains such as healthcare, finance, and telecommunications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the decentralized nature of FL introduces unique challenges, particularly regarding security. Among the most concerning threats are adversarial attacks, specifically label-flipping attacks, where adversaries maliciously alter the labels of data points in their training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. These attacks can significantly degrade the performance of the aggregated global model, posing a critical threat to the reliability of FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional defense mechanisms against such attacks in FL have predominantly focused on anomaly detection and robust aggregation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. While these methods are effective to an extent, they often fail to address more sophisticated or subtle forms of label manipulation. They can also lead to excluding legitimate, yet non-conforming, data updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel consensus-based label verification algorithm augmented by an adaptive thresholding mechanism in response to these challenges. Inspired by the validation mechanisms employed in blockchain technology, our approach requires consensus among multiple clients for a label to be considered accurate, with the added sophistication of dynamic threshold adjustment to respond to evolving attack patterns and data distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments using two well-established datasets in the field of deep learning: CIFAR and MNIST. The CIFAR dataset, with its complex image data, presents a challenging environment for testing the resilience of our algorithm against sophisticated attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In contrast, the MNIST dataset, known for its simpler structure, allows us to demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness in more controlled settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The novelty of our approach lies in its dual focus: enhancing security against adversarial attacks, specifically label-flipping, and maintaining the integrity of distributed data in FL systems. Our algorithm introduces a layer of consensus-based verification, akin to the blockchain, integrated with adaptive thresholding, a strategy not extensively explored in current FL research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

Assuming this discrepancy follows a known distribution, we estimate this distribution based on historical data of model updates under non-adversarial conditions. For practical estimation, we analyze the variance in discrepancies observed over multiple rounds of updates. This analysis allows us to model the distribution effectively, with Gaussian or Poisson distributions being common choices, depending on the data and learning task characteristics.</p>

<p id="S8.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The comparison demonstrates that our algorithm outshines Methods A and B in every evaluated metric. The superior accuracy rates on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 validate our algorithm’s adept learning capabilities in diverse environments. The heightened detection rates for adversarial activities affirm its strategic effectiveness in identifying and neutralizing potential threats. Most notably, the minimal false positive rate, especially the zero percent achieved on MNIST, illustrates our method’s precision in validating genuine data updates without inadvertently dismissing them as adversarial. Furthermore, the reduced false negative rates, relative to the other methods, underscore our algorithm’s finesse in discerning between genuine and adversarial updates, a testament to its meticulous design and implementation.</p>
