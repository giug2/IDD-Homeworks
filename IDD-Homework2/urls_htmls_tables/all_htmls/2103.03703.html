<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Globally, Skin carcinoma is among the most lethal diseases. Millions of people are diagnosed with this cancer every year. Sill, early detection can decrease the medication cost and mortality rate substantially. The recent improvement in automated cancer classification using deep learning methods has reached a human-level performance requiring a large amount of annotated data assembled in one location, yet, finding such conditions usually is not feasible. Recently, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train decentralized models in a privacy-preserved fashion depending on labeled data at the client-side, which is usually not available and costly. To address this, we propose <code id="id12.id1.1" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code>, a semi-supervised federated learning method. Our method is inspired by peer learning from educational psychology and ensemble averaging from committee machines. <code id="id12.id1.2" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> builds communities based on clients’ similarities. Then it encourages communities’ members to learn from each other to generate more accurate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. We also proposed the peer anonymization (PA) technique to <span id="id12.id1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">anonymize clients</span>. As a core component of our method, PA is orthogonal to other methods without additional complexity, and reduces the communication cost while enhances performance. Finally, we propose a dynamic peer learning policy that controls the learning stream to avoid any degradation in the performance, especially for the individual clients. Our experimental setup consists of 71,000 skin lesion images collected from 5 publicly available datasets. We test our method in four different scenarios in <code id="id12.id1.4" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code>. With few annotated data, <code id="id12.id1.5" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> is on par with a state-of-the-art method in skin lesion classification in the standard setup while outperforming <code id="id12.id1.6" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFLs</code> and the baselines by 1.8% and 15.8%, respectively. Also, it generalizes better to an unseen client while being less sensitive to noisy ones.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In the recent estimation, an expectation of two hundred thousand fatal invasive and in-situ melanoma cases will be diagnosed in the USA in 2021 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Siegel, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Yearly, millions of people are diagnosed with skin carcinoma  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rogers et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>. Worldwide, skin cancer is considered one of the most expensive and fatal cancers.
While most non-melanoma skin cancer cases can be cured, the melanoma ones are curable when detected in the early stages. For example, the 5-year survival rate ranges from 99<math id="S1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> in the earliest stage to 27<math id="S1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.2.m2.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.2.m2.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> for the latest stage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Siegel, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Moreover, early detection of skin cancer can reduce the treatment expenses significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Esteva et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Therefore, several attempts have investigated the automated classification of skin lesions in dermoscopic images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Clark Jr et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">1989</a>; Binder et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>; Schindewolf et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">1993</a>)</cite>. Though, these attempts require handcrafted engineered features and exhausted pre-processing steps.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Yet, huge improvements in computerized methods have been achieved in recent years. For instance, the deep-learning-based methods proved to have a superior <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gessert et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Lopez et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> or a human-level performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Esteva et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Tschandl et al., <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> when dealing with skin cancer classification.
Nevertheless, this success comes at the cost of exhausting pre-processing steps, a prudently designed framework, or a substantial amount of labeled data assembled in one location. In real life, medical data is generated from different scanners and unevenly distributed in multiple centers in raw formats without annotations resulting in heterogeneous data, or so-called Non-IIDness. Unfortunately, building a large repository of annotated medical data is quite challenging due to privacy burdens <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rieke et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Kaissis et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and labeling cost which is time-consuming and requires domain expert knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> has been recently proposed to learn machine learning models utilizing the ample amounts of labeled data distributed in mobile devices while maintaining clients’ privacy <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> without sharing the data.
The training process of federated learning starts at the server by broadcasting initial weights of global model parameters to a random set of participating clients, who share the same model architecture with the global model. Each client, afterward, trains locally on its local data before sending back the updated model parameters to the server. Once all clients send their updates, the server aggregates them using <code id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</code> to update the global model weights. Next, the updated global model is broadcasted to a new random set of clients before a new round of local training processes starts. Eventually, the previous steps are repeated until the global model converged. During the training, only model weights are shared while data is kept locally. Note that, the key properties of the FL are data privacy, Non-IIDness, and communication efficiency. Thus, FL goes in line with the nature of the medical setting.
Consequently, federated learning has been investigated by several works in the medical domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>; Albarqouni et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> paving the way to training machine learning models in privacy-preserved fashion in real-world applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Flores et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Roth et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Sarma et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Though, in the previous works, the training demand highly accurate labeled data, e.g., ground-truth confirmed through histopathology, which often is costly and not available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In a more realistic scenario, the clients may have access to a large amount of unlabeled data along with few annotated ones. Yet, willing to train a reliable model to make use of their data. Fortunately, the above scenario can be addressed by the semi-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm, which is the focus of this paper. In this regard, a very recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> has shown the applicability of semi-supervised learning in a federated setting (a.k.a. <code id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code>) for COVID-19 pathology segmentation. The previous work among the firsts who introduced semi-supervised learning to federated learning. Yet, they have straightforwardly applied a semi-supervised learning method, <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em> <code id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FixMatch</code> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sohn et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> locally. At first, a local model is trained in a fully supervised fashion using the labeled data. Then, the trained model is used to produce predictions for unlabeled data, where the predictions with high confidence are used to generate pseudo labels. Next, the pseudo labels are attached to the labeled data before a new training process starts. At the server, on the other hand, <code id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</code> was employed to organize the training between different clients, see Sec. <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>. Another recent work, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposed an <code id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> approach; <code id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedIRM</code> for skin lesion classification. They suggested distilling the knowledge from labeled clients to unlabeled ones through building a disease relation matrix, extracted from the labeled clients, and providing it to the unlabeled ones to guide the pseudo-labeling process. In a more challenging situation, which has not been yet investigated thoroughly in the medical images, the labeled data is located at the server side while the clients have access only to unlabeled data. This scenario has been addressed in this paper, see Sec. <a href="#S3.SS7" title="3.7 Unlabeled Clients Scenario ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.7</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In <code id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code>, clients are only trained i) globally, where the knowledge is accumulated in global model parameters, and ii) locally, where the knowledge is distilled via the local data. While this is a simple and straightforward approach, we argue that the knowledge gain for generating pseudo labels for the local models is limited. Instead, we hypothesize that gaining extra knowledge by learning from similar clients <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> Peer Learning (PL) is highly significant assuming that peer learning encourages the self-confidence of the clients by sharing their knowledge in a way that does not expose their identities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our method is highly inspired by the social science literature, where peer learning is defined as acquiring skills and knowledge through active helping among the companions. It involves people from similar social groups helping each other to learn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Topping, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>. Peer Learning includes peer tutoring, coaching, mentoring, and others. Though, the distinguishing between these types of PL is out of the scope of this paper. In this work, the link between peer learning and federated learning is direct, where the clients are considered as peers learning from each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In the computer science literature, a similar concept to peer learning has been introduced known as Committee Machines (CM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tresp, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>; Aubin et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Joksas et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. In a nutshell, CM is a well-known and active research direction and is defined as an ensemble of estimators, consisting of neural networks or committee members, that cooperate to obtain better accuracy than the individual networks. The committee prediction is generated by ensemble averaging (EA) of the individual members’ predictions. CM has shown to be effective in machine learning hardware <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Joksas et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, yet, it has not been investigated in FL.
In this work, we employ the ensemble averaging from the committee machine for our <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">peers anonymization</span> (PA) technique. PA improves privacy by hiding clients’ identities. Moreover, PA reduces the communication cost while preserving performance. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has proposed the PA technique in the <code id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> for the medical images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Peer learning has shown an increase in the performance for the majority of clients, see Sec. <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 The Influence of Peer Learning on Clients ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>. However, for some clients, peer learning and federated models could harm their performance. Thus, we propose a dynamic peer-learning policy that controls the learning process. Our dynamic learning policy maintains the performance of all clients while boosting the accuracy of the individual ones, see Sec. <a href="#S3.SS10" title="3.10 Dynamic Learning Policy ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.10</span></a>.</p>

In this work, we adopt the same concept and describe a group of clients as ”peers” if they are similar.
Previous work has shown that clustering can be achieved using models updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Briggs et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, While other works measure similarities between deep neural networks by comparing the representations between layers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kornblith et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.

This is a helpful process since a main property of the medical data is the data heterogeneity.
In federated learning, the clients experience different data and class distribution during the training. Thus, accumulating and sharing the distributed knowledge is useful. Particularly, it can help the local client generate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data from experiences that might never have learned from its own labeled data. To realize this, we modify the pseudo label defined in Eq.<a href="#S2.E3" title="In 2.2 Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> to include the predictions of the similar <math id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.m2.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> peers, <em id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> <math id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f_{t}(\cdot;\phi)" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2a"><mrow id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.cmml"><msub id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.2" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.2.cmml">f</mi><mi id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.3" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.2" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.2.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.1.cmml">(</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">⋅</mo><mo id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.2.2" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.1.cmml">;</mo><mi id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.2" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.2.cmml">ϕ</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.2.3" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2b"><apply id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3"><times id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.1"></times><apply id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.2">𝑓</ci><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.2.3">𝑡</ci></apply><list id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.3.3.2"><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.1.1">⋅</ci><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2.2">italic-ϕ</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.3.m3.2c">f_{t}(\cdot;\phi)</annotation></semantics></math> according to the similarity matrix <math id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{W}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">𝒲</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝒲</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.4.m4.1c">\mathcal{W}</annotation></semantics></math> as</p>

Eventually, the anonymized peer is shared only one time for each client at every training round, not at every local update. The advantages of the anonymized peer are i) it reduces the communication cost as sharing the knowledge of one peer is better than sharing 2 or more peers, ii) hides clients’ identities by creating an anonymized peer.
Finally, to prevent the local model from deviated from its local knowledge, we employ an MSE loss as a consistency-regularization term, which broadly used in semi-supervised learning,</p>

In peer learning, the clients are divided into groups or communities based on their similarities. A natural result of this step is also individual clients who do not belong to any community. Practically, we may have no control over the effect of applying the static peer learning policy on these clients, which could vary from one client to another where it is beneficial for some clients and not for others. For example, individual clients who do not belong to any community would be forced to learn from top <math id="S2.SS3.SSS5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS3.SSS5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.SS3.SSS5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.SS3.SSS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS3.SSS5.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.SS3.SSS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS3.SSS5.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS3.SSS5.p1.2.m2.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> peers, based on the proposed similarity matrix, however, there is no guarantee that they would be beneficial in the training since they may not belong to the same or similar community. Therefore, we suggest performing a dynamic policy where we could carefully involve the peers based on additional similarities or restricting the peers to a subset who are close enough. Our dynamic learning policy controls the learning stream to the clients where the peers are utilized in the learning process. In short, our goal is to maintain the gain and boost the performance for all clients. In this regard, we propose the following policies.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We test our method on skin dermoscopic images through a set of experiments. Before that, we show proof of concept results of our method and compare it with current SOTA in <code id="S3.p1.2.1" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> for CIFAR10 and FMNIST in image classification tasks in section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Proof-Of-Concept ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>. <code id="S3.p1.2.2" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> outperforms the baselines at different settings.

The results show that peer learning enhances the performance of the models, yet applying PA enhances the communication cost in addition to the performance. After that, we show and discuss how <code id="S3.p1.2.3" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> builds the communities in section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3 Building Communities Results ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3</span></a>. The results show that <code id="S3.p1.2.4" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> clusters the clients into main communities and individual clients thanks to our similarity matrix. Besides, <code id="S3.p1.2.5" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> boosts the overall performance of communities while it has a different effect on the individual clients. Thus, in section <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 The Influence of Peer Learning on Clients ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>, we comment on the impact of the peer learning on the individual clients. <code id="S3.p1.2.6" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> shows superiority and less sensitivity to a noisy client. Then, we dig more deeply and present the classification results for each class in section <a href="#S3.SS5" title="3.5 Class Level Results ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.5</span></a>. Our method enhances the classification for the individual classes, <em id="S3.p1.2.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em> up to 10 times for the DF class. Further, to confirm our findings and for more validation, we present the results using different evaluation metrics in section <a href="#S3.SS6" title="3.6 Additional Evaluation Metrics ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.6</span></a>. Our method is more calibrated and shows superiority over the <code id="S3.p1.2.8" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> in the area under ROC and Precision-Recall curves, risk-coverage curve, and reliably diagrams. The qualitative results are presented in the same section.

To highlight more in the model’s performance at various threshold settings, we plot Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) and Area Under Precision-Recall (AUPR) curves. Note that we follow the One vs ALL methodology for plotting. AUROC shows the model’s ability to discriminate between positive examples and negative examples assuming balance data. Yet, AUPRC is a useful performance metric for imbalanced data, such as our case, where we care about finding positive examples.
Further, we investigate on the uncertainty evaluation and models confidence. Thus, we report Risk-Coverage (RC) curve <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Geifman and El-Yaniv, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, Reliability Diagram (RD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, and Expected and Maximum Calibration errors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ding et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, denoted as ECE and MCE respectively. RC curve plots the risk as a function of the coverage. The coverage denotes the percentage of the input processed by the model without rejection, while the risk denotes the level of
risk of the model’s prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Geifman and El-Yaniv, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.

The higher coverage with lower risk, the better the model is. We refer the readers to section 2 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Geifman and El-Yaniv, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> for the full definition of RC curve.

To calculate the reliability diagrams and calibration errors, we adopted an adaptive binning strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ding et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> that depends on fixable intervals in the calculations. This strategy is more accurate than using fixed intervals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ding et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Practically, we can realize the intervals used from the figure itself. For example, the width of the bars in figures <a href="#S3.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 3.10.2 The unlabeled clients’ results ‣ 3.10 Dynamic Learning Policy ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> and <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 3.8 Generalization to Unseen Client Scenario ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> represents the ranges used to calculate ECE and MCE.</p>

Additionally, our <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">peers anonymization</span> (PA) improves the accuracy and privacy at a low communication cost. Note that PA employs one anonymized peer while <code id="S3.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedMatch</code> uses two clients in the training. Interestingly, the FMNIST dataset results show that our method outperforms <code id="S3.SS1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedProx-SL</code>, which is inconsistent with the CIFAR10 dataset results. Although, these results are not comparable because <code id="S3.SS1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedProx-SL</code> results were taken from the original paper, whereas <code id="S3.SS1.p1.1.9" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> results were generated by our environment. Yet, this could be attributed to the fact that FMNIST images are much simpler than the ones in CIFAR10 yielding more robust similarities and hence producing more accurate pseudo labels.</p>

The improvement of performance is attributed to the carefully designed strategy of creating the anonymized peer, such that the learned knowledge from many models ensembled into a single model. The results confirm the superiority of <code id="S3.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.9" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code>, and show that our peer anonymization is orthogonal and can be easily integrated into other methods without additional complexity.

While we notice that similar clients have achieved similar training behavior, no further improvement in the last stages of the training was observed for all clients. For example, the accuracy for the clients 0-4 between 75-65, while it is between 80-90 for the clients 5-7. Client 9 achieved accuracy that is similar to clients 0-4.

Such negative behavior could represent a threat in the federated learning, where a noisy and out-of-distribution client might hurt other clients and mislead the global model. Yet, the most interesting observation from this experiment that <code id="S3.SS4.p1.11.24" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> is less prone to the negative and noisy impact than <code id="S3.SS4.p1.11.25" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFLs</code>, thanks to the training schema we proposed.
We do not claim that <code id="S3.SS4.p1.11.26" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> is robust against class distribution mismatch, but rather it is less sensitive to a noisy client. Nevertheless, the inconsistency in behavior between clients 8 &amp; 9 could be further investigated.</p>

While the most interesting and surprising results reveal that the lower federated model (Lower <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</code>) is the most calibrated model after the upper model (Upper <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</code>), such that it is better than <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> and <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.7" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> respectively. We can attribute this issue to the uncertainty of using unlabeled data during the training of both models (<code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.8" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> and <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.9" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code>). In contrast to that, the lower and the upper <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.10" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</code> models only trained on high-quality labeled data. Nonetheless, our model has better calibration errors than the <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.11" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code>, where the ECE and MCE are 0.144 and 0.277 for <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.12" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code>, and 0.152 and 0.287 for <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.13" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code>, respectively.

Such lower calibration errors indicate more reliable and confident predictions for the <code id="S3.SS6.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.15" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> over the other methods.

<p id="S3.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of this experiment is to investigate the generalization ability of the federated models to unseen clients. To achieve this, we collect the previously trained global models, including the baselines and <code id="S3.SS8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code>, then we perform inference on the ISIC20 dataset. Note that this dataset consists of more than 33K images with two classes; malignant and benign. Take into consideration that the class distribution is highly imbalanced such that around 500 images contain malignant cases, while the remaining images have benign cases. Also, the models trained to distinguish between 8 classes making the direct inference a very challenging task. To resolve this issue, we perform two steps. First, we generate the eight-class predictions from the models. Then, we assemble these predictions into two groups. The malignant group contains melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, and squamous cell carcinoma classes. The benign group includes melanocytic nevus, benign keratosis, dermatofibroma, and vascular lesions. Then, we generate our metrics as a binary classification task.</p>

Interestingly, <code id="S3.SS8.p2.2.1" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> obtains the best malignant-class classification results outperforming the lower, the <code id="S3.SS8.p2.2.2" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> including <code id="S3.SS8.p2.2.3" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedMatch</code>, and the upper bounds, with F1-score up to 0.178 for <code id="S3.SS8.p2.2.4" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> models. Note that, for clinical applications, the ability of a model to detect the true positive cases (malignant) is high relevant than detecting the true negative cases (benign) because the early detection of cancerous lesions reduces the treatment cost and the death rate. The ability of <code id="S3.SS8.p2.2.5" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> to classify the malignant and benign classes is also shown in the reliability diagrams and calibration errors, <em id="S3.SS8.p2.2.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cf.</em> Fig.<a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 3.8 Generalization to Unseen Client Scenario ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.

<p id="S3.SS10.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Previously, we have shown that the static peer learning policy is constantly beneficial to clients and communities. For instance, see the results in Table <a href="#S3.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 3.4 The Influence of Peer Learning on Clients ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Also, we have shown that for the individual clients, who do not belong to any community, our method is still profitable, as for client 9. Yet, for other clients, <em id="S3.SS10.p1.3.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> client 8, we have seen that peer learning, <code id="S3.SS10.p1.3.2" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedMatch</code>, and <code id="S3.SS10.p1.3.3" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</code> perform lower than the local model. Even though our model is better than the others. To resolve this issue, we propose, in section <a href="#S2.SS3.SSS5" title="2.3.5 Dynamic Learning Policy ‣ 2.3 FedPerl: Peer Learning in SSFL ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3.5</span></a>, a dynamic learning policy that controls the learning stream on the clients.

Because we use this word frequently in our paper and to resolve any ambiguity, we provide the following interpretation. First, we do not use any clustering method nor it is defined heuristically or fixed at the beginning of the federated learning. Hence, we do not assign labels to the clusters, but rather we want to highlight that our similarity matrix works effectively to force similar peers to learn from each other. At the beginning of the training, the clusters, <em id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px7.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> learning from similar peers, are dynamically changed, which is explained by the small numbers in each row in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Proof-Of-Concept ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, where the darker colors or smaller numbers values represent lower frequencies. However, as the training proceeds, these clusters are evolved to force the similar peers to learn from each other more frequently, which is shown by the brighter colors or higher numbers values in the same figure.</span></p>

The effect of <code id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> is diversified between those two clients. While client 9 makes use of <code id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.3" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code>, a drastic drop in the performance of client 8 was noticed, which could be attributed to the class distribution mismatch. This indicates that <code id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.4" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> may not fit non-iid scenarios.
Yet, combining <code id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.5" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> with works that are handling the distribution mismatch (non-iid) problem would be a promising direction of research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Zhao et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
On the other side, one nice property has been shown by our experiments that <code id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.6" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> is less sensitive to the noisy clients than the standard <code id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.7" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> and <code id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.8" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedAvg</code> methods (<em id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.9" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cf.</em> Table. <a href="#S3.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 3.4 The Influence of Peer Learning on Clients ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>), which could be attributed to the learning schema of selecting similar peers in <code id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.10" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code>. <span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px8.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In our experiments, we found out that inductive bias coming from similar in-distribution clients did not hurt the global model, it rather improved the global model performance. Having said that, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) client, e.g., client 8, has shown to harm the model’s performance. If there is a strong inductive bias from a couple of OOD clients, this potentially might hurt the global model. One might need to consider a smarter way of aggregation for such OOD clients. However, this is out of the scope of this manuscript.</span></p>

In this experiment, we tried to show how SSFL models perform in such a challenging situation. The results showed that our model is still better than all baseline models in skin cancer classification shedding the light on the generalization capability.

While this policy is effective in the communities and clients, it suffers in performance when countered by an ODD client. To resolve this issue, we proposed, in this paper, more dynamic and adaptive policies. Specifically, the successful policies employed a gateway to control the learning rate from peers. The participation is measured based on either a global dataset or how similar the peer is to the client. Only the clients who pass a predefined threshold can participate in the training. We found that the results of the two policies are somehow similar with advantages to the one based on similarity. Yet, and most importantly, the performance of the OOD client gets boosted from both policies. Because we do not have control or can not anticipate the in-distribution from out-of-distribution clients, the selection between the static and dynamic methods goes toward the dynamic ones. Even if we know the clients, the results show that the dynamic policy betters the static one. On the other hand, our preference between the validation or similarity gated policies goes toward the similarity. In most cases, the global validation data is not available, which prevents us from applying the validation policy. Further, the gated similarity policy produces more consistent and stable results. Though, the trade-off between the global and local benefits could be the decision-maker in real-life scenarios. <span id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px12.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Our dynamic learning policies are considered heuristic ones, however, they were proposed to address a problem that we noticed in our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bdair et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, where the performance of some individual clients has not improved by the federated learning. We could achieve that by utilizing the global validation dataset or the client similarities. However, to provide a comprehensive study addressing any potential questions from the reader, we tested three different policies. Note that the three policies are separate and work independently. Besides, they have shown to be effective (<em id="S4.SS0.SSS0.Px12.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cf.</em>  Table <a href="#S3.T10" title="Table 10 ‣ 3.10 Dynamic Learning Policy ‣ 3 Experiments and Results ‣ Semi-Supervised Federated Peer Learning for Skin Lesion Classification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>).</span></p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised federated learning framework for skin lesion classification in dermoscopic images. Our method; <code id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> overcomes the limitations of the previous works, inspired by peer learning from educational science and ensemble averaging from committee machines. We show a real-life application of our method that fits the complexity of the medical data <em id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> data heterogeneity, severe class imbalance, and an abundant amount of unlabeled data. Our database consists of 71,000 skin lesion images obtained from 5 public datasets. The testing environment consists of the standard semi-supervised setting and a more challenging and less investigated scenario where clients have access just to the unlabeled data. <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Our method is on par with the state-of-the-art method in skin classification in the standard federated learning, <em id="S5.p1.1.3.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> random set of clients participating in the training</span> and outperforms the baselines and other <code id="S5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">SSFL</code> by 15.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. Moreover, <code id="S5.p1.1.5" class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">FedPerl</code> demonstrates less sensitivity to noisy clients and has better generalization ability to unseen data. Besides, we propose the peer anonymization (PA) technique. PA is a simple and efficient approach to create an anonymized peer and hide clients’ identities. PA enhances performance while reduces communication costs. We show that our method is orthogonal and easy to implement to other methods without additional complexity. In this paper, we investigate two learning policies; a fixed policy that selects the top similar peers, and a dynamic and more adaptive one that controls the learning stream on the clients. We have shown that both strategies are effective with advantages to the dynamic one. Thus far, we exploited the model parameters as similarity measurement, while we could employ different techniques to profile the clients. Further, we could investigate the privacy guarantee for aggregated models as future work.</p>
