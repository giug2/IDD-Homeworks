<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies the feasibility of synthetic data generation for mission-critical applications. The emphasis is on synthetic data generation for anomalous detection in complex social networks. In particular, the development of a heuristic generative model, capable of creating data for anomalous rare activities in complex social networks is sought. To this end, lessons from social and political literature are applied to prototype a novel implementation of the Agent-based Modeling (ABM) framework, based on simple social interactions between agents, for synthetic data generation in the context of terrorist profile desegregation. The conclusion offers directions for further verification, fine-tuning, and proposes future directions of work for the ABM prototype, as a complex-societal approach to synthetic data generation, by identifying heuristic hyper-parameter tuning methodologies to further ensure the generated data distribution is similar to the true distribution of the original data-sets. While a rigorous mathematical optimization for reducing the distances in distributions is not offered in this work, we opine that this prototype of an autonomous-agent generative complex social model is useful for studying and researching on pattern of life and anomaly detection where there is strict limitation or lack of sufficient data for using practical machine learning solutions in mission-critical applications.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite consistent work towards lowering of crime rates, societies remain fragile and vulnerable to crime.
Knowledge of past events enforced by spatial coordinates of crime showed to be vital in rare events such as disaster and crime management (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). In consequence, many attempts have been made to understand crime, predict its patterns, as well as determine possible profiles of suspected people. Research of this network of relationships showed consistent positive impact in efficient resource allocation (officers, vehicles, surveillance cameras, etc.) and concrete results (<span id="Sx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>).
However, recorded information on crime is highly variable depending on type of crime and location. Additionally, grave or organized crime, such as terrorism, is a sporadic occurrence.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In most countries, terrorism accounts for an average of <math id="Sx1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.01" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="Sx1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0.01</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx1.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="float" id="Sx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx1.p2.1.m1.1.1">0.01</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx1.p2.1.m1.1c">0.01</annotation></semantics></math> % of the total deaths Figure <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ On synthetic data generation for anomaly detection in complex social networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (<span id="Sx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). Yet every attack causes a serious negative psychological impact on society and constitutes significant disruptions. For example, the 9/11 attacks costed the US over 100 billion dollars and terrorist attacks between 2004-2016 cost the European Union over 180 billion Euros (<span id="Sx1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). Our limited understanding of such events comes in part, from them being a <span id="Sx1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">rare event problem</span>.
Its erratic occurrence and non-traditional crime triggers add to the fear it instills.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In consequence, recorded data are inherently insufficient for quantitative studies, essential in the modeling, establishing reliable patterns, and generating analysis for prevention and early conflict mitigation. As with other instances where we do not have sufficient collected data, scientists are used to augmenting with synthetic data, following main parameters and features.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Producing synthetic data that exhibits similar threats as real data would be useful to augment collected data points. It could provide an <span id="Sx1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">additional avenue to study sensitive information, otherwise unavailable due to scarcity or classification</span>. Subsequently the ability to produce synthetic data that follows the characteristics of recorded data would allow utilizing modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, mostly unavailable to this point for this problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To produce synthetic data in the absence of an established distribution, scientists could employ the Gaussian distribution. However, this distribution would not produce long tails, typically associated with rare events, thus not capturing rare events happening within three <math id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\sigma}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mi id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">σ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1b"><ci id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1.1">𝜎</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1c">{\sigma}</annotation></semantics></math> standard deviations (<span id="Sx1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>).

More so, records about people convicted of terrorism include other criminal activities (<span id="Sx1.SSx1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). Yet small fundamental distinguishing differences between other types of crime, about which we have more data, and terrorist activities, in which recorded data is limited, make the more restrictive samples unsuitable for transfer knowledge, because of the crime motive.</p>

<div id="Sx1.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In most types of crime, the criminal seeks a personal benefit of some sort; however terrorists often times are serving an ideology and consider their acts as personal altruist sacrifice (<span id="Sx1.SSx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>).
Initially our team sought a transfer knowledge methodology between terrorism and other areas of crime in which more data has been captured. Yet because many terrorist acts are committed in the name of altruism, the lessons we learned in predictive policing (an area of law enforcement that uses data from disparate sources and predictive analytic techniques to gather information and use for crime prevention and increased efficiency of response to future crime) do not transfer to the study of terrorism.</p>

So in an area where descriptive or prescriptive theories alone do not transfer well, ABM uses a simple set of rules to describe a complex process. Among first ABM models to raise to prominence, was Thomas Schelling’s Segregation Model (1971). Its implementation went on to win the Nobel prize, and subsequently was automated in many applications (<span id="Sx1.SSx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>).

<p id="Sx1.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we present empirical evidence of a potential solution to producing synthetic data that follows recorded distributions for terrorist events. We do this by
creating adaptive agents and interaction rules, subsequently allowing the society to evolve and mature.
The novelty of our work is in modeling terrorist interaction based on desegregated terrorist profiles. We recognized terrorist activity as only one small part of the societal interactions, therefore propose a simulation of holistic societal interactions within a geographical region.
In this work we are basing the agent profiles on political science research to offer an interdisciplinary insight into the problem. To carry out a simulation of a modeled society in which terrorist activity exists, we follow research based evidence proven reliable in qualitative studies from social and political sciences (<span id="Sx1.SSx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). The political research shades light on the importance of dis-aggregating terrorist profiles. We model this desegregation using mathematical distributions and computer simulations to create individual agents that interact in the resulting complex environment (<span id="Sx1.SSx3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). To the further nuance the initial criteria, data is extracted from different geographic regions, with known distinctive profiles, and applied as a subsequent rule.</p>

The probability of success of such an action, will be modeled through a logistic distribution. If the probability from the logistic distribution is greater for a certain role, the individual is recruited to this role. Whenever an agent has interaction with its own kind their power increases. However, when a police individual meets a terrorist, nothing happens until they exceed a set level of power threshold. Once a leader has at least three underlings and has accumulated enough power, the leader can begin to plan an attack, if a connection with a financier profile of enough power is present. Now if the police personnel interacts with a terrorist, then the terrorist can be arrested. The the success of the attack comes from a logistic distribution based on the power, number of terrorist, and right probabilistic context from the other agents they are connected with. If for any reason an agent is removed from the environment, its place is replaced with a new agent with profile values matching the initial environment setup. A set of simple rules for outcome of an interaction is presented in Algorithm 2.</p>

Figure 2 (a) shows the predisposition after 2000 runs the population is highly in favor of the police, and there is some neutrality. In Figure 2 (b), we show the predisposition distribution after 3000 runs. Here we notice that there is significantly higher predisposition towards terrorism. The population evolves very fast in the next runs into a strong divide of agent polarization as shown in Figure 2 (c).
For this runs we are showing the types of actions that take place in the synthetic environment. At the beginning, the environment is initialized with a normal distribution of profiles. Figures 2 (d), (e) and (f) show the model evolution over time and we notice the elongation of right-hand tails, which models the terrorist attacks. Over time the events remain very rare in the synthetic environment.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This exploratory work at the intersection of political science and modeling in computer science, takes the theoretical research of rare events, one step further by implementing interdisciplinary concepts. The simulation of an entire society including terrorist profiles as an unbounded network linked by affinity, showed initial evidence towards producing pertinent synthetic data for mission critical applications.</p>

<div id="Sx3.SSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Further investigations are needed to fine-tune the role of each variable. So far we validated the results under different assumptions using various modalities of sampling. We notice a slight predisposition preference for the weights in our initial hypothesis and chanced to employ LHS. We compared the mean and variance distribution of data extracted from the synthetic distribution with the data from real events. For deadly events in the RAND-MIPT data-set we record a low mean of 4.2 and a very high variance of 727. This matches our synthetic environment mean and variance just before 4000 ticks (mean 3.1, variance 748), when the population becomes strongly divided. The model’s convergence or not, in this case, does not speak for an agent-based-model’s competence, but for its fine tuning.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h2>

<div id="Sx4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this manuscript we propose a novel approach for generating synthetic data that triggers anomaly detection in complex social networks. This interdisciplinary research brings political-social innovation into data sciences; bridging mature qualitative research from other areas of science into computer science modelling. To do so, a set of societal rules were used to prototype an autonomous multi-agent synthetic environment with self-organized terrorist behavior within the context of a whole society. Subsequently, we prototype extraction of long tailed synthetic data-set that showed basic measures of similar mathematical distributions to collected data (<span id="Sx4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>): density, mean, and variance. This methodology could serve as a guideline to develop more sophisticated mathematical rigors towards data generation for practical machine learning with strict limitation or lack of sufficient recorded data.
We have also identified some challenges and propose future research directions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly we want to focus on the sensitivity condition. The model is sensitive to the primary initial conditions dealing with adaptive intelligent agents profiles. Evidence of sensitivity of our dis-aggregated profiles behavior is shown in the graph 2(c) where the society becomes segregated. However the model does not show substantially sensitive to our subsequent (nice-to-have) geographical conditions. Since the geographical conditions are a secondary, independent set of restrictions, we believe fine tuning of the model would address these.
With regards to the number of iterations, we opine that the model shows the right behavior. At about 4000 ticks it becomes highly segregated and if we continue the runs (which we do not show in this paper) it continues this pattern we were expecting to see. This shows our agents are eager to maximize their objective function.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While proving a valid initial proof of concept for desegregation of rare events given a set of premises we notice the necessity of a visual environment to allow fine tuning of the conditions, as opposed to only measuring the mathematics. To this end, we propose future work implementation of our algorithm in NetLogo. NetLogo is a free, multi-agent programmable modeling environment, developed by Uri Wilensky, at The Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, at Northwestern University(<span id="Sx4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>). This interactive programming environment accounts for the ability to fine tune input parameters and visually observe the effect it has on the synthetic society. Here we would aim for a model that does not converge, allowing the world to keep on going, with continuous rare events taking place. A NetLogo implementation would visually show how each condition corroborates in the overall environment and help identify optimal tuning.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, we propose introducing some factors that would model the probability of Perceived Mission Risk of Detection and enforcing the reward (Ilachinski, 2012). We propose stricter identification of distance between input variants and output distributions in the temporal context of runs. As a future direction we propose expanding the focus to generating synthetic data in this domain that matches complex overall distributions, and follows more rigorous mathematical properties. One of the metrics KL divergence, in addition to checking for co-variance structure, outliers, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly we think future work research would benefit from introduction of time varying constrains in relation to objectives and parameters for more practical optimization problem as it relates to the evolution of agents in the synthetic environment (<span id="Sx4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">?</span>).</p>
