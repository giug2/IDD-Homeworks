<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have witnessed a large amount of decentralized data in various (edge) devices of end-users, while the decentralized data aggregation remains complicated for machine learning jobs because of regulations and laws.
As a practical approach to handling decentralized data, Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative global machine learning model training without sharing sensitive raw data.
The servers schedule devices to jobs within the training process of FL.
In contrast, device scheduling with multiple jobs in FL remains a critical and open problem.
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-job FL framework, which enables the training process of multiple jobs in parallel.
The multi-job FL framework is composed of a system model and a scheduling method.
The system model enables a parallel training process of multiple jobs, with a cost model based on the data fairness and the training time of diverse devices during the parallel training process.
We propose <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">a novel intelligent scheduling approach based on multiple scheduling methods, including an original reinforcement learning-based scheduling method and an original Bayesian optimization-based scheduling method,</span> which corresponds to a small cost while scheduling devices to multiple jobs.
We conduct extensive experimentation with diverse jobs and datasets.
The experimental results reveal that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of training time (up to <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">12.73</span> times faster) and accuracy (up to <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">46.4</span>% higher).</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, we have witnessed a large amount of decentralized data over various Internet of Things (IoT) devices, mobile devices, etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which can be exploited to train machine learning models of high accuracy for diverse artificial intelligence applications. Since the data contain sensitive information of end-users, a few stringent legal restrictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> have been put in place to protect data security and privacy. In this case, it is difficult or even impossible to aggregate the decentralized data into a single server or a data center to train machine learning models. To enable collaborative training with decentralized data, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which does not transfer raw data, have emerged as <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">a</span> practical approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL was first introduced to collaboratively train a global model with non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data distributed across mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
During the training process of FL, the raw data remains decentralized without being transferred to a single server or a single data center <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
FL only allows the intermediate data to be transferred from the distributed devices, which can be the weights or the gradients of a model.
FL generally utilizes a parameter server architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, where a server (or a group of servers) coordinates the training process with numerous devices.
To collaboratively train a global model, the server selects (schedules) several devices to perform local model updates based on their local data, and then it aggregates the local models to obtain a new global model.
This process is repeated multiple times to generate a global model of high accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While current FL solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> focus on a single-task job or a multi-task job <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, FL with multiple jobs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> remains an open problem. The major difference between the multi-task job and multiple jobs is that the tasks of the multi-task job share some common parts of the model, while the multiple jobs do not interact with each other in terms of the model. The multi-job FL deals with the simultaneous training process of multiple independent jobs. Each job corresponds to multiple updates during the training process of a global model with the corresponding decentralized data. While the FL with a single job generally selects a portion of devices to update the model, the other devices remain idle, and the efficiency thus is low. The multi-job FL can well exploit diverse devices for multiple jobs simultaneously, which brings high efficiency. The available devices are generally heterogeneous <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, i.e., the computing and communication capacity of each device is different, and the data in each device may also differ. <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">For instance, multiple machine learning jobs, e.g., CTR models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, mobile keyboard prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and travel time prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, may be concurrently executed with FL. The concurrent execution can be carried out with the same group of users. In addition, industry-level machine learning jobs, e.g., recommendation system jobs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, etc., may be adapted to be executed in parallel with FL for privacy issues. </span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">During the training process of multiple jobs, the devices need to be scheduled for each job. At a given time, a device can be scheduled to one job. However, only a portion of the available devices are scheduled to one job to reduce the influence of stragglers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Powerful devices should be scheduled to jobs to accelerate the training process, while other eligible devices should also participate in the training process to increase the fairness of data to improve the accuracy of the final global models. The fairness of data refers to the fair participation of the data in the training process of FL, which can be indicated by the standard deviation of the times to be scheduled to a job <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

In addition, these methods either cannot address the heterogeneity of devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, or do not consider the data fairness during the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, which may lead to low accuracy.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to protect the security and privacy of decentralized raw data, FL emerges as a promising approach, which enables training a global model with decentralized data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Based on the data distribution, FL can be classified into three types, i.e., horizontal, vertical, and hybrid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The horizontal FL addresses the decentralized data of the same features, while the identifications are different. The vertical FL handles the decentralized data of the same identifications with different features. The hybrid FL deals with the data of different identifications and different features. In addition, FL includes two variants: cross-device FL and cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The cross-device FL trains global machine learning models with a huge number of mobile or IoT devices, while the cross-silo FL handles the collaborative training process with the decentralized data from multiple organizations or geo-distributed datacenters. In this paper, we focus on the horizontal and cross-device FL.</p>

The scheduling methods in the above works are mainly based on some heuristics. For instance, the greedy method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and the random scheduling method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> are proposed for FL, while genetic algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> are exploited for distributed systems. However, these methods do not consider the fairness of data, which may lead to low accuracy for multi-job FL. The black-box optimization-based methods, e.g., RL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, BO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and deep neural network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, have been proposed to improve the efficiency, i.e., the reduction of execution time, in distributed systems. They do not consider data fairness either, which may lead to low accuracy for multi-job FL. <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Although ensemble learning or ensemble method consisting of multiple models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, has been exploited for scheduling parallel tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, proper cost models and ensemble mechanism should be well designed.</span></p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Let us assume a scenario where multiple FL jobs are processed simultaneously, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, and text generation. These jobs can be trained in parallel to exploit the available devices efficiently. However, while each device can only update the model of one job at a given time slot, it is critical to schedule devices to different jobs during the training process.
As the devices are generally heterogeneous, some may possess high computation or communication capability while others may not.
In addition, the data fairness of multiple devices may also impact the convergence speed of the training process.
For instance, if only specific powerful devices are scheduled for a job, the model can only learn from the data stored on these devices, while the knowledge from the data stored on other devices may be missed. In order to accelerate the training process of multiple jobs with high accuracy, it is critical to consider how to schedule devices while considering both the computing and communication capability and the data fairness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A straightforward approach is to train each job separately using the mechanism explained in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, while exploiting the existing scheduling of single-job FL, e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
In this way, simple parallelism is considered while the devices are not fully utilized and the system is of low efficiency.
In addition, a direct adaptation of existing scheduling methods to multi-job FL cannot address the efficiency and the accuracy at the same time.
Thus, it is critical to propose a reasonable and effective approach for the multi-job FL.</p>

We design a multi-job FL process as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.2.1 Multi-job FL Process ‣ 3.2 Multi-job Federated Learning Framework ‣ 3 System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The Server first initializes a global model for each job. The initialization can be implemented randomly or from the pre-training process with public data. To know the current status of devices, the Server sends requests to available devices in Step ①. Then, in Step ②, the Server schedules devices for the current job based on the scheduling plan generated by the scheduling method (see details in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Device Scheduling for Multi-job FL ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). The scheduling plan is a set of devices selected to execute the local training process of the current job. Note that the scheduling process generates a scheduling plan for each job during the training process of multiple jobs, i.e., with an online strategy, while the scheduling processes for multiple jobs are carried out in parallel. The Server distributes the latest global model for the current job to the scheduled devices in Step ③, and then the model is updated in each device based on the local data in Step ④. Afterward, each device sends the updated model to the Server after its local training in Step ⑤. Finally, the Server aggregates the models of scheduled devices to generate a new global model in Step ⑥. The combination of Steps ① - ⑥ is denoted by a round, which is repeated for each job until the corresponding global model reaches the expected performance (accuracy, loss value, or convergence). Please note that multiple jobs are executed in parallel asynchronously, while a device can only be scheduled to one job at a given time. In addition, we assume that each job is of equal importance.</p>

RLDS favors complex jobs, as it can learn the influence among diverse devices. The influence refers to the concurrent, complementary, and latent impacts of the data in multiple devices for diverse jobs. However, BODS favors simple jobs, while it relies on simple statistical knowledge. The complexity of jobs is determined by the number of parameters of models and the size of the training dataset. We consider the probability to release the devices in <math id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{V}_{o}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" mathcolor="#000000" id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒱</mi><mi mathcolor="#000000" id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">o</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝒱</ci><ci id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑜</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p2.1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{V}_{o}</annotation></semantics></math> in BODS and RLDS, and possible concurrent occupation of other devices for other jobs, which is not explained in the paper to simplify the explanation. During the execution, we assume that a fraction of the devices is sampled for each job and some devices can be unavailable for the execution. In order to optimize the scheduling process for diverse types of models, we further propose a meta-greedy scheduling approach, which takes advantage of multiple scheduling methods and chooses the most appropriate scheduling plan from the results of the scheduling methods.</span></p>

Some scheduling methods, e.g., BODS, favor simple jobs, while some other scheduling methods, e.g., RLDS, prefer complex jobs.

We have similar observations with IID, while the advantage of Meta-Greedy is much more significant (up to 19.0 times shorter in terms of the time for a single job) than that of non-IID as shown in Tables <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table IV ‣ 5 Convergence Analysis ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> and <a href="#S5.T5" title="Table V ‣ 5 Convergence Analysis ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. Besides, we can find that our proposed method (i.e., Meta-Greedy) leads to a better performance in the case of non-IID data due to dynamically enhancing the impact of data fairness to decrease the imbalance of devices.</span></p>

The Genetic method can exploit randomness to achieve data fairness while generating scheduling plans, and the convergence performance is better than the Greedy method. The FedCS method optimizes the scheduling plan by randomly selecting devices, which improves the fairness of the device to a certain extent, and convergences faster than the Random method. <span id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">We carry out an experiment with Group A with both IID and non-IID distribution, and find that Meta-Greedy with 6 methods significantly outperforms that with 2 methods in terms of accuracy (up to 0.091) and training speed (up to 65%) (see details in Appendix). In addition, after analyzing the log of the training process (see details in Appendix), we find Greedy and Genetic are extensively exploited, RLDS is selected at the beginning of the training process, BODS is chosen at the end of the training process, FedCS participates with less frequency, and Random is seldomly utilized. As Meta-Greedy can intelligently select a proper scheduling plan based on available methods, it results in a more efficient training process.</span></p>

As shown in Figures <a href="#S6.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 6.2.2 Comparison within MJ-FL ‣ 6.2 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> and <a href="#S6.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 6.2.2 Comparison within MJ-FL ‣ 6.2 Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, the data fairness improves both the convergence speed (up to 9.35 times faster) and the accuracy (up to 15.3%).

In most cases, considering data fairness reduces the convergence speed and essentially does not affect the convergence accuracy. There are few cases that the job fails to achieve the convergence accuracy.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed a new Multi-Job Federated Learning framework, i.e., MJ-FL. The framework is composed of a system model and three device scheduling methods. The system model is composed of a process for the parallel execution of multiple jobs and a cost model based on the capability of devices and data fairness. <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">We proposed three device scheduling methods, i.e., RLDS for complex jobs and BODS for simple jobs, while Meta-Greedy for both complex and simple jobs, to efficiently schedule proper devices for each job based on the cost model. We carried out extensive experimentation with six real-life models and four datasets with IID and non-IID distribution. The experimental results show that MJ-FL outperforms the single-job FL, and that our proposed scheduling methods, i.e., BODS and RLDS, significantly outperform baseline methods (up to 44.6% in terms of accuracy, 12.6 times faster for a single job and 5.81 times faster for the total time). In addition, Meta-Greedy, the intelligent scheduling approach based on multiple scheduling methods (including the two proposed methods, i.e., RODS and BODS) significantly outperforms other methods (up to 46.4% in terms of accuracy, 12.73 times faster for a single job and 8.16 times faster for the total time).

<p id="Sx1.SSx2.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We carried out an experimentation with 20 real devices (mobile devices) and a parameter server on the Baidu AI Cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite>. The devices are summarized in Table <a href="#Sx1.T8" title="Table VIII ‣ Experimentation with Real Mobile Devices ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Appendix ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a>. We carry out the experimentation with a synthetic CNN model of 4 layers, a VGG model of 6 layers, and a ResNet model of 13 layers.</p>

<div id="Sx1.SSx2.SSSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx2.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The time to achieve target accuracy is shown in Table <a href="#Sx1.T7" title="Table VII ‣ Proof of Theorem 1 ‣ Appendix ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>. From the table, we can find that Meta-Greedy corresponds to the shortest time (up to 42.4% shorter than others) to achieve the target accuracy of simple models, i.e. CNN and VGG, while BODS outperforms baseline methods (up to 35.7%). With a complex model, i.e., ResNet, Meta-Greedy corresponds to excellent efficient training (up to 23.5% compared with others) for a low target accuracy (0.680) while RLDS significantly outperforms baseline methods (up to 36.2%) for a high target accuracy (0.808). This result implies that RLDS favors complex models while BODS favors simple models.</p>

Due to the emphasis on the combination of data fairness and device capabilities, i.e.,computation and communication capabilities, BODS can lead to high convergence accuracy and fast convergence speed for simple jobs (0.018 in terms of accuracy and 38% faster for the target accuracy of 0.97 with CNN; see details in Appendix).</p>

<p id="Sx1.SSx2.SSSx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure <a href="#Sx1.F17" title="Figure 17 ‣ RLDS &amp; BODS with Simple and Complex Jobs ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Appendix ‣ Multi-Job Intelligent Scheduling with Cross-Device Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>, Meta-Greedy with 2 methods (BODS and RLDS) significantly outperforms that with 6 methods (BODS, RLDS, Genetic, Greedy, Random, and FedCS). We find that Greedy and Genetic are extensively exploited, RLDS is selected at the beginning of the training process, BODS is chosen at the end of the training process, FedCS participates with less frequency, and Random is seldomly utilized. This result shows that when there are Greedy, Genetic, FedCS, and RLDS, Meta-Greedy can combine them to generate better scheduling plans for a simple job (LeNet with IID). When the job becomes complex, Meta-Greedy combines Greedy, Genetic, FedCS, RLDS, and BODS to generate proper scheduling plans (LeNet with non-IID, CNN with both IID and non-IID). However, when the job becomes even more complex, Meta-Greedy exploits more frequently RLDS and BODS. RLDS is utilized at the beginning of the training process because of its superior performance while BODS is exploited at the end. As BODS may introduce some randomness to the scheduling process, it may correspond to better data fairness and higher accuracy at the end. Please note that does not contradict with the claim “BODS favors simple jobs and RLDS favors complex jobs” as the combination of Greedy and Genetic can well address the simple jobs and the training process is quite different from that of a single scheduling method. As Meta-Greedy can intelligently select a proper scheduling plan based on method, it corresponds to efficiency training process.</p>
