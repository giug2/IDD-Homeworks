<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, as a promising machine learning approach, has emerged to leverage a distributed personalized dataset from a number of nodes, e.g., mobile devices, to improve performance while simultaneously providing privacy preservation for mobile users. In the federated learning, training data is widely distributed and maintained on the mobile devices as workers. A central aggregator updates a global model by collecting local updates from mobile devices using their local training data to train the global model in each iteration. However, unreliable data may be uploaded by the mobile devices (i.e., workers), leading to frauds in tasks of federated learning. The workers may perform unreliable updates intentionally, e.g., the data poisoning attack, or unintentionally, e.g., low-quality data caused by energy constraints or high-speed mobility. Therefore, finding out trusted and reliable workers in federated learning tasks becomes critical. In this article, the concept of reputation is introduced as a metric. Based on this metric, a reliable worker selection scheme is proposed for federated learning tasks. Consortium blockchain is leveraged as a decentralized approach for achieving efficient reputation management of the workers without repudiation and tampering. By numerical analysis, the proposed approach is demonstrated to improve the reliability of federated learning tasks in mobile networks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Mobile devices, such as smart phones or vehicles, equipped with a variety of sensors generate a huge amount and diverse types of user data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Recently, for greatly improving mobile services and enabling smarter mobile applications, it is increasingly popular to utilize machine learning technologies to train models on such user data, e.g., service recommendation and mobile healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, a majority of machine learning technologies require a large amount of user data with sensitive privacy information to be aggregated in a central server for model training and analysis. This results in exorbitant communication and storage cost, and the mobile users are at risk of serious privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the privacy challenges, a decentralized machine learning paradigm called federated learning has been proposed to enable mobile devices (e.g., vehicles) to collaboratively train a global model required by a central aggregator (i.e., a task publisher) in a decentralized manner, without the need of centrally storing raw training data. In the federated learning, the mobile devices download a global model from the central aggregator in each iteration, and then train and improve the current global model by using their local raw data. The mobile devices send the local model updates to the central aggregator. By aggregating these local model updates, the central aggregator generates a new global model for the next iteration. Both the mobile devices and the central aggregator repeat the above process until the global model achieves a certain accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. This paradigm significantly reduces risks of sensitive privacy leakage by decoupling of model training from the need for direct access to the raw training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although federated learning brings great benefits for mobile networks, it is still susceptible to various adversarial attacks in its primary stage. That is, during a federated learning process, data owners may mislead a global model by intentional or unintentional behaviours <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. For intentional behaviors, an attacker can send malicious updates, i.e., the poisoning attack, to affect the global model parameters resulting in the failure of current collaborative learning. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> demonstrated the vulnerability of federated learning to sybil-based poisoning through experiments, and showed that existing defenses to such attacks are ineffective.
In addition, much more dynamic mobile networking environments indirectly result in some unintentional behaviors of data owners. The data owners may also indeliberately update low-quality models caused by high-speed mobility or energy limitation, thus adversely affecting the federated learning. Therefore, it is of paramount importance for federated learning to defend against such intentionally and unintentionally unreliable local model updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we propose that reputation can be used to provide solutions to select reliable and trusted workers for the federated learning tasks. Existing studies show that reputation can reflect the rating of how reliable or trusted an entity is in certain activities according to its historical behaviors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Along with this direction, we are motivated to treat the reputation as a fair metric and design a reputation-based worker (i.e., data owner) selection scheme for reliable federated learning. With the help of reputation, each task publisher selects only high-reputation workers to eliminate the impact from unreliable workers, thereby leading to high accuracy of the learning task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Each task publisher calculates reputation opinions of every interacting worker through a subjective logic model. In the subjective logic model, the task publishers integrate their own opinions based on past interactions and recommended opinions from other task publishers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. All the reputation opinions of the task publishers for the workers should be recorded in a non-repudiation and tamper-resistance manner for reliable reputation calculation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To realize reliable reputation calculation as well as reputation management in federated learning, we design a consortium blockchain acting as a trusted and decentralized ledger to record and manage the data owners’ reputation. The consortium blockchains are specific blockchains that perform the consensus process on pre-selected miners with mild cost in a short time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In the mobile networks, edge nodes, e.g., roadside units and based stations, are commonly deployed over the networks and easily reachable by task publishers and mobile devices, can be the pre-selected miners owing to having sufficient storage and computation resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The reputation values of the data owners are securely managed and stored on the consortium blockchain consisting of the edge nodes. The consortium blockchain is an efficient and practical blockchain technology running light-weight and fast consensus mechanisms on the miners.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional machine learning methods train models by using training data stored in a centralized server or dataset. But these methods face several critical challenges including single point of failure, sensitive data leakage, and huge overhead to collect and store the training data. To overcome these challenges, Google introduced a promising technique named federated learning that allows distributed mobile devices to collectively train a global model using their raw data while keeping these data locally stored on the mobile devices. Every mobile device computes a local update, for example via a distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, and uploads the local update, i.e., weight parameters of current global model, to a central aggregator. The central aggregator, e.g., a central server, collects all the local updates and calculates the average value of these local updates as a new global model. The federated learning significantly improves privacy protection of the mobile devices through blocking attack surfaces for direct access to the raw training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the federated learning is promising to be applied in mobile environments, some critical challenges exist including reliable and trusted worker selection problems for model training. On the one hand, due to the openness and complexity of mobile network architectures, the data owners performing maliciously unreliable updates may result from: (i) sensing data from malicious intent or tampered devices may include deceptive information, which is similar to false data injection attacks in smart grids <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>; (ii) the data can be arbitrarily manipulated when being transmitted through insecure communication channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. If a malicious data owner is selected to be a worker, the malicious worker may intentionally launch or collude with other workers to launch attacks, such as <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">poisoning attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. For the poisoning attacks, malicious workers deliberately tamper with a fraction of training data or inject poisonous data into the training datasets to increase the probability of misclassification thus manipulating the results of training models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, the data owners may inadvertently provide unreliable local update from low-quality raw data because of energy constraints or high-speed mobility. Both the intentional and unintentional behaviors can degrade the quality of the global model managed by a central aggregator<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>We assume that the central aggregator is not compromised or malicious.</span></span></span>, hence affecting the final outputs of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is vitally important to design a reliable worker selection scheme during model training. Nevertheless, in the federated learning, the following challenges for the worker selection need to be addressed.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the great potential of reputation in solving data quality problems in crowdsensing, we adopt the reputation metric to the selection of trusted and reliable workers for enhancing model training performance in the federated learning. The reputation can reflect how well a worker has performed about model training, which can be measured from its training task completion history with the past behaviors of good or unreliable activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.  With the help of reputation, task publishers select trusted and reliable workers to train the global model well, which can prevent the poisoning attacks launched by malicious workers and also remove unreliable data providers for obtaining high accuracy of the global model. The recent studies on federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> have indicated that a central aggregator is vulnerable to security problems, e.g., single point of failure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In this article, to avoid the potential risks of central reputation calculation and management, we employ a decentralized reputation calculation method named subjective logic model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and a consortium blockchain with the properties of immutability and decentralization to realize secure reputation management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Compared with centralized reputation management, consortium blockchain as a decentralized ledger can manage the reputation in a real-time and parallel manner without large computation overload. Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the consortium blockchain performs the consensus process on pre-selected miners with mild cost in a short time, which is particularly suitable and practical for mobile networks because of light-weight and faster consensus agreement. More details about the reputation management and the subjective logic model for reputation calculation are presented in Section III-B and Section IV, respectively.</p>

The task publisher first randomly chooses an initial SGD model (i.e., initial parameters) from predefined ranges as the global model. This initial SGD model is received by selected workers and the workers collaboratively train the global model by using their own local data. The workers generate local model updates and the corresponding local computation time and upload these information to the task publisher. The local computation time is used to verify the reliability and authenticity of local model updates by comparing the data size of training data, in which the local computation time is proportional to the data size. To ensure the truthfulness of local computation time, we consider employing the proof of elapsed time method under the Intel’s SGX technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. After validating the computation time, the task publisher can determine the “lazy” workers that have not trained all of the local data.</p>

<div id="S3.I1.i4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.I1.i4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, some poisoning attack detection schemes are carried out by the task publisher to identify the poisoning attacks and unreliable workers. Typical detection schemes include Reject on Negative Influence (RONI) scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> for Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) scenarios and FoolsGold scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> for non-IID scenarios.
With the help of these schemes, the task publisher removes malicious updates from poisoning attacks and unreliable local model updates from the lazy or untrusted workers. Then, the task publisher generates a new global model by calculating the average of the rest of local model updates.
Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, we consider that the distribution of data among mobile devices is sufficiently uniform to enable the RONI work well in gradient validation.
The task publisher sends the new global model to the selected workers for the next model iteration until the global model meets the predefined convergence conditions. The workers obtain rewards from the task publisher according to their data contribution and model training behaviors for the federated learning task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. During the federated learning process, either the lazy and unreliable workers or the workers with poisoning attackers in each model iteration are recorded as a negative interaction by the task publisher.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To assess the trustworthiness of a worker candidate, reputation opinions from task publishers should be collected and integrated into a composite reputation value of the worker candidate for secure worker selection. We therefore utilize the subjective logic model to calculate composite reputation values of worker candidates. Subjective logic is widely used to evaluate the trust level between different entities in the networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which is a specific framework of uncertain reasoning that uses a belief metric named “opinion” to represent a subjective beliefs about the world. The opinion is denoted by a tuple consisted of belief, distrust, and uncertainty to express the subjective belief of an entity or an event. For example, in vehicular networks, a task publisher performs a federated learning-based traffic prediction service with the help of vehicles. The task publisher’s subjective belief for a vehicle increases if the publisher believes that the model updates provided by the vehicle are high-quality without the external impacts of unstable communication link between them, and vice versa.
All reputation opinions from task publishers are securely updated and stored in the decentralized reputation blockchain. Every task publisher selects workers by calculating composite reputation values according to its local reputation opinion and recommend reputation opinions.

Mobile devices acting as workers are vulnerable if there is no sufficient security protection. Therefore, the workers are not always reliable or trusted in federated learning.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate performance of the proposed schemes, we perform simulation on a well-known digit classification dataset named MNIST by using Tensorflow 1.12.0 for a digit classification. This dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. We consider ten workers in this federated learning task including two malicious workers who launch poisoning attacks, four unreliable workers with low-quality data, and four well-behaved workers.
The training sets of the well-behaved workers are randomly assigned but follows a uniform distribution over 10 classes. The data in each unreliable worker is only assigned a certain number of classes randomly. We employ the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) as a metric to measure training data quality of the unreliable workers. Here, the EMD is expressed by the probability distance for a worker’s data distribution compared with the actual distribution for the whole population <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. For the malicious workers launching poisoning attacks, they randomly receive training data with 10 classes. However, the labels of some training examples are intentionally modified for misleading training.
The percentage of the modified training examples is used to indicate the attack strength. The workers use a batch of 32 randomly sampled training examples to produce a local SGD update, and every global model is trained with 5 synchronous iterations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Without loss of generality, the computation overhead of local model training is a constant overhead on each worker in the simulation. We establish the reputation blockchain system on the Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0 and use the practical and efficient PBFT algorithm with mild overhead and latency as the consensus algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

The unsuccessful transmission probability of data packets ranges from 0% to 40%, and the initial reputation of all the workers is 0.5.
We compare the proposed MSL scheme with a Traditional Subjective Logic (TSL) scheme from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and an Aggregated Trust Value (ATV) scheme referred to  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. In the ATV scheme, reputation is calculated by aggregating trust value offsets with different weights from the task publishers.

There are three factors that affect the learning accuracy: EMD, attacker number, and attack strength. The increase of any one of the above factors leads to the decrease of accuracy. The unreliable and untrusted workers with low-quality training data have negative impacts on the accuracy. For example, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Simulation Setting ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Reliable Federated Learning for Mobile Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the learning accuracy in the case with two attackers is only 76.12%, which is 7.7% lower than that with one attack when EMD is 1.6 and the attack strength is 0.9.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To illustrate the reputation change of a malicious or unreliable worker, we set that this worker performs well in the former 6 federated tasks on purpose to increase its reputation value. Then, the worker trains local models on its poisoning or unreliable examples for 30 task publishers with the probability of 0.8. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-B Performance Results ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Reliable Federated Learning for Mobile Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, when the worker performs misbehaviours, its reputation begins to decrease in the MSL, TSL and ATV schemes, but is still linearly increasing in the scheme without reputation defenses. Due to considering the interaction effects, frequency and timeline, the reputation of the MSL scheme has a sharper and larger decrease than those in the ATV and TSL schemes in a short time. Moreover, the reputation of the ATV scheme drops faster than that of the MSL scheme after 12 iterations because the ATV scheme merely focuses on the interaction effects when calculating trust value offsets.</p>

If a worker’s calculated reputation is below the given reputation threshold, the worker will be treated as a malicious or unreliable worker.

Although the accuracy of the MSL scheme is lower than that of the ATV scheme under lower reputation thresholds, the MSL scheme has the same performance as that of the ATV scheme when the reputation is higher than 0.35. The reason is that the ATV scheme is sensitive to current negative events but ignores the well-behaved histories for good worker candidates with unintentional mistakes. This can result in false-positive errors and partial reputation calculation to reduce the incentive of the worker candidates. The TSL, MSL and ATV schemes achieve the same performance when the reputation threshold is above 0.45. This reason is that the malicious and unreliable workers are easier to be detected and hence removed in the case of high EMD and attack strength. In summary, the MSL scheme can achieve a more accurate and fair reputation calculation, thereby leading to a more reliable worker selection in federated learning.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we addressed worker selection issues to ensure reliable federated learning in mobile networks. A reputation-based scheme was designed to select reliable and trusted workers. For efficient and secure reputation management, we calculated workers’ reputation by using multi-weight subjective logic model, and employed consortium blockchain to manage the reputation with tamper resistance and non-repudiation in a decentralized manner. Numerical results showed that our schemes can bring reliable federated learning to the mobile networks.
There are several possible directions that are worth being studied:
I) Due to model update validation limitation of RONI scheme in non-IID setting, more accurate and efficient validation schemes for non-IID datasets should be designed to improve the detection performance of poisoning attacks in the proposed worker selection schemes.
II) Considering the high overhead of a large number of workers will join in the federated learning, efficient schemes for optimizing the number of workers are worth investigation in order to balance the learning performance and resource cost.
III) It still remains to be an open issue on how to dynamically optimize the reputation threshold to minimize negative effects from malicious workers, e.g., by using advanced machine leaning methods.</p>
