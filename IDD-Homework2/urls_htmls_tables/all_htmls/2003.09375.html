<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, the problem of minimizing energy and time consumption for task computation and transmission is studied in a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled balloon network. In the considered network, each user needs to process a computational task in each time instant, where high-altitude balloons (HABs), acting as flying wireless base stations, can use their powerful computational abilities to process the tasks offloaded from their associated users. Since the data size of each user’s computational task varies over time, the HABs must dynamically adjust the user association, service sequence, and task partition scheme to meet the users’ needs. This problem is posed as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the energy and time consumption for task computing and transmission by adjusting the user association, service sequence, and task allocation scheme. To solve this problem, a support vector machine (SVM)-based federated learning (FL) algorithm is proposed to determine the user association proactively. The proposed SVM-based FL method enables each HAB to cooperatively build an SVM model that can determine all user associations without any transmissions of either user historical associations or computational tasks to other HABs. Given the prediction of the optimal user association, the service sequence and task allocation of each user can be optimized so as to minimize the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption. Simulations with real data of city cellular traffic from the OMNILab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption of all users by up to 16.1% compared to a conventional centralized method.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">High altitude balloons (HABs) are attracting increasing attention for future wireless communication networks, owing to their low deployment expense and large coverage range <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In particular, HABs can be used for various services including broadband Internet access, digital video/audio request, and emergency response <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To provide these services to ground users, HABs, acting as relays between ground users and base stations (BSs) as done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, must transmit computational tasks that are generated by the ground users to terrestrial BSs or the cloud via wireless backhaul links. Since the wireless resources that can be used for relaying ground user data to far-away BSs is limited, it is impractical for HABs to transmit all of their computational tasks to the BSs or the cloud. In addition, long-haul transmissions will incur significant delays <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. To reduce the task transmission delay and enable the HABs to process computational tasks locally, one can deploy mobile edge computing (MEC) locally at each HAB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In particular, MEC-enabled HABs can directly process the computational tasks offloaded from the ground users without the need to transmit them to far-away BSs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, deploying MEC at HABs also faces many challenges such as energy efficiency of processing computational tasks, user association, and computational task allocation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A number of existing works have studied important problems related to task offloading and computational resource optimization such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors studied the use of MEC-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to service ground users. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> minimized the sum transmit power of UAVs and user via jointly optimizing users’ transmit power and task allocation in an MEC network. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the authors derived the minimum number of UAVs that can cover a given space. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> studied the deployment of UAVs so as to maximize the number of service users. Compared to UAVs with limited flight time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, HABs can be tethered and equipped with powerful computing resources and, hence, they can continuously hover to serve ground users. Meanwhile, HABs can be deployed in the stratosphere to reduce the energy cost for hovering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the existing works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> do not consider scenarios in which the data size of computational tasks requested by each user changes over time. As the data size of each computational task varies, each HAB must dynamically adjust user association, service sequence, and task allocation to minimize the ground users’ energy and time consumption. For this purpose, each HAB must collect the users’ computational task information. However, each computational task processed by HABs is offloaded from a ground user and, hence, each HAB must first determine user association so as to collect the users’ computational task information and adjust service sequence as well as task allocation. In addition, each HAB can only collect the information related to the computational tasks of its associated users instead of the computational information from all users. Therefore, given only the computational task information of a subset of users, each HAB must use traditional iterative or distributed optimization methods, such as Lagrangian dual decomposition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> or game theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, to find the globally optimal user association, thus resulting in additional overhead and delay for computational task processing. Moreover, if such known techniques are used, as the data size of each computational task varies, the HABs must rerun their iterative or distribution optimization algorithm to cope with this change thus increasing the time needed to minimize the energy and time consumption of ground users. To tackle this challenge, each HAB needs to predict the user association based on the historical information of the computational tasks. One promising solution is to use machine learning algorithms for the prediction of optimal user association. In particular, ML algorithms can train a learning model to find a relationship between the future optimal user association and the computational task that each user is currently executing. Based on the predicted optimal user association, the HABs can optimize service sequence and task allocation hence minimizing the energy and time consumption of each user.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, a number of existing works such as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> used machine learning algorithms to solve resource optimization problems related to MEC. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> developed a deep learning method to optimize the user association scheme. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors sought to minimize the task processing delay using deep reinforcement learning. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> developed a cache and communication resource allocation scheme using a deep recurrent neural network. However, most of these works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> use centralized learning algorithms. Hence, each distributed node needs to transmit its local dataset such as its historical association scheme and the data size of the requested task to a central controller for training a machine learning model. However, it is impractical to send all local datasets to a central controller in MEC-enabled HAB networks since the transmission of local datasets can lead to significant energy consumption. To address this challenge, one can use federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> that enables distributed devices to collaboratively train a machine learning model via sharing trained parameters with other devices instead of massive dataset. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the problem of joint transmission power and resource allocation is solved by FL to reduce the queuing delay of all users. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> introduced an energy-efficient strategy for transmission and computation resource allocation under delay constraints. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an FL algorithm to optimize resource allocation scheme in mobile edge computing. However, the existing works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> that directly averaged the learning models generated by HABs in the FL training process did not optimize the parameters that are needed to capture the relationship between different learning models of different users, thus degrading the FL performance. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel FL algorithm that can capture the relationships among HABs’ user association schemes and can be implemented over HABs.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.5" class="ltx_p">In the considered scenario, all the communication links will use the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to provide high data rate services for ground users so as to satisfy the delay requirement of computational tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. A time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is adopted to support directional transmissions over the mmWave band. Note that, the channel gains of the mmWave links depend on the instantaneous large scale and small scale fading. For HAB-ground user transmission links (air-to-ground transmission links), the large scale fading is the free space path loss and attenuation due to rain and clouds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Small scale fading is modeled as Ricean fading due to the presence of line-of-sight rays from the HAB to most of the locations in the HAB service area <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.

As the data size of the requested computational task varies, the HABs must dynamically adjust the user association, service sequence, and task allocation to minimize each user’s energy and time consumption. The problem in (<a href="#S2.E13" title="In II-E Problem Formulation ‣ II System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning for Task and Resource Allocation in Wireless High Altitude Balloon Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>) is challenging to solve by conventional optimization algorithms due to the following reasons. First, each HAB must collect the information related to the computational task requested by each user so as to minimize the energy and time consumption of ground users. However, each computational task is generated by a ground user and, hence, each HAB can only collect the information related to the computational tasks of its associated users instead of all users’ computational information. When using optimization techniques, given the computational task information of only a fraction of the users, each HAB must use traditional iterative methods to find the globally optimal user association thus increasing the delay for processing computational task. Second, as the data size of each computational task varies, the HABs must re-execute the iterative methods which leads to additional delays and overhead. Thus, we need a machine learning approach that can predict the optimal user association via using the information collected by each HAB itself. Based on the predicted optimal user association, each HAB can collect the data size of the computational task from its associated users thus optimizing service sequence and task allocation for the users. User association can be considered as a multi-classification problem and SVM methods are good at solving such problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Hence, we propose an SVM-based machine learning approach for predicting user association. In addition, exchanging the information related to historical computational task request among HABs can lead to significant energy consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Thus, we propose an SVM-based FL algorithm to determine the user association proactively so as to minimize the energy and time consumption. The proposed algorithm enables each HAB to use its local dataset to collaboratively train an optimal SVM model that can determine user association for all users while keeping the training data local. Based on the proactive user association, the optimization problem in (<a href="#S2.E13" title="In II-E Problem Formulation ‣ II System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning for Task and Resource Allocation in Wireless High Altitude Balloon Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>) can be simplified and solved.</p>

Then, each HAB exchanges the trained SVM model with other HABs to integrate the trained SVM models and improve the SVM model locally so as to collaboratively perform a prediction for each user without training data exchange.</p>

The values of other parameters are defined in Table I. All statistical results are averaged over 5,000 independent runs. Real data used to train the proposed algorithm is obtained from the OMNILab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. We consider the data size of cellular traffic in the dataset as the data size of each user’s computational task. The optimal user associations used for training the SVM model to minimize the utility function of all users are obtained by exhaustive search. In simulations, we propose two baseline algorithms named SVM-based local learning and SVM-based global learning, respectively. The SVM-based local learning enables each HAB to train its local SVM model individually while the SVM-based global learning requires each HAB to transmit its local dataset to other HABs for training purpose.</p>

In this figure, the accuracy rate is the probability with which the considered algorithms accurately predict the optimal user association.

Clearly, as the number of users increases, the accuracy rate of the proposed algorithm increases. This is due to the fact that, as the number of users increases, the average energy that is used to process the computational tasks of each user decreases and hence, the probability that each user changes its association increases. In consequence, the information of computational task from each user can be collected by different HABs, thus increasing the correlation between the datasets at the HABs. Hence, the accuracy rate of the proposed algorithm increases.

Although exchanging the trained parameters increases the number of iterations needed to converge, the proposed algorithm can achieve a performance gain of up to 19.4% gain in terms of prediction performance compared to SVM-based local learning.</p>

From Fig. <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Federated Learning for Task and Resource Allocation in Wireless High Altitude Balloon Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we can see that the value of utility function increases as the number of users increases. This stems from the fact that, as the number of users increases, the number of tasks that users need to process increases, which increases the sum energy and time consumption for task processing.

This is because that the sum energy consumption is linear related to the number of users in the considered TDMA system while the sum of the access delay is exponential related to the number of users. From Fig. <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Federated Learning for Task and Resource Allocation in Wireless High Altitude Balloon Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we can also see that the proposed algorithm reduces the value of utility function by up to 16.1% and 26.7% compared to the SVM-based global learning and SVM-based local learning. This gain stems from the fact that the proposed algorithm enables each HAB to build the SVM model cooperatively without transmitting the local training data samples to the HAB hence reducing energy consumption for local data transmission while guarantee a better performance for prediction of optimal user association.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied the problem of minimizing energy and time consumption for task computation and transmission. We have formulated this problem as an optimization problem that seeks to minimize the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption of all users. To solve this problem, we have developed an SVM-based FL algorithm which enables each HAB to cooperatively train an optimal SVM model using its own data. The SVM model can analyze the relationship between the future user association and the data size of the task that each user needs to process at current time slot so as to determine the user association proactively. Based on the optimal prediction, the optimization of service sequence and task allocation are determined so as to minimize the energy and time consumption for task computing and transmission. Simulation results have shown that the proposed approach yields significant gains in terms of sum energy and time consumption compared to conventional approaches.</p>
