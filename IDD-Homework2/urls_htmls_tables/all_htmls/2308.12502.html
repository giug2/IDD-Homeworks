<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To protect users’ <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">right to be forgotten</em> in federated learning, federated unlearning aims at eliminating the impact of leaving users’ data on the global learned model.
The current research in federated unlearning mainly concentrated on developing effective and efficient unlearning techniques. However, the issue of incentivizing valuable users to remain engaged and preventing their data from being unlearned is still under-explored, yet important to the unlearned model performance.
This paper focuses on the incentive issue and develops an incentive mechanism for federated learning and unlearning. We first characterize the leaving users’ impact on the global model accuracy and the required communication rounds for unlearning.
Building on these results, we propose a four-stage game to capture the interaction and information updates during the learning and unlearning process. A key contribution is to summarize users’ multi-dimensional private information into one-dimensional metrics to guide the incentive design.
We further investigate whether allowing federated
unlearning is beneficial to the server and users, compared to a scenario without unlearning. Interestingly,
users usually have a larger total payoff in the scenario with higher costs, due to the server’s excess incentives
under information asymmetry.
The numerical results demonstrate the necessity of unlearning incentives for retaining valuable leaving users, and also show that our proposed mechanisms decrease the server’s cost by up to 53.91% compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a promising distributed machine learning paradigm, in which multiple users collaborate to train a shared model under the coordination of a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This approach allows users to keep their local data on their own devices and only share the intermediate model parameters, which helps protect their raw data. However, despite these measures, it may not provide sufficient privacy guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For privacy reasons, one desirable property of a federated learning platform is the users’ “right to be forgotten” (RTBF), which has been explicitly stated in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
That is, a user has the right to request deletion of his private data and its impact on the trained model, if he no longer desires to participate in the platform.
Users may seek to leave a platform for a variety of reasons. For example, they may feel that the benefits from the platform are not sufficient to compensate for their potential privacy leakage from participation. Furthermore, until they participate in the platform, they may not have full knowledge of these benefits and costs due to incomplete information about other
users’ data. For instance, users’ privacy costs in federated learning depend on how unique their data is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which they can infer from their training loss after training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To remove data from a trained federated learning model, the concept of <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated unlearning</em> has recently been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In this concept, after some users request to revoke their data, staying users will perform additional training or calculations to eliminate the impact of leaving users’ data and obtain an unlearned model. A simple yet costly approach is to retrain the model from scratch with the requested data being removed from the training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. To be more efficient and effective, existing literature (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>) focused on alternative federated unlearning methods that obtain a model similar (in some distance metrics) to a retrained model with lower computational costs.
However, these studies usually assumed that users are willing to participate in federated learning and unlearning. This assumption may not be realistic without proper incentives since users incur various costs during the training process (e.g., time, energy, and privacy costs). Our goal in this paper is to develop incentive mechanisms to help retain valuable leaving users and create a sustainable learning platform for both the users and the server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To design the incentive mechanism for federated learning and unlearning, there are several challenges to tackle.
First, different leaving users will lead to different unlearned model performances and unlearning costs, the relationship among which is still an open problem yet essential for designing incentives.
Second, it is difficult for the server to design incentives for a large number of heterogeneous users, when users have multi-dimensional private information (e.g., training costs and privacy costs) and unknown information (e.g., users’ training losses before federated learning).
Third, unlearning incentives for retaining valuable leaving users require careful design. High incentives may encourage strategic users to intentionally request revocation to obtain retention rewards, while low incentives may fail to retain valuable users. It is also crucial for the server to distinguish between high-quality leaving users (e.g., with rare and valuable data) and low-quality ones (e.g., with erroneous data), both of which can lead to high training losses.
Fourth, both learning and unlearning incentives affect the server’s and users’ payoffs but are determined in different stages - before or after federated learning. Meanwhile, there are different information asymmetry levels in each stage, as the federated learning process can reveal some information such as users’ training losses and contributions. Thus, the mutual influence of the incentives and dynamic information asymmetry further complicate the incentive mechanism design.

Due to the complex interaction, users’ multi-dimensional private information, and dynamically updated knowledge, the server’s optimization problem in Stage I of the four-stage game is highly complex. We summarize users’ multi-dimensional heterogeneity into several one-dimensional metrics and develop an efficient algorithm with linear complexity, to handle the exponentially large number of possible cases involved in optimal mechanism design.
We also identify and analyze a supermodular game among the users to obtain their optimal data revocation decisions.

We show that high costs and training losses motivate users to leave, while the server will retain the leaving users who make significant contributions to model accuracy but not necessarily low training losses, as small losses of retained users will reduce privacy costs yet increase unlearning costs.

<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of <em id="S1.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">machine unlearning</em>, which refers to the process of removing the impact of a data sample from a trained model, was first introduced by Cao et al. in 2015 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Most related literature was about centralized machine unlearning (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>), in which the unlearned model (not retrained from scratch) was trained on summarized (e.g., aggregates of summations) or partitioned subsets rather than individual training samples. As a result, the model only needed to be updated on the subset(s) of data that are associated with the requested samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Centralized unlearning methods are not suited to federated learning, due to (i) lack of direct data access, (ii) the fact that the global
model is updated based on the aggregated rather than the raw gradients, and (iii) the possibility that different users may have similar training samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. This motivated the emergence of <em id="S1.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated unlearning</em>, which focuses on deleting the impact of revoked data in federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Only a few studies proposed federated unlearning mechanisms using methods such as gradient subtraction (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>), gradient scaling (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>), or knowledge distillation (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>). Albeit with good numerical performance, there is no theoretical guarantee of these proposed federated unlearning methods. To fill this gap, we propose theoretical bounds on the model optimality gap and communication rounds for one approach to federated unlearning in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, there is a wide spectrum of literature on incentive mechanisms for various systems, including crowdsensing (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>), wireless networks (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>), data trading (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>), and energy sharing (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>).
Some important work studied incentive mechanism design for federated learning to discourage valuable clients from leaving (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>). However, very few of them considered users’ multi-dimensional private information (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>), and none of them incorporated the unique aspects of federated unlearning (e.g., unlearning costs) or the dynamics of users’
payoffs (e.g., pre-/post-training and before/after some users leave). This paper is the first to focus on incentive mechanism design for both federated learning and unlearning.</p>

Then, we derive bounds on global model accuracy and federated unlearning time in Section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3 Model Accuracy and Unlearning Time ‣ 2 Characterization of Federated Learning and Unlearning Models ‣ Incentivized Federated Learning and Unlearning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>.</p>

However, some users may later choose to revoke their data and leave the system. In response, the server can provide further incentives to retain valuable users. Upon the final exit of some users from the system, the remaining users collectively execute an algorithm to unlearn the leaving users’ data.</p>

Basically, Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In 4.2 Users’ Revocation Decisions in Stage III ‣ 4 Optimal Incentive Mechanism in Unlearning-Allowed Scenario ‣ Incentivized Federated Learning and Unlearning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> corresponds to doing best response updates of the users starting from all users choosing not to revoke (i.e., 0). It is well known that for supermodular games, these updates will converge monotonically to a NE.

First, users’ multi-dimensional heterogeneity leads to a challenging multi-dimensional contract design for the server. We will simplify the analysis by summarizing users’ multi-dimensional heterogeneity into several one-dimensional metrics, to guide the server’s design of the optimal rewards and data sizes in the contract.
Second, as the total number of IR and IC constraints is large (i.e., <math id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="J^{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">J</mi><mn id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐽</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p4.1.m1.1c">J^{2}</annotation></semantics></math>), it is challenging to obtain the optimal contract directly.

Users with smaller federated Shapley values are more likely to be retained by the server, as smaller Shapley values represent larger contributions to the global model accuracy.
Users with smaller training losses have lower privacy costs and may require fewer incentives from the server, compared to users with larger losses. However, Fig. <a href="#S6.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ 6.2.1 Users’ Expected Payoffs and Server’s Expected Cost Comparison ‣ 6.2 Experiment Results ‣ 6 Simulations ‣ Incentivized Federated Learning and Unlearning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a> shows that the server does not necessarily retain users with smaller training losses. This is because given a fixed set of users, reducing the total training losses of retained users means increasing the total losses of leaving users, resulting in higher unlearning costs (Proposition <a href="#Thmproposition3" title="Proposition 3. ‣ 4.1 Server’s Retention Strategies in Stage IV ‣ 4 Optimal Incentive Mechanism in Unlearning-Allowed Scenario ‣ Incentivized Federated Learning and Unlearning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).</p>

Our proposed RAR reduces the server’s cost by around 53.91% (black dotted line) compared with LLA.
The reduced cost of RAR compared with NRI can reach 11.59% (black dashed line) and will increase in the number of users, as the server retains more valuable users when the number of users increases.
Therefore, it is beneficial for the server to retain valuable leaving users and make joint optimization of federated learning and unlearning incentive mechanisms.
As the objective of our incentive mechanism design is to minimize the server’s cost, the server’s cost reduction is at the expense of users’ payoffs (as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ 6.2.1 Users’ Expected Payoffs and Server’s Expected Cost Comparison ‣ 6.2 Experiment Results ‣ 6 Simulations ‣ Incentivized Federated Learning and Unlearning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study to focus on the important issue of incentive design for federated learning and unlearning.
We derive theoretical bounds on the global model optimality gap and the number of communication rounds of natural federated unlearning, based on Scaffold and FedAvg algorithms.
Our approach tackles a challenging problem in incentive design, by summarizing users’ multi-dimensional heterogeneity into one-dimensional metrics and developing an efficient algorithm for an exponentially large number of possible cases.
We compare the unlearning-forbidden and unlearning-allowed scenarios in terms of users’ payoffs and the server’s cost. Counter-intuitively, users usually prefer the scenario where they have larger costs. This is because the server will give them even higher incentives than their costs due to information asymmetry.
We also identify what types of users will leave the system or be retained by the server.
The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed incentive mechanism and the benefits of unlearning incentives for retaining leaving users.
We will design incentive mechanisms for federated unlearning to maximize social welfare in future work.
