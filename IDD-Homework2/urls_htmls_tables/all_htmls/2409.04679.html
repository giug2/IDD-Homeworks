<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Due to saturated regions of inputting low dynamic range (LDR) images and large intensity changes among the LDR images caused by different exposures, it is challenging to produce an information enriched panoramic LDR image without visual artifacts for a high dynamic range (HDR) scene through stitching multiple geometrically synchronized LDR images with different exposures and pairwise overlapping fields of views (OFOVs). Fortunately, the stitching of such images is innately a perfect scenario for the fusion of a physics-driven approach and a data-driven approach due to their OFOVs. Based on this new insight, a novel neural augmentation based panoramic HDR stitching algorithm is proposed in this paper. The physics-driven approach is built up using the OFOVs. Different exposed images of each view are initially generated by using the physics-driven approach, are then refined by a data-driven approach, and are finally used to produce panoramic LDR images with different exposures. All the panoramic LDR images with different exposures are combined together via a multi-scale exposure fusion algorithm to produce the final panoramic LDR image. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms existing panoramic stitching algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Panoramic stitching can compose a group of images with pairwise overlapping fields of views (OFOVs) from a real-world scene to synthesize an image with a wider view for the scene <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. All these images are usually 8-bit sRGB images and their exposure times are almost the same. Such a capturing method performs well for those real-word low dynamic range (LDR) scenes. However, a real-world high dynamic range (HDR) scene could have a dynamic range of 100,000,000:1 whereas an 8-bit sRGB image only has a dynamic range of 256:1 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Our human eyes are able to perceive dynamic ranges by up to 1,000,000:1. There are underexposed and/or overexposed regions in panoramic LDR images which are synthesized via the existing panoramic LDR stitching. Therefore, the inputting images of panoramic stitching are highly demanded to be captured by using different exposures for those real-world HDR scenes to give users a higher quality of experience <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The resultant panoramic stitching is a new type, and can be called panoramic HDR stitching.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Two main steps of panoramic HDR stitching are: 1) to geometrically register all the inputting images by extending those algorithms in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and 2) to stitch all the aligned images together photometrically to removal all possible visual artifacts and recover underexposed and overexposed information. This paper primarily concentrates on the latter, which presents a new problem which has three main challenges: 1) eliminate brightness discrepancies among all the aligned images in the OFOVs caused by the varying exposures; 2) restore lost information in saturated regions of all the aligned images due to very limited number of different exposures, especially in those non-OFOV regions with only one exposure; and 3) preserve fine details of the darkest and brightest areas well in the final panoramic LDR image. These challenges cannot be adequately solved via existing panoramic LDR stitching algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For instance, if all the synchronized images are tuned according to the brightness of the image with the largest (smallest) exposure, the brightest (darkest) areas of the HDR scene are then become overexposed (underexposed) in the panoramic LDR image, as illustrated in Figs. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Neural Augmentation Based Panoramic High Dynamic Range Stitching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(c) and <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Neural Augmentation Based Panoramic High Dynamic Range Stitching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(d). Therefore, there is a need to introduce a different panoramic stitching algorithm tailored for real-world HDR scenes.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On top of our conference paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a new type of panoramic stitching algorithm is proposed in this paper for a set of geometrically aligned LDR images with differing exposures and OFOVs, aimed at creating a panoramic LDR image with enriched information in the darkest and brightest regions for an HDR scene. The proposed panoramic HDR stitching algorithm is built upon a distinctive characteristic of the geometrically aligned LDR images with OFOVs and different exposures: all the pixels in the non-OFOV regions have only one exposure, whereas all the pixels in the OFOVs have two different exposures. Multiple panoramic LDR images with different exposures are generated from the inputs by using a novel physics-driven deep learning framework called neural augmentation. The framework is a seamless integration of a physics-driven approach and a data-driven approach . The former is on top of intensity mapping functions (IMFs) and the latter is on top of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed framework effectively combines both the generalization capability of the former and the learning capability of the latter.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The IMFs are estimated for adjacent images using the OFOVs among them, rather than being computed from camera response functions (CRFs) as in previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In other words, the proposed neural augmentation does not assume the availability of CRFs as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the stitching of these images is a good case for the combination of the physics-driven approach and data-driven approach due to the OFOVs. The IMFs are estimated by using a new algorithm named as weighted histogram averaging (WHA) in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> which is based on a novel correspondence between the two images at histogram-bin-level: each histogram bin from one image matches to one unique segment of the histogram bins from the other image. The mapped value is computed by averaging intensities in the matched segment with properly defined weights. The WHA outperforms those methods in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. The IMFs are adopted to initially produce the panoramic LDR images with different exposures. Such a method is a typical physics-driven approach and experimental results indicate that the accuracy of IMFs plays an important role in our neural augmentation. The OFOVs are thus required to be sufficiently large so as to estimate the accurate IMFs. The physics-driven approach is independent of training data, and it usually increases the robustness of our neural augmentation framework if it is accurate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Even though the physics-driven approach is independent of training data, differently exposed images of each view generated by the physics-driven approach should be enhanced because of the limited representation capability of the physics-driven approach. A data-driven approach is thus introduced to refine these images by learning the remaining (or residual) information by proposing a new multi-scale exposedness aware network (MEAN). Our MEAN is designed by incorporating an exposedness aware guidance branch (EAGB) into short-skip connection based recursive residual groups (SRRGs). As pointed out in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, deep CNNs generally have limited capability to represent high-frequency information. The function of both the multi-scale feature refinement structure and the short-skip connection structure is to preserve the desired high-frequency information. The exposedness of the input images is utilized to define a set of binary masks. The EAGB is designed on top of the binary masks, and it can assistant the proposed MEAN restore the overexposed and underexposed regions more efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">All the differently exposed images of all the views are used to construct panoramic LDR images with different exposures. The generated panoramic LDR images with different exposures are ultimately combined together via the multi-scale exposure fusion (MEF) algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, together with a physics-driven approach for the enhancement of high-frequency information. This process results in a panoramic LDR image with enriched information. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Neural Augmentation Based Panoramic High Dynamic Range Stitching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b), information in the darkest and brightest regions is preserved better in the stitched image by the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm is different from the algorithms in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> in the sense that a panoramic HDR image is first generated and then being tone mapped to a panoramic LDR image for displaying by the algorithms in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.

Therefore, our new IMF estimation algorithm is named as the WHA. Unlike the pixel-level correspondence in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the correspondence at the histogram-bin-level is robust to moving objects and camera movements. On the other hand, the high-frequency information will be lost when the IMFs are used to synthesize images.</p>

The key components of the proposed MEAN are EAGB, SRRGs, and multi-scale feature refinement. The SRRG is designed by adding short-skip connections to the RRG in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> in order to pass shallow layers’ information into deep layers. As such, the high-frequency information has a potential to be well preserved. The proposed SRRG can propagate more informative features among different layers.

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed WHA can be applied to investigate ghost removal of differently exposed LDR images. There are many ghost removal algorithms for differently exposed images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. The proposed WHA is adopted to improve the ghost removal algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. One of the input images is selected as the reference image. Pixels in all other images are divided into inconsistent and consistent pixels. All the inconsistent pixels are corrected by using the correlation between the reference image and the corresponding image. The IMFs which are estimated by the CHM in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> are used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to detect all the inconsistent pixels and correct them. The CHM in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> is replaced by the proposed WHA. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-A Evaluation of the Proposed WHA ‣ V Experiment Results ‣ Neural Augmentation Based Panoramic High Dynamic Range Stitching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(b), there is serious color distortion in the wall by using the CHM in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Fortunately, the color distortion is significantly reduced by our WHA. It should be pointed out that the WHA was recently applied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> to design an optical flow estimation algorithm for differently exposed LDR images in LDR domain. It was shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> that the WHA outperforms the gamma correction which was widely utilized by deep-learning based ghost removal algorithms.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S5.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A new panoramic stitching system is proposed in this subsection. Instead of capturing a series of images by existing panoramic stitching systems, multiple differently exposed images are captured with varying orientations. For simplicity, the case of two differently exposed images is studied in this subsection. The new system can be easily extended to the case of three different exposed images. The differences between the orientations of these two images are about 15 degrees as shown in Fig. 14. Since the exposures of the two images are different, the algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> cannot be applied to align these images directly. The right images is first mapped to the brightness of the left one by using the IMFs between them. They are then aligned by simultaneously using homography transformations and thin-plate spline transformations. The homography transformation provides a global linear transformation, while the thin-plate spline transformation allows local nonlinear deformation. These two images are finally stitched by using the proposed neural augmentation based algorithm. Two panoramic LDR images with different exposures are produced by using the same set of homography transformation and thin-plate spline transformations. They are fused to generate the final image as shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-D Comparison of Different Panoramic Stitching Algorithms ‣ V Experiment Results ‣ Neural Augmentation Based Panoramic High Dynamic Range Stitching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> (d).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Such a new panoramic HDR stitching system is compared with two conventional panoramic LDR stitching systems. One is from a smart phone and the other is the algorithm in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The exposure times of those images are supposed to be almost the same for the conventional panoramic LDR stitching systems. As demonstrated in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-D Comparison of Different Panoramic Stitching Algorithms ‣ V Experiment Results ‣ Neural Augmentation Based Panoramic High Dynamic Range Stitching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, the images produced by the new panoramic HDR stitching system is much better than those generated by the conventional panoramic LDR stitching systems. The panoramic LDR image captured with a mobile phone exhibits noticeable distortion in the bridge deck, as highlighted by these two red boxes. The panoramic LDR image generated using <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> includes visible seams, and has three different brightnesses in different regions. These artifacts are removed by using the proposed panoramic HDR stitching algorithm.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">High dynamic range imaging and panoramic stitching are two popular types of computational photography. They are studied jointly in this paper while they are usually investigated independently. There are many applications of high dynamic range (HDR) panoramic imaging. A novel algorithm is proposed in this paper to stitch multiple geometrically synchronized and differently exposed sRGB images with overlapping fields of views (OFOVs) for a real-world high dynamic range (HDR) scene. Different exposed images of each view are initially generated by using an accurate physics-driven approach, are then refined by a data-driven approach, and are finally adopted to generate panoramic LDR images with different exposures. All the panoramic LDR images with different exposures are merged using a multi-scale exposure fusion algorithm, incorporating a physics-driven approach for the enhancement of high-frequency information, resulting in an information-enriched panoramic LDR image.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It should be pointed out that the inputs are required to have sufficiently large overlapping fields of views large OFOVs by the proposed neural augmentation. It would be interesting to consider the case that the OFOVs are not large. This challenging case will be investigated by exploring new ways to derive the highly accurate physics-driven approach required by the neural augmentation.</p>
