<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id9.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Visual Question Answering (VQA) attracts much attention from both industry and academia.
As a multi-modality task, it is challenging since it requires not only visual and textual understanding, but also the ability to align cross-modality representations.
Previous approaches extensively employ entity-level alignments, such as the correlations between the visual regions and their semantic labels, or the interactions across question words and object features.
These attempts aim to improve the cross-modality representations, while ignoring their internal relations.
Instead, we propose to apply structured alignments, which work with graph representation of visual and textual content, aiming to capture the deep connections between the visual and textual modalities.
Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to represent and integrate graphs for structured alignments.
In this work, we attempt to solve this issue by first converting different modality entities into sequential nodes and the adjacency graph, then incorporating them for structured alignments.
As demonstrated in our experimental results, such a structured alignment improves reasoning performance.
In addition, our model also exhibits better interpretability for each generated answer.
The proposed model, without any pretraining, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on GQA dataset, and beats the non-pretrained state-of-the-art methods on VQA-v2 dataset.</span></p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, Visual Question Answering (VQA) has received much attention in both industry and academia.
This can be partially attributed to its broad applications (<em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, early educational systems).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Even deep learning models achieve increasingly better performance across many computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their performance may still be inadequate for applications with diversified testing scenarios.
This also happens in VQA.
It is already challenging for models to understand the concepts in visual or textual content individually.
Moreover, this task further requires cross-modality understanding.
To achieve competitive performance in VQA, machine learning models need to represent and align different entities in both visual and textual content.
Entity-level alignments are insufficient for VQA, since the task usually requires the model to detect the deep connections between these two modalities.
We argue structured alignments are necessary for deep cross-modality understanding.
However, this requires a graph representation of visual and textual content.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, in the CV domain, such a graph is defined as the scene graph, a structured graphical representation of the image.
Each scene graph encodes high-level visual concepts, including objects, attributes, and relations, as nodes and edges.
This type of structured representation has led to many state-of-the-art models in image captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, image retrieval <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, relationship modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, and image generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
In addition, it promotes the publishing of several datasets containing well-annotated scene graphs, such as GQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and Visual Genome <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, to facilitate research on the use of scene graphs for visual and textual content understanding.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ SA-VQA: Structured Alignment of Visual and Semantic Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the pair of an image and its corresponding scene graph.
Given the constructed graph, it is straightforward for a human to infer that the answer to the presented question is “yes”. However, to allow VQA methods to leverage the information from scene graphs for reasoning, a challenging problem must be addressed:
“<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Is there any way to embed structured graph information into the learning and reasoning process of VQA models?</span>”
More specifically, the problem can be formulated as how to align features from the structured scene graphs, visual content, and questions, and how to reason the answer from them.
Taking Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ SA-VQA: Structured Alignment of Visual and Semantic Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> as an example, when the objects and relations in the scene graph are well aligned with the question, it is straightforward for the model to infer the answer.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In previous studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, fully connected scene graphs or conditional relational graphs were constructed from either visual concepts or questions.
Such structured representation is further processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which usually apply message passing for graph modeling.
However, GNNs are inefficient in terms of updating the node hidden states, and the edges are also tricky to model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.
In addition, the results lack interpretability when only features are embedded and passed to neighbors.
Nevertheless, these do not imply that the GNNs will be replaced in all graph-based tasks.
Instead, many ongoing studies on GNNs are conducted to overcome their limitations and achieve better performance.
One direction is to combine GNNs and Transformers to model both local and global interactions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we leverage Transformer to tackle this problem in a unified framework.
The attention module in Transformer allows us to disclose correlations between input tokens, which is critical for modality alignment and understanding. Thus, it has been widely employed for cross vision and language tasks. The conventional attention modules learned correlations between different input tokens fully from data.
These modules can attain meaningful outcomes when the task requires less reasoning and large-scale training data is presented.
However, the learning can be extremely slow for tasks that demand intensive reasoning, and building the large-scale training dataset can also be challenging.
Instead, we propose to use graph-structured information to guide learning. With the help of structured information, it is possible to learn the deep alignments between visual and textual representation, even when presented with limited training data.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of embedding graph information for visual question answering. Our main contributions are as follows:

Objects’ labels, attributes, and relations are detected from the image, represented by the yellow, orange, and gray nodes, respectively. They form the semantic graph based on their connectivity.
The visual graph and question graph are built in a similar way.
These three graphs are then converted into input sequences together with their corresponding adjacency matrices.
The three sequences are inputs to two Transformers (Trms), where the adjacency matrices act as structured information to the Transformers.
The outputs of the two Transformers are then used to predict the final answer.</span></figcaption>

First, objects are detected, along with the object labels, object attributes, and their relations.
Next, three different graphs, <em id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, semantic graph, visual graph, and question graph, are constructed.

We believe semantic and visual graphs are complementary to each other. The semantic graph expedites the integration of structured features, and the visual graph offers supplementary information, which may be misplaced in the semantic graph.
The question graph further allows the inference to pay extra attention to the hints embedded in the question.
They will be inputs to the visual and semantic streams, which employ Transformers to highlight the correlations between the question and the corresponding image.
Finally, the outputs of the two Transformers are used to predict the answer with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Scene graph generation has been a very challenging research task.
This task itself is beyond the scope of this work.
We employ an off-the-shelf object and attribute model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to discover the nodes and edges that are utilized to construct the semantic graph.
More details will be discussed in our experiment settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, inaccurate objects and attributes will result in poor semantic graphs, which may mislead the learning of our model.
To reduce the impact of poor semantic graphs, we use all the top-K prediction results for each candidate bounding box, regarded as a <span id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SuperNode</span>.
SuperNode covers redundant object nodes, and the recall of objects is much higher as well.
This is necessary, as the goal of VQA model is to infer the answers from relevant features.
If a relevant object node is absent from the semantic graph, learning from an incomplete graph would be more challenging.
Indeed, even human beings may be incapable of recovering the answer when solely presented with an incomplete semantic graph.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">However, each SuperNode also introduces noisy and irrelevant information.
Extra mechanisms are demanded to select the most relevant information related to the given question.
A tentative solution is to learn to assign different weights for each object in the SuperNode.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Transformer architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> consists of the encoder and the decoder, both of which apply multi-head attention module for alignment learning.
In both the encoder and decoder, scaled dot-product attention (Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Attention learning for structured alignment ‣ 5 Structured representation integration ‣ SA-VQA: Structured Alignment of Visual and Semantic Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) is utilized to compute the output from the given query and key-value pairs.
The attention mechanism can discover the connections embedded in the input tokens.
It demonstrates its success across a wide range of NLP and multi-modality alignment tasks.
However, it usually requires a large amount of training data for the model to converge and achieve decent performance.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Instead, our goal is to reduce the dependency on large-scale training data.
We attempt to assist the learning of attention modules by incorporating structured graph features.
We believe that the external graph features, even incomplete and inaccurate, can still scale down the searching space of the attention module.
Therefore, it is capable of learning feature relations even presented with limited training data.</p>

Unlike sequence-to-sequence learning tasks, our model regards VQA task as a classification problem, and uses Fully-Connected Layers (FCs) to process Transformer outputs.
We compute cross-entropy loss from the visual and semantic streams individually.
We also use both early fusion and late fusion strategies to fuse two types of features for classification.
Overall, our training loss is defined as follows:</p>

Differently, the GQA dataset attempts to collect more complicated and compositional questions, which require more reasoning over the visual concepts.
It consists of 22M novel and diverse questions and 113k images.
Its questions display a richer vocabulary and more various linguistic and grammatical structures than other VQA datasets.
Moreover, it contains clean, unified, rich, and unambiguous scene graphs (including bounding box information, attributes, and relations) for 85k+ images (training and validation splits only), which are normalized and extended from the Visual Genome <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> dataset.
We evaluated our model on the testing split of the GQA dataset, which is believed to be more challenging and can demonstrate each model’s reasoning ability.
In addition, we test our model’s performance on different qualities of scene graph (we manually add different levels of noises) using the validation split to study the impact of semantic graph quality.</p>

Besides, to reduce the computational load, we merge identical relation and attribute nodes in the semantic graph, and re-build the adjacency matrix accordingly.
But we do not combine object category nodes. Different same-category nodes match with different identities, which may be critical for question answering, such as counting the number of a particular object.

The column “PT” indicates whether the method uses external datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> for pretraining or not.
We compare our method with previous approaches on both the GQA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and VQA-v2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> datasets.
It shows that, on GQA dataset, our SA-VQA model gains improvement over the state-of-the-art methods and displays better performance than even the pre-trained models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.
In particular, our approach demonstrates much better accuracy than NSM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> on the more challenging <span id="S6.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Open</span> question category.
Meanwhile, on the VQA-v2 dataset, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that do not use extra data for pre-training, and achieve competitive results with the other approaches that employ the pre-training step.</p>

<p id="S6.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since SA-VQA uses two transformers to produce the answers, we also employ two transformers in Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 (see Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 6.4 Ablation study ‣ 6 Experimental setup and results ‣ SA-VQA: Structured Alignment of Visual and Semantic Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> to make a fair comparison.
The two transformers are initialized with different parameters. Again, we utilize late fusion to obtain the final prediction results.
Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 6.4 Ablation study ‣ 6 Experimental setup and results ‣ SA-VQA: Structured Alignment of Visual and Semantic Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> are their results.
Compared with the proposed SA-VQA, which uses semantic and visual graphs simultaneously, their performance drops significantly.
This suggests that the semantic or visual branch alone is inadequate for the transformer to infer the correct answers. Especially, as discussed earlier, the semantic graph may be noisy and incomplete, while the visual graph is complete but redundant. Both graphs complement each other and lead to better performance.
Also, the visual Transformer alone exhibits better performance than the semantic Transformer with the semantic scene graph.
This may be due to the noises from the scene graph, which can introduce incorrect bounding box labels and attributes. This eventually may mislead the model.
Exp. 5 is designed to test whether fusion is necessary.
More specifically, we only adopt the last loss term in Eq. (<a href="#S5.E4" title="Equation 4 ‣ 5.4 Output representation ‣ 5 Structured representation integration ‣ SA-VQA: Structured Alignment of Visual and Semantic Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) when training the model. The other two loss terms are removed.
The result shows that adding the loss term to each transformer’s output is necessary. Otherwise, the model may have much worse performance.</p>

In Exp. 6, only the top-1 bounding box label is used in the semantic graph, while in Exp. 7 and SA-VQA (Exp. 8), the top-5 bounding-box labels are used.
Exp. 7 and 8 use different approaches to integrate the top-5 features.
Exp. 7 averages the features, which may involve the irrelevant information per bounding box, while Exp. 8 weights the feature by the pre-trained SNS model to eliminate the influence from irrelevant information in top-5 candidates.
From Exp. 6 and 7, we can also observe that even with extra irrelevant information, better performance is still achieved when using the top-5 semantic candidates than with the top-1 model.
This suggests that the graph helps the attention model to discover the related information to the question, which eventually benefits the answer generation.
Also, from Exp. 7 and 8, we can see that the weighted top-K features contribute more to the overall performance than evenly weighted features.</p>

This SNS model is used in our SA-VQA model. To test whether a better SNS model can lead to a better overall GQA model, we manually modify the SNS outputs to obtain different levels of prediction accuracy by replacing the ground truth label with a random incorrect label.
Then, we train different SA-VQA models using the modified SNS outputs.
We randomly divided the validation split into two halves, one for validation and the other for testing.
The results (Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 6.4.1 Single stream of features from images ‣ 6.4 Ablation study ‣ 6 Experimental setup and results ‣ SA-VQA: Structured Alignment of Visual and Semantic Representations for Visual Question Answering" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) show that SNS model’s performance positively correlates with SA-VQA’s performance.
This result is expected, since achieving a better SNS model is equivalent to obtaining better structured representation from the graph.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present a novel model named SA-VQA.
In contrast to the previous work, SA-VQA integrates structured graph information to guide dual Transformers; consequently, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
In addition, we validate our model via our comprehensive ablation studies, showing each component’s validity.
Guidance from the graph significantly improves the overall performance.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments to test the impact of semantic graphs with different levels of accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a better pre-trained SNS model or a more accurate scene graph improves overall performance.
The study of integrating structured alignment into VQA is still in its infancy.
One open issue is pre-training a good semantic graph model to obtain clean and tidy scene information.
The proposed SA-VQA is a bold attempt towards this issue. However, we expect there will be more research results in the future.</p>
