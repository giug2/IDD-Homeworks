<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces a new federated learning scheme that leverages over-the-air computation. A novel feature of this scheme is the proposal to employ adaptive weights during aggregation, a facet treated as predefined in other over-the-air schemes. This can mitigate the impact of wireless channel conditions on learning performance, without needing channel state information at transmitter side (CSIT). We provide a mathematical methodology to derive the convergence bound for the proposed scheme in the context of computational heterogeneity and general loss functions, supplemented with design insights. Accordingly, we propose aggregation cost metrics and efficient algorithms to find optimized weights for the aggregation. Finally,
through numerical experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Even with the challenges posed by channel conditions and device heterogeneity, the proposed scheme surpasses other over-the-air strategies by an accuracy improvement of <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="15\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">15</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">15</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">15\%</annotation></semantics></math> over the scheme using CSIT and <math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="30\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">30</mn><mo id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.2">30</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">30\%</annotation></semantics></math> compared to the one without CSIT.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As wireless edge devices such as phones, smart watches, sensors, and autonomous vehicles become more prevalent and powerful, there is a growing need to use machine learning to train a global model— a unified algorithm that learns patterns from diverse data sources over these devices. However, it is often not possible to transfer such large amounts of data from the devices to a central server due to latency, power, bandwidth, and data privacy concerns. A distributed approach called federated learning (FL) is a promising solution as it enables machine learning to be implemented directly at the wireless edge without transferring data off the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This method can be applied to a variety of applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In FL, the model training is performed locally at each device with the help of a parameter server, and the process of parallel model updates along with aggregation at the server is performed iteratively until it reaches convergence. FL is often conducted over unreliable wireless networks with limited resources and power constraints. In these networks, devices and the edge server communicate via a shared wireless propagation medium, making communication efficiency a critical challenge for FL. Conventional methods, including those using digital communications, segregate communication and computation tasks. These methods typically employ orthogonal multiple access techniques to avoid interference, requiring separate transmissions from each device to the server in distinct resource blocks, leading to significant communication latency and resource requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. A cost-effective FL scheme is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> to address these challenges by optimally determining the number of devices to select and the number of local iterations in each training round. FL using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques via digital communications is also proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. While this approach reduces resource usage, the interference acts as additional noise. This is because aggregation is performed only after the individual decoding for each device is complete.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> is a promising scheme based on analog communications that leverages the superposition property of wireless channels, allowing simultaneous multiple access transmissions from edge devices within a single resource block. Based on this scheme, an approach known as over-the-air FL is proposed to perform aggregation under the interference, by merging communication and computation. Over-the-air FL can function with remarkably fewer resources and lower latency compared to FL using orthogonal transmissions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Additionally, over-the-air FL utilizes interference by directly recovering the aggregation function as a whole, without any individual recovery for each device, unlike NOMA approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, the aggregation process in over-the-air FL is prone to estimation errors due to the severe effects of wireless channel fading on communication links. This research presents a novel approach to tackle these challenges in over-the-air FL.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most previous research on over-the-air FL has assumed the necessity of perfect channel state information at transmitter side (CSIT) for all the devices. Using a power allocation approach for the purpose of channel compensation, this information aids in adjusting transmission powers and phases, thereby rectifying the misalignment between wireless channels and predefined aggregation weights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. However, this approach places a substantial burden on channel estimation training and feedback
mechanisms for each device, leading to increased latency before each transmission and a notable decrease in spectral and energy efficiency. It also requires perfect synchronization among the transmitters, each equipped with extra hardware for accurate channel adjustments. Additionally, poor channel conditions may either prevent a device from contributing to the learning process or require it to use substantial transmission power. This situation results in signal distortions and imperfect aggregation due to the inherent physical limitations on the maximum and average power capacities of each device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Hence, this approach presents certain challenges when applied to low-cost distributed learning across a large number of devices, particularly those with limited power and hardware capabilities. The common strategy to power allocation is truncated power allocation, where each transmitter only needs to know its own channel, referred to as local CSIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Another strategy involves joint device selection and power allocation schemes, as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. These studies require global knowledge of all channels at every device before each transmission, referred to as global CSIT, to centralize the allocation optimization process. This differs from the distributed approach of the truncated power allocation. At its core, the device selection strategy aims to include the maximum number of devices in each communication round, as an aggregation metric, ensuring that an estimation cost term remains beneath a tolerable threshold for a predefined aggregation. Additionally, there have been power allocation strategies that rely on the presence of knowledge regarding model and data statistics, as referenced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. This prerequisite can constrain the utility of over-the-air FL in various applications.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many current wireless systems transmit blindly using a constant power. Indeed, apart from eliminating the need for CSIT, there are several advantages to transmitting without explicitly compensating for the channel. Primarily, it facilitates maintaining the average transmission energy of the signal regardless of the channel conditions. Also, it prevents the enlargement of the dynamic range of the transmitted signal without any adaptation for channel compensations, thereby significantly reducing the complexity of hardware implementation requirements. Lastly, efforts to correct the channel at the transmitter could be compromised by channel estimation errors, leading to values at the receiver that are multiplied by unpredictable gains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Taking these into account,
the idea of a blind over-the-air FL approach has become increasingly prominent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The studies in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> delve into blind over-the-air FL without any compensation for the detrimental effects of fading. They confirm that despite these factors, convergence is still assured. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, blind over-the-air schemes are presented that leverage multiple antennas and rely on channel state information at the receiver side (CSIR). Nonetheless, these schemes necessitate large multiple receiver antennas, and the effects of wireless fading become less severe as the number of antennas tends toward infinity. In addition, a blind scheme that uses lattice coding at the device, along with a sufficiently large number of receiver antennas and CSIR at the server, is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Contrary to the common use of analog modulation in over-the-air FL, this scheme is designed for digital modulation.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel over-the-air FL scheme named weighted over-the-air FL (WAFeL) to counteract the negative impact of wireless channels on the learning convergence performance by leveraging adaptive aggregation weights. Importantly, WAFeL operates as a blind scheme, eliminating the need for CSIT. Without channel compensation at the transmitter end, this approach is shown to be effective in mitigating estimation error of the aggregation caused by different wireless channel conditions of the devices. This remains the case even when deploying a single-antenna server. Our approach uniquely introduces using aggregation weights as optimizable parameters, where channel compensation is one of the objectives addressed. This sets it apart from other blind schemes that either forgo compensation altogether or need an extensive number of antennas for the same. In summary, our proposal offers the following major contributions.</p>

The seminal paper on FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> originally presented this aggregation method assuming ideal transmission circumstances and perfect aggregation estimation. However, subsequent research on over-the-air FL has continued to use the same aggregation method, regardless of interference and transmission imperfections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. In contrast, our work employs adaptive aggregation weights to mitigate aggregation estimation error and its effects, while a desirable learning performance is ensured. Furthermore, while most previous over-the-air FL research has not incorporated the computational heterogeneity of devices in their scheme design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, our approach integrates varying batch sizes across devices based on their computational strengths and a deadline.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Under our central assumption, we either lack knowledge of the channel gain or the information we do have contains substantial inaccuracies, thus complicating its effective use. Instead, our methodology gravitates towards the partial channel phase, providing a more reliable and consistent foundation for our proposed scheme in Section III. This is in line with other blind over-the-air FL schemes and also many conventional wireless systems, avoiding channel compensation at transmitter side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. This approach achieves consistent average signal energy across varying channel conditions, minimizes the dynamic range of the signal, and simplifies the complexity of device hardware. It stands out as an especially viable option for large-scale IoT applications that rely on devices with limited capabilities.<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">4</span>Should there be access to perfect channel gain knowledge at the devices, our scheme can be modified to adjust transmission powers accordingly, enhancing performance. However, the potential for improvement might be limited, as evidenced by the results in Figs. 8 and 9. Exploring this further remains an avenue for future research. In this work, our primary goal is to examine the mere potential of adjustable aggregation weights.</span></span></span></p>

This characteristic distinguishes WAFeL from these schemes reliant on power allocation, which enforce average and maximum power limits and inherently include device selection. In WAFeL, every device contribute to learning without such restrictions, using an aggregation weight specifically designed for its communication and heterogeneity conditions.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The analysis of WAFeL in terms of convergence rate is presented in the following theorem. To shed light on the novelty of our analysis, it is important to emphasize that most convergence studies in this domain largely delve into scenarios characterized by equal aggregation weights, equal batch sizes, ideal communication conditions, or strongly convex loss functions. These studies navigate under an array of assumptions related to learning parameters. In contrast, our analysis boasts flexibility and is tailored to address general loss functions. This not only facilitates easy recognition of the impacts of the scheme’s parameters, potential imperfections, and device heterogeneity, but also paves the way for recommending universally-applicable aggregation cost metrics, as elaborated in Section V. Notably, our analysis is based on a minimal set of assumptions commonly found in the literature, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, as</p>

negative. Therefore, the lowest value of the objective is achieved by a weight vector without any constraints, which is also appropriate for aggregation. In the absence of phase compensation, the solution might not necessarily consist of all positive elements, rendering it unsuitable for aggregation. An alternative is to seek another weight vector with entirely positive entries to minimize the objective. However, this approach is detrimental to performance, especially with a single-antenna server, a primary assumption in this study.</p>

Moreover, it closely approximates the performance achieved by the orthogonal case. Surprisingly, WAFeL, which incorporates partial phase compensation, outperforms schemes like BAA that have perfect gain and phase compensation. This performance improvement is attributed to the utilization of optimized adaptive weights in the aggregation process, which was not previously identified, coupled with the unique receiver structure. It is noteworthy that in contrast to BAA where each device needs to adhere to both average and maximum power constraints for power allocation and there is an inherent device selection, the weight allocation in WAFeL is not subjected to any limitations and all the devices contribute to the learning.</p>

<p id="S6.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Also, WAFeL, which is based on analog communications, significantly outperforms NOMA, which is based on digital communications. This is mainly because in NOMA, not only is interference considered as additional noise when decoding individual model parameters of the devices, but also model parameters must be quantized into finite bits limited by the available resource block before transmission, further adding quantization errors. On the other hand, in WAFeL, the aggregation is estimated directly, and aggregation weights are optimally designed to maximize convergence performance.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduced a unique over-the-air federated learning scheme incorporating a novel weighted aggregation approach. In the scheme, the adaptive choice of aggregation weights helps counteract the impacts of wireless channels on performance, eliminating the need for channel compensation at the transmitting end. By considering device heterogeneity via diverse batch sizes, we analyzed the convergence rate of the learning process for the scheme as a function of the aggregation weights, which also includes both communication and learning factors. To select the aggregation weights, we proposed aggregation cost metrics based on the analysis. We presented efficient algorithms to optimize the metrics, and also derived an achievable bound on the convergence rate. Despite channel conditions and device heterogeneity, experimental results demonstrated the high learning accuracy of the proposed scheme, surpassing existing solutions even the one with channel compensation at transmitters. Moreover, the proposed scheme can closely attain the level of performance that would be expected in the absence of any errors. Consequently, the proposed scheme, which emphasizes aggregation weight optimization, offers a promising new learning framework that can be further explored in various setups for its potential applications.</p>
