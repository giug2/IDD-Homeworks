<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Medical health care centers are envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data of COVID-19 patients using artificial intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training the model in a single organization, which is most common weakness due to the privacy and security of raw data communication. To solve this challenging task, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework that provides collaborative data training solutions by coordinating multiple hospitals to train and share encrypted federated models without leakage of data privacy. The blockchain ledger technology provides the decentralization of federated learning model without any central server. The proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of model to preserve the privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: i) train the local model by a novel capsule network to segmentation and classify COVID-19 images, ii) then use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, and finally the model is shared over a decentralized platform through proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm. The
integration of blockchain and federated learning leads to a new paradigm for medical image data sharing in the decentralized network. The conducted experimental results
demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The drastic spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) around the globe has caused a large number of deaths in a year. The COVID-19 virus causes acute respiratory disease, which directly infects the human lungs, resulting in intensive breathing difficulty. Due to the highly contagious nature, COVID-19 detection remains among high-priority tasks. Currently, various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are under exploration to discover better solutions to detect it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Particularly, a significant portion of the research is focused on CT scan images in the past year as it proved to be a more reliable source to detect the infection. However, these techniques often require a large amount of data from a single source (hospital or research center) to train the classification model to predict more accurately. In contrast, data from a single source lacks the feature distribution variance. TThe less variation in data directly leads to sampling error and high model loss, affecting the diagnosis results in terms of accuracy. The data variation problem can be solved if many hospitals can share the data. However, the reason data confidentiality and privacy restrict multiple hospitals to share the data to train the model. Due to this issue, traditional learning, where only local data is considered, may not fit properly. In contrast, the transfer learning enables sharing the model instead of sharing the data. The transfer learning exploit a general pre-trained model and modifies it with accordance to local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Yet, the sensitivity of a local model totally depends on the quality of the pre-trained model. Let us take a scenario in a rural area hospital with insufficient data to train the model. However, the hospital can collaborate with another hospital while considering the same goal without sharing the data. However, transfer learning still confines the base model to increase more robustness while taking benefit from local data of the hospital. Due to this reason, hospitals are unable to get the full benefit from AI.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the federated learning technique is introduced to solve the problem by collaboratively training the model without physically exchanging the model itself. The collaborative model solves the data variance issue and enables the evolution of the model over time for all hospitals. Generally, it is a collaborative learning framework of federated learning which enables multiple collaborators to train their local model and send the learned weights to a centralized server where they are aggregated into a global model. This procedure of gaining knowledge is in the form of a consensus model without moving patient data beyond the firewalls of parent data recording centers (hospital or research center). To this point, the learning process occurs locally at each participating institution, and only the model characteristics are transferred to a federated server for global model training. Originally federated learning was developed for different domains, such as distributed learning, edge device, and mobile computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Due to its vast scope of applicability, it has gained considerable research attention for healthcare applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Recent research has proven that models trained by federated learning can achieve a comparable levels of performance to ones trained on centrally hosted medical data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. However, still there exist security issue of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, where the users can share the gradients to verify the security and privacy of the data. To this end, their methodology was exposed to vulnerability even for passive attackers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the security and scalability issues, the blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive to provide model decentralization without involving any central server. Particularly blockchain provides the facility to collect the data model securely from the different points or locations (i.e., Japan, China, Pakistan, USA, UK) to train the global model. The recent works focus on federated learning using central server topology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, none of the above considers blockchain-based federated learning to decentralize the global model in medical image analysis. Therefore, there still exist the gap between secure federated learning without the dependency of a central server to provide secure model sharing and trust issue for data providers (e.g., hospital).</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by a current situation where the model needs to update continuously to deal with new types of COVID-virus over time while considering the above-discussed issues. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates privacy-preserving federated learning over the decentralized blockchain. To train the local model, we design a capsule network based on segmentation and classification to detect the COVID-19 images. Our segmentation network aims to extract nodules from the chest CT images. For each locally trained model, gradients are encrypted using a homomorphic encryption technique to preserve the privacy of each hospital. In this encryption technique, the hospitals are assigned the same secret key to reducing the communication overhead for high-dimensional data in neural networks. In this way, the client’s or users’ side encryption knowledge, which guarantees user privacy and blockchain, ensures the data’s reliability. The task of aggregation and learning the global model is trained over the blockchain. We exploit the Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) to reduce the computation efficiency of the blockchain.

that enables training a shared model without leakage the hospitals
privacy. Moreover, federated learning has introduced a mechanism to
collect the data from various parties or hospitals without leakage
the hospitals privacy. The advantage of the federated learning model
is reducing the resources (i.e., memory, power) consummation of a
single participant and improving the quality of the training model.
In other words, federated learning learn the model collaboratively
and share the trained model in the local machines. More detail, each

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Homomorphic encryption allows the calculation of encrypted data (ciphertext)
without decryption. The new encrypted data matches the result of the
operation performed on the unencrypted data after decryption. We utilized
the BGV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> ncryption scheme, which takes
as input the secret key with large noise and outputs an unencrypted
data of the same data with a fixed amount of noise. Additionally,
a key-switching procedure which text encrypt data and output the same
message. We refer to the detailed encryption scheme for readers in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we used homomorphic encryption
to encrypt the gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to
share the data in the blockchain distributed network. The previous
research shares the encrypted gradients and shares to the centralized
server<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. They do not consider
a distributed blockchain network. The problem of a blockchain database
is cost-effective. For that reason, we use homomorphic to encrypt
the model and train the local model to the global model.</p>

the data from multiple sources without leakage the privacy and authentication

distributed ledger to update the global AI model. The blockchain collects
the data model from different nodes and aggregates the local and global
model. The smart contract uploaded the weights and updated the models.
The proposed architecture integrates blockchain with federated learning
for full decentralization and enhancing security. Also, decentralization
provides more accuracy of the model and enables the poisoning-attack-proof.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We design a Capsule Network because it achieves high performance in detecting
diseases in the medical images. The previous technique needs lots
of data to train a more accurate model. The Capsule Network improves
the deep learning models’ performance inside the internal layers of
the deep learning models. The architecture of our modified Capsule
Network is similar to Hinton Capsule Network. The Capsule network
contains four layers: i)convolutional layer, ii) hidden layer, iii)
PrimaryCaps layer, and iv) DigitCaps layer.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p2.3" class="ltx_p">A capsule is created when input features are in the lower layer. Each
layer of the Capsule Network contains many capsules. To train the
capsule network, the activation layer represents instantiate parameters
of the entity and compute the length of the capsule network to re-compute
the scores for the feature part. Capsule Networks is a better replacement
for Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Here, the capsule acts as a neuron.
Unlike ANN where a neuron outputs a scalar value, capsule networks
tend to describe an image at a component level and associate a vector
with each component. The probability of the existence of a component
is represented by this vectors length and replaces max-pooling with
”routing by agreement”. As capsules are independents the probability
of correct classification increases when multiple capsules agree on
the same parameters. Every component can be represented by a pose

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main goal of this section is to exaggeration of the global model
with the blockchain DAG mechanism. The local DAG is responsible for
synchronous global training via federated learning. However, the storage
capability is improved to store the model in the DAG. Based on the
federated learning and permissioned blockchain, the following steps
to adjust the decentralized model aggravation. Firstly select the
nodes of the users and then local train and encrypt the weights. Then
aggregate the weights in the global model. The consensus (i.e., POW)
for data sharing is high cost. To address the problem of the high
cost, we proposed a hybrid DAG based scheme is provided in Algorithm
2. However, we combine the update weight process of federated learning
with the quality verification process using the blockchain DAG. The

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past, Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained a reputable position
in the field of clinical medicine. And in such chaotic situations,
AI can help the medical practitioners to validate the disease detection
process, hence increasing the reliability of the diagnosis methods
and save precious human lives. Currently, the biggest challenge faced
by AI-based methods is the availability of relevant data. AI cannot
progress without the availability of abundant and relevant data.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce a small new dataset related to the latest
family of coronavirus i.e. COVID-19. Such datasets play an important
role in the domain of artificial intelligence for clinical medicine
related applications. This data set contains the Computed Tomography
scan (CT) slices for 89 subjects. Out of these 89 subjects, 68 were
confirmed patients (positive cases) of the COVID-19 virus, and the
rest 21 were found to be negative cases. The proposed dataset CC-19
contains 34,006 CT scan slices (images) belonging to 89 subjects out
of which 28,395 CT scan slices belong to positive COVID-19 patients.
This dataset is made publicly available via GitHub (https://github.com/abdkhanstd/COVID-19).
Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Fig. 5 ‣ 4.1 Dataset ‣ 4 SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ‣ Blockchain based Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Medical Images: A Case Study of COVID-19 CT Scans" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows some 2D slices taken from CT scans
of the CC-19 dataset. Moreover, some selected 3D samples from the
dataset are shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Fig. 6 ‣ 4.1 Dataset ‣ 4 SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ‣ Blockchain based Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Medical Images: A Case Study of COVID-19 CT Scans" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. The Hounsfield
unit (HU) is the measurement of CT scans radiodensity as shown in
Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.1 Dataset ‣ 4 SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ‣ Blockchain based Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Medical Images: A Case Study of COVID-19 CT Scans" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Usually, CT scanning devices are carefully calibrated
to measure the HU units. This unit can be employed to extract the
relevant information in CT Scan slices. The CT scan slices have cylindrical
scanning bounds. For unknown reasons, the pixel information that lies
outside this cylindrical bound was automatically discarded by the
CT scanner system. But fortunately, this discarding of outer pixels
eliminates some steps for preprocessing.</p>

and privacy concerns observed the hospitals and medical practitioners.
Keeping in view these norms, this dataset was collected in the earlier
days of the epidemic from various hospitals in Chengdu, the capital
city of Sichuan. Initially, the dataset was in an extremely raw form.
We preprocessed the data and found many discrepancies with most of
the collected CT scans. Finally, the CT scans, with discrepancies,
were discarded from the proposed dataset. All the CT scans are different
from each other i.e. CT scans have a different number of slices for
different patients. We believe that the possible reasons behind the
altering number of slices are the difference in height and body structure
of the patients. Moreover, upon inspecting various literature, we
found that the volume of the lungs of an adult female is, comparatively,
ten to twelve percent smaller than a male of the same height and age

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the proposed method’s performance, we adopted the federated
learning model as a classifier to conduct the experimentation. We
analyze and evaluate our model in terms of accuracy. The deep learning
model; contains fully connected convolutional layers, where each of
the layers consists of 128 neurons. Two factors affect the accuracy
and running time of the federated learning model: the number of hospitals
and gradients per hospital. We analyzed both factors on different
ranges of values, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Fig. 7 ‣ 4.3 Performance Analysis ‣ 4 SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ‣ Blockchain based Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Medical Images: A Case Study of COVID-19 CT Scans" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Fig. 8 ‣ 4.3 Performance Analysis ‣ 4 SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ‣ Blockchain based Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Medical Images: A Case Study of COVID-19 CT Scans" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>,
respectively. <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">shows the execution time and accuracy
with a different number of iteration. Here the number of iteration
indicates the completed update of parameters. We compared the effect
with the different number of gradients per hospital, and we distributed
data to over six hospitals. To conduct the experimentation on basic
setting, we only assumed the condition where no user has dropped out.
It can be clearly seen that increasing the number of gradients per
hospital leads towards higher accuracy, whereas it causes the computation
overhead as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7.sf2" title="In Fig. 7 ‣ 4.3 Performance Analysis ‣ 4 SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ‣ Blockchain based Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Medical Images: A Case Study of COVID-19 CT Scans" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7b</span></a>.</span>
Therefore, to reduce the computation overhead in a practical environment,
an appropriate number of gradients can be empirically chosen. In terms
of model iterations, it can be observed that model accuracy converges
after a certain number of iterations.</p>

gradients) also depends on the size of the data and the number of
selected hospitals. We analyzed the accuracy over a different number
of users to train the model. The classification accuracy and execution
time can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Fig. 8 ‣ 4.3 Performance Analysis ‣ 4 SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ‣ Blockchain based Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Medical Images: A Case Study of COVID-19 CT Scans" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. Similar to the previous observation,
naturally increasing numbers of iterations and hospitals consume high
computation cost. However, due to independent gradient computation
on each user, the number of hospitals leads to high accuracy. Basically,
the data is split into many chunks as per hospital; therefore, the
local gradient will be calculated and combined to produce high accuracy.</span></p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This article proposed a secure data sharing scheme for the distributed
multiple hospitals for the internet of things applications, which
incorporate local model training and secure global training. We secure
the local model through the homomorphic encryption scheme, which helps
build an intelligent model without leakage the data provider’s privacy
and create trust in the data training process. However, the blockchain-based
algorithm aggregates the local model updates and provides the authentication
of the data. The experiment results confirm the accuracy and effectiveness
of the model. In future work, to enhance the latency of the blockchain
and minimize the cost-effective solution.</p>
