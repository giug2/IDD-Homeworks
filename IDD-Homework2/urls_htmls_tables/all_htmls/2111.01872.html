<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent advances in Federated Learning (FL) have brought large-scale collaborative machine learning opportunities for massively distributed clients with performance and data privacy guarantees. However, most current works focus on the interest of the central controller in FL,
and overlook the interests of the FL clients.
This may result in unfair treatment of clients that discourages them from actively participating in the learning process and damages the sustainability of the FL ecosystem.
Therefore, the topic of ensuring fairness in FL is attracting a great deal of research interest. In recent years, diverse Fairness-Aware FL (FAFL) approaches have been proposed in an effort to achieve fairness in FL from different perspectives. However, there is no comprehensive survey that helps readers gain insight into this interdisciplinary field.
This paper aims to provide such a survey.
By examining the fundamental and simplifying assumptions, as well as the notions of fairness adopted by existing literature in this field, we propose a taxonomy of FAFL approaches covering major steps in FL, including client selection, optimization, contribution evaluation and incentive distribution. In addition, we discuss the main metrics for experimentally evaluating the performance of FAFL approaches, and suggest promising future research directions towards FAFL.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL)
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a new machine learning paradigm for collaboratively training models involving multiple data owners (a.k.a. clients) with the aim to protect data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Fairness-Aware Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Its potential to help the field of artificial intelligence (AI) thrive in privacy-respecting societies has attracted increasing attention from academia and industry alike. During federated model training, the data owners contribute not only their local data, but also computation and communication resources to facilitate collaborative model training.
As the quality and quantity of the data, as well as the local resources vary among data owners, their contributions to the final FL model will vary.
This, in turn, may affect the benefits they receive from the data federations they join, in cases where FL incentive mechanisms are deployed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Ensuring fairness in FL is an emerging research challenge that requires an interdisciplinary approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Since the FL server is the controller, it should ideally not make decisions that unfairly favour any particular group of data owners.
However, in most current FL paradigms, fair treatment of data owners is not given a high priority. Problems of fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> can arise throughout the FL training process, as described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, unfairness may arise in the stage of <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client selection</span>. Methods have been proposed for client selection in FL, but most of them focus only on the server’s interest (e.g., increasing convergence speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> or enhancing the model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>). These methods favor clients who can respond quickly or contribute to better final model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. As a result, clients with weaker capabilities might be excluded from the FL process. This reduces weaker clients’ chances of (i) receiving a model that fits their local data distributions well, and (ii) receiving any incentives which might be involved.
From the server’s perspective, the final model may not generalize well because the excluded clients may contain samples that the current model does not cover.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, fairness issues can also occur during FL model <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">optimization</span>.
When performing the global optimization by aggregating clients’ model updates, the server aims to minimize a loss function under a specific distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, this distribution may not be able to capture the diversity of the entire distributed training set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, leading to prediction biases on individual clients’ local datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Thirdly, unfairness can occur during FL <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">incentive distribution</span>. In FL, rewards (monetary or otherwise) may be needed to compensate for clients’ local resources (e.g., computation power, battery power, communication bandwidth) and motivate participation.
Under the standard FL setting, the FL system distributes the same aggregated model as rewards to all the clients.
However, such a scheme ignores the fact that local updates of clients are of inconsistent qualities due to diverse local dataset qualities and training capabilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The scheme can be perceived as unfair by clients who contribute more significantly to the final FL model performance.
Such a problem, referred to as the free-rider issue in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, can discourage future participation of high-quality FL clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which in turn harms the FL system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Last but not least, <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">contribution evaluation</span> is an essential step in FL to promote fairness in the <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client selection</span> and <span id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">incentive distribution</span> stages. Contribution evaluation in FL aims to estimate the contribution made by each client without exposing its private local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The evaluation can be based on self-reported information such as data quantity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, data quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, or observations on marginal model improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. FL schemes that use client contribution as a reference to select high-quality clients in order to improve model performance are emerging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. FL incentive schemes also often take client contribution evaluation results into account <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Thus, unfairness in FL client contribution evaluation can have a far-reaching impact throughout the FL pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">These fairness-related issues can have an adverse impact on both the FL clients and the FL server if not handled properly. On the one hand, unfair treatment can discourage clients from joining FL training. On the other hand, blindly treating clients equally without regard to their potential contributions can reduce the server’s ability to attract high-quality clients, resulting in FL models that may not generalize well. Hence, ensuring fairness in FL is essential as it is the key to sustainable healthy collaboration in such an ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">As FL research is attracting increasingly significant attention, many survey papers have been published. They provide different perspectives on various topics about FL.

Lim et al. 2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> reviews the methods and applications of FL in the context of mobile edge networks.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to understand the background of existing FAFL approaches, it is important to examine the assumptions made in existing FL approaches. As horizontal federated learning (HFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is currently the most studied FL approach, we focus our discussions on HFL settings.
The main aim of HFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> is to allow multiple data owners to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving the privacy of sensitive local data.

Then, the clients train models locally and upload them to the server for aggregation.</p>

Each notion focuses on a particular aspect and the interest of a specific group of stakeholders. Thus, it is not suitable to compare the relative merits of these fairness notions.

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One source of potential unfair treatment of FL clients is the FL client selection approach. Many approaches focus on serving the FL server’s interest (e.g., increasing convergence speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> or enhancing the model accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>), while ignoring the interests of the FL clients. These works typically use threshold-based approaches to select FL clients (e.g., <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedCS</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>) Such approaches commonly use thresholds (e.g., transmission speed, bandwidth, local accuracy, etc.) to filter out unqualified clients and select high-quality clients.
For example, mobile edge FL systems are often sensitive to network transmission rates. In such cases, data owners with higher transmission rates are more likely to be selected, while those with consistently poor channel conditions may never be selected. However, this brings up another problem of oversampling of clients from specific groups, which leads to the global FL model biasing towards the data
owned by these clients, hence causing model performance deterioration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Moreover, these approaches threaten the interests of clients. The continued participation of clients is the key to maintaining the long-term sustainable operation of an FL system. However, under the threshold-based approaches, clients with the relatively poor quality might not get the chance to join FL (a.k.a. unfair selection among clients). As a result, they cannot receive any rewards. This drives these clients to leave the system, resulting in the attrition of FL participants. Hence, it is crucial to pursue fairness in FL client selection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is important to note that fair client selection does not mean selecting everyone with equal probabilities. The heterogeneity among clients also needs to be considered. To achieve fairness in client selection, FAFL approaches need to strike a balance between the interests of the FL server and those of the FL clients. In this section, we review existing FAFL client selection approaches. These works can be divided into two categories: 1) considering fairness factors to ensure that each client has a reasonable probability to be selected, and 2) customizing the model and training procedure for each client.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the bias against FL clients with lower computational capabilities or smaller datasets, recent works study the design of sampling constraints for addressing fair client selection.

This constraint applies a constant fairness parameter to ensure that the average participation rate of every client is no less than the expected guaranteed rate. A Lyapunov optimization-based framework has been proposed to transfer the original offline problem into an online optimization problem, where FL clients’ participation rates are optimized through a queuing dynamics approach.
Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> also utilizes a fairness constraint to reserve a certain probability of selection for each client. However, instead of using dynamic queues, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> adapts the Exp3 algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> for the adversarial bandit to calculate the selection probability for each round. Moreover, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, the fairness parameter that is used to determine the selection probability in each round is not necessarily the same.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another approach to FAFL client selection focuses on customized model settings or customized training procedures. System heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity are two key challenges in the deployment of FL applications. However, despite the client heterogeneity, current FL paradigms often distribute the same initial models to all clients at the beginning of training rounds.
As a result, clients with lower capabilities
(in terms of computing hardware, network connections, etc.)
can often be excluded from subsequent rounds. The reason for this is that these clients need more time to complete model training and would be perceived as stragglers by the FL server.
To mitigate this problem, works have been proposed to dynamically adapt the FL model framework or the training procedure based on client capabilities. It promotes fairness by enabling under-represented or never-represented clients to participate in FL.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Dropout (FD)</span> was proposed.
It allows each FL client to receive a sub-model with a size suitable for local training based on its computational resources. The model updates from the clients are then reconstructed by the FL server and aggregated to form the global model.

For fully connected layers, a number of activations are often dropped. For convolutional layers, a fixed ratio of filters are often dropped.
This reduces the computational and communication costs, as smaller sub-models enable more efficient local training and model exchanges between the FL server and the FL clients.
Lossy compression is applied to further reduce the communication cost.
It is a simple approach that can be applied to CNN-based FL frameworks. By using FD, clients with low capabilities can join FL by training a pruned sub-model.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">FD and AFD promote equitable treatment of heterogeneous clients by allowing those with low capabilities to participate in FL training. However, these two approaches have important limitations. Firstly, both of them forward the same pruned model to all clients in a single round, and do not investigate how to provide custom pruned submodels to different clients (i.e., clients with strong capabilities are restricted by those with low capabilities and are not allowed to update more weights). Secondly, FD does not provide the computational benefits at the time of inference because the original model is deployed after training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.</p>

OD distributes custom-pruned sub-models to clients based on the clients’ capabilities. Compared to FD, OD drops
adjacent components of the model instead of random neurons.
Clients with similar computational capabilities are divided into clusters. Those in the same cluster use the same dropout rate. This allows clients with better capabilities to update more weights. For those with weaker memory-related capabilities, the knowledge distillation method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> is used to improve model accuracy by enhancing feature extraction for smaller submodels.

Clients with lower capabilities are assigned less work to enable them to pass threshold-based FL client selection. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx</span> was proposed to allow partial training to be performed by each client based on its available resources. Instead of assigning a uniform number of epochs to each client, FedProx allows local epochs to vary. This encourages more clients to participate in training, hence reducing the negative impact of system heterogeneity. However, a large number of local updates may lead each client towards the optima of its local objective as opposed to the global objective, resulting in model divergence in the presence of heterogeneous data. Therefore, a proximal term was introduced to restrict the local updates and stabilize the method.
The proximal term benefits the training process by: (1) encouraging higher-quality local updates by constraining the local updates to be closer to the global model, and (2) safely aggregating local model updates produced generated from different amounts of work. </p>

Client selection can also be affected by a client’s communication capabilities (e.g., bit rates, packet loss). When a client sends its local updates to the server during FL, some packets may be lost. Upon detecting a lost packet, the server sends a retransmission request to the client in an attempt to recover the lost packet. However, for clients with slower networks, the retransmission may cause additional delays in FL model training. Thus, model updates from clients with poorer communication channels are less likely to be aggregated into the final model, thereby resulting in model bias.</p>

The main idea is that a packet loss may not always be harmful. Based on this assumption, TRA accelerates FL training by ignoring some of the lost packets. In the beginning, all participating FL clients indicate their network conditions to the FL server. Based on their reports, the server classifies the clients into the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sufficient</span> type and the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">insufficient</span> type. The server then randomly selects the clients to whom to send the global model, and waits for their model updates. When a packet loss is detected, the server only sends a re-transmission request if the client belongs to the <span id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p8.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sufficient</span> type. Otherwise, it simply records the lost packet as zero. After clients finish uploading, TRA recalculates the aggregation based on the packet loss records. The effectiveness of this approach depends heavily on accurately categorizing the clients into different types. It implicitly assumes that the FL clients can accurately assess their own network conditions and will honestly report this information to the FL server. This assumption may not be realistic in practice.</p>

Consider an image recognition scenario in which the FL server has accessed many mobile devices used by the younger users, but only a few used by other age groups. The model may perform very well on the devices of the younger age group, but not so well on devices of other age groups.

Some existing works with this approach aim to achieve uniform performance across FL clients in terms of prediction accuracy, i.e., performance distribution fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>. They mainly focus on reducing the variance of model accuracy across clients, while maintaining similar average accuracy.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">AFL</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is one of the earliest works to address fairness in FL training. It aims to achieve the good-intent notion of fairness by preventing the overfitting of the model to any particular client at the expense of others. The authors argue that the distribution over clients, adopted in standard HFL, may not coincide with the target distribution. Hence, under AFL, the global model is optimized for any target distribution formed by a mixture of clients. This does not negatively affect the model performance of other clients as long as they do not increase the loss of the worst-performing client. However, AFL is found to perform well only for a small number of clients. When the number of clients becomes large, the generalization guarantees of the model may not be achievable.</p>

A more communication-efficient FL aggregation approach based on q-FFL, <span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p3.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">q-FedAvg</span>, was also proposed. q-FFL achieves a lower variance of accuracy (i.e., higher fairness) and faster convergence than AFL.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although these approaches promote fairness to a certain extent, they fall short in terms of robustness. For example, both q-FFL and AFL are not robust against adversarial attacks. If a client maliciously increases its loss, it can result in a deterioration in model performance by misleading the global objectives of AFL and q-FFL. To improve the model’s robustness while maintaining good-intent fairness, <span id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedMGDA+</span> approach was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. It performs a multi-objective optimization by optimizing the loss function of each FL client separately and simultaneously. It uses Pareto-stationary solutions to find a common descent direction for all selected clients so as to avoid sacrificing the performance of any client. Moreover, two techniques: 1) gradient normalization and 2) a built-in robustness method inspired by the Chebyshev approach, are also incorporated to enhance robustness against inflated loss attacks. Nevertheless, the accurate identification of malicious clients remains an open problem.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> have also addressed the same issue. They proposed a personalized multi-task FL algorithm, called Ditto, which simultaneously improves fairness and robustness. As mentioned earlier, with adversaries, learning globally introduces corruption, while local learning does not generalize well due to the small sample size. Ditto offers a trade-off between these two extremes. After optimizing a global objective function, Ditto allows clients to run finetuning to minimize their individual losses. A regularization term is added to make the personalized models close to the optimal global model. The regularization term in Ditto is similar to the proximal term in FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. The difference is that Ditto learns personalized models, whereas FedProx only learns a global model.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">While the aforementioned approaches have generally focused on performance distribution fairness, research works on group fairness are starting to emerge. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposed a fairness-aware method, AgnosticFair, which examines the group fairness of the model by using kernel re-weighting functions to assign a re-weighting value to each training sample in both the loss function and the fairness constraint. It incorporates an agnostic fairness constraint to achieve the demographic parity notion of fairness. AgnosticFair is designed to deal with data shift scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>. It has been shown to achieve good accuracy and fairness on unknown testing data distribution. Another advantage of AgnosticFair is that fairness can be guaranteed for each local client due to the agnostic fairness constraint, even if the distribution is shifted between the clients and the server. However, prior knowledge is required to determine the re-weighting function. This limits its application in dynamically changing system environments.</p>

framework, FCFL, which achieves good-intent fairness and group fairness simultaneously. Following the idea of AFL, FCFL minimizes the loss of the worst-performing client, leading to a min-max style of fairness guarantees. However, unlike AFL, FCFL utilizes a smooth surrogate maximum function that considers all client objectives instead of using a single non-smooth objective of the worst-performing client. It also adds a fairness constraint on each client to measure disparities across all clients. FCFL employs a gradient-descent-based procedure to find the Pareto solution. The results show that FCFL achieves consistent performance across different clients compared to other methods and also performs significantly better in measuring group fairness. A limitation of FCFL is that it only focuses on local disparity (i.e., client-level group fairness), and it cannot guarantee reasonable global disparity (i.e., group fairness at the global level).</p>

It mitigates gradient conflicts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> among FL clients before averaging the gradients in the global objective function.
The authors argue that the global model could sacrifice model accuracy for some clients for the sake of improving performance for those clients whose gradients differ greatly (These situations often lead to unfairness during FL training).
FedFV uses gradient projection to reduce the conflicts that consist of internal conflicts among selected clients and external conflicts between the selected clients and the unselected clients.
FedFV has been shown to strike a balance between fairness, accuracy, and efficiency.
However, the gradient estimation methods applied to mitigate external conflicts might not be consistently reliable because the estimated gradients based on the previous rounds may become out-of-date and incompatible with the latest updates.
Directly applying the estimated gradients to the latest global updates may cause model divergence. A more reliable gradient estimation method that works in conjunction with the FL client selection approach is needed to address this issue.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Contribution evaluation is a sub-field of FL that allows an FL system to assess the importance for the contribution for each client without having access to its local data. The common approach for obtaining this information is through evaluating each client’s impact on the aggregated FL model performance. The clients’ contribution values may, in turn, be used for client selection and incentive reward distribution in FL. Hence, a fair evaluation of FL clients’ contributions is critical. There have been many data valuation methods designed for non-privacy-preserving machine learning settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>. However, they cannot be directly applied under FL settings. Existing FL contribution evaluation approaches can be divided into five categories: 1) self-reported information, 2) individual evaluation, 3) utility game, 4) Shapley value, and 5) empirical methods.</p>

The server then uses the reported information to assign ratings to the clients. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, the authors applied a similar approach to use self-reported information to build an FL incentive scheme based on Contract Theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>. The server designs contract items and broadcasts them to the data owners. Each item contains rewards and information regarding the clients’ local data.

The clients’ optimal strategy under this game-theoretic setting is to truthfully report their desired prices for one unit of CPU power to the FL task publisher.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A reputation mechanism is widely used to keep track of the historical contribution of an FL participant. The reputation mechanisms are often designed to reflect the participant’s reliability and contribution, which can be leveraged by client selection and reward distribution schemes. They can be used in centralized or decentralized FL systems. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, reputation mechanisms were introduced under centralized FL settings. The reputation values are maintained by the FL server. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, the reputation values are updated based on the validation accuracy achieved by each client. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>, the authors use cosine similarity between a local model update and the server model update to evaluate the client’s reputation.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, the Beta Reputation System <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>, <a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite> is utilized to evaluate the credibility of each client. Based on the value of the loss function, the reputation model classifies client behaviours into positive behaviours or negative behaviours, and then updates the reputation of each client after every round.
For these schemes to work, an accurate and balanced validation dataset is required by the FL server.</p>

Each task publisher calculates a client’s reputation from two sources: 1) direct reputation opinions from interaction histories with the task publisher, and 2) indirect reputation opinions from other task publishers
The indirect reputation opinions are openly shared and are stored in a blockchain so that no party can tamper with the reputation scores.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>, the reputation is evaluated by attack detection schemes. Besides, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite> also uses local computation time for reputation evaluation.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite>, reputation is measured based on the clients’ local model gradient updates in each round.
Each reputation evaluation method has its own limitations.

For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite>, the task publisher uses the local computation time and dataset size to estimate the proportion of local data the client has dedicated to training the FL model. This method is susceptible to cheating by misbehaving clients who intentionally lengthen their local computation times so as to appear to be using a large proportion of local data for training. For <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite>, the task publisher needs to save all local models and the global model during all historical rounds of training. This can result in a high storage overhead as the number of clients and/or the number of training iterations increase.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Besides reputation, there are other approaches for evaluating a FL client’s individual contribution. Zeng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed a score function based on each client’s bid and resource quality under an auction-based FL client selection scheme. The top-scoring clients are selected to participate in FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a mutual evaluation-based approach for pairs of FL participants to assess each other’s potential value.

To improve the efficiency of SV calculation, many heuristic methods have been proposed in traditional machine learning (e.g., Truncated Monte Carlo Shapley (TMC-Shapley) and Gradient Shapley <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>).

Song et al. 2019 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed two gradient-based SV methods: 1) One-Round Reconstruction (OR) and 2) Multi-Round Reconstruction (MR). Both methods gather gradient updates from FL clients to reconstruct the FL model, instead of retraining with different subsets of clients. OR gathers all the gradient updates over all the training rounds. Then, it reconstructs the models for all the subsets in the final round. OR calculates SV only once by using the reconstructed models in the final round. In contrast, MR calculates a set of SVs in each round of training, and then aggregates them to compute the final SV-based contribution values. Wei et al. 2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> extended MR to propose the Truncated Multi-Round (TMR) method. TMR improves on MR in two ways. Firstly, it assigns higher weights to the training rounds with higher accuracy values. Secondly, TMR improves efficiency by skipping the last few rounds.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">By leveraging these gradient-based SV estimation methods, the efficiency of evaluating FL client contribution can be significantly improved. However, we still need to evaluate the sub-models for different subsets of clients in each round of training. To further reduce the computational cost, Wang et al. 2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed two efficient approximation approaches to improve the efficiency of within-round SV calculation, inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>: 1) permutation sampling-based approximation, and 2) group testing-based approximation.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite> proposed the Guided Truncation Gradient Shapley (GTG-Shapley) approach which combines between-round and within-round truncation to further reduce the training cost. Between-round truncation eliminates entire rounds of SV when the remaining marginal gain is small. Within-round truncation skips the remaining sub-model evaluation in permutations when the remaining marginal gain is small.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite>, Shapley value is leveraged to calculate the feature importance in VFL. Since directly using SV to evaluate each prediction could reveal the potentially sensitive features, the authors proposed to perform SV calculation on groups of features instead of on each individual feature. However, this method is still computationally expensive since the computational cost increases exponentially with the training data size.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data-based counterfactual contribution evaluation, such as Shapley Value, has produced promising results for FL contribution evaluation. However, their high computational costs and imprecision as a result of estimation to enhance efficiency still limit their scalability. Empirical methods for contribution evaluation have been studied as alternatives to theory-based FL client contribution evaluation. Shyn et al. 2021 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite> proposed FedCCEA, which learns the data quality of each client by constructing an Accuracy Approximation Model (AAM) with sampled data size. This method robustly and efficiently approximates the client’s contribution by using the sampled data size, and allows partial participation by clients through setting the desired sizes of local data to be used for FL model training. FedCCEA consists of a simulator and an evaluator.
The simulator obtains the inputs (i.e., sampled data size) and the targets (i.e., round-wise accuracy) of AAM by running one-epoch FL classification tasks. Then, the evaluator optimizes the weight vectors from AMM by using the stored inputs and targets. After model convergence, the shared weights of the first layer are extracted to learn the importance for data size for each client. Nevertheless, since AAM is built upon a very simple neural network architecture, FedCCEA is currently limited to simple FL tasks, making it less well-suited for practical applications.

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works on FL usually assume that FL clients are always willing to join FL when invited. However, in reality, FL clients may be reluctant to join the training, as 1) clients need to contribute their computational/communication resources, and 2) the malicious attackers may still infer the private information of training data from the local gradients. Such training costs and security risks hamper clients’ continued participation.
Imagine when an FL platform invites companies from the same business sector for the FL tasks. The companies are generally reluctant to join FL since contributing their data to train a federated model that is subsequently shared with potential competitors can incur significant opportunity costs to a company.
Hence, fair incentive mechanisms, which provide satisfactory compensation arrangements, should be designed for FL to encourage companies (a.k.a, data owners) to participate in collaborative model training.
A fair incentive mechanism distributes "fair" rewards to FL clients based on their contributions and training costs. For higher accuracy of the client model updates, there will be an increase in the reward for the corresponding clients, such that the system can attract high-quality clients to join the training continually.
Many incentive mechanisms for FL have been proposed in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Not all of them focus on enhancing fairness. For example, in Stackelberg game-based FL scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite>, the server and the clients compete to optimize their own utilities. The equilibrium solution of the game achieves a trade-off between the two parties, but might not be fair. In this section, we focus on FL incentive mechanism designs that take fairness into consideration.
Different approaches and fairness criteria have been proposed. We classify these incentive mechanisms into two categories: 1) Monetary Incentive Mechanisms, which distribute monetary payoffs to FL clients; and 2) Non-Monetary Incentive Mechanisms, which use FL models with different levels of performance to incentivize FL clients.</p>

Although it uses game theory to derive the optimal strategy for distributing profits among the clients (which accounts for competition among data owners), it takes fairness into consideration during contribution evaluation.

However, reputation-based approaches rely on the availability of historical records of FL client performance. The issue of boot-strapping the reputation system in FL needs to be addressed in order for these approaches to operate.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Contract theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> has also been adopted to design FL incentive mechanisms. In mobile networks, there exists information asymmetry between the task publisher and the mobile devices (i.e., the task publisher does not know the data quality, data quantity and available computational resources of each mobile device). It may incur a high cost if it were to monitor such information. To reduce the impact of information asymmetry, Kang et al. 2019 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> applied Contract theory to design an efficient incentive mechanism to attract mobile devices with high-quality data to join FL. It defines a parameter of local data quality as the type of the contract model. The task publisher uses the observations in the previous round to design different contracts for data owners with different data qualities. As a result, devices with higher quality data and more computational resource contribution receive higher rewards from the task publisher. Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> also used Contract theory to design an incentive mechanism for FL in vehicular edge computing settings. It introduces a 2-dimensional contract to determine the appropriate rewards based on clients’ data quality and computational capabilities. One shortcoming of these approaches is that they assume a monopoly market with only one FL task publisher. As the monopolist, the task publisher only provides limited contract choices to each device, which negatively impacts the mobile devices’ profits. In practice, there could be many FL task publishers competing to attract FL clients. Currently, such scenarios have not yet been adequately accounted for by existing FL incentive mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The above-mentioned FL incentive mechanisms implicitly assume that the incentive budget has been pre-determined. There are situations in which the incentive budget is not available at the time of FL model training. Instead, the participants expect to be rewarded with the revenue generated by the FL model at a later time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
To account for this scenario, Yu et al. 2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> defined two notions of fairness criteria that are important to the long-term sustainable operation of FL in addition to contribution fairness: regret distribution fairness and expectation fairness. Regret distribution fairness requires that clients be treated fairly based on their waiting time for receiving their incentive rewards. Since the training and commercialization of the FL models take time, the server may not have enough revenue to compensate the participants at the early stage. This leads to a temporary mismatch between clients’ contribution and the rewards they hitherto receive. To overcome this issue, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> proposed a dynamic payoff-sharing scheme - Federated Learning Incentivizer (FLI) - which dynamically distributes the rewards to the clients by maximizing the collective utility and minimizing inequality between data owners’ regret and waiting time. It ensures that the clients, who have contributed more high-quality data and have waited longer for the full payoff, will receive more revenues in the subsequent rounds. During the gradual payout of clients’ rewards, the notion of expectation fairness is used to ensure that the clients’ regret values are reduced as equitably as possible in lieu of their contributions.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another category of FL incentive mechanisms is not based on monetary rewards. Instead, they seek to motivate clients by assigning them FL models with different performances based on their contributions. These approaches are suitable for application scenarios in which 1) a monetary incentive budget is not available, 2) leveraging future revenues generated by the FL model to reward the clients is not feasible, or 3) there is competition among FL clients which causes high contribution clients to feel unfairly treated if they receive the same FL model as low contribution clients (i.e., the free-rider problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>).</p>

HFFL ensures fairness among the clients by providing the clients with higher-quality data with higher quality model updates. HFFL first classifies the clients into different levels based on their characteristics (e.g., data quality, data size). Then, it trains multiple FL models - one for each level. To train a lower-level model, clients from higher levels only contribute the same amount of data as those from lower levels. On the other hand, clients from lower levels are required to contribute all their local data when collaboratively training a higher-level FL model. As a result, clients at higher levels receive FL models with better performance. However, HFFL has several shortcomings. Firstly, the clients at the same level may not have the same amount of data since additional factors are being considered when categorizing clients. Secondly, some of the client characteristics used for categorizing clients are obtained through self-reporting, which makes the approach susceptible to fake reporting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to HFFL, which divides all the clients into different clusters and trains one model for each cluster, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a decentralized Fair and Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning (FPPDL) framework in which each participant receives a different variant of the final FL model based on his contribution. In FPPDL, each participant earns a certain number of transaction points based on their local credibility and commitment level. The local credibility system is maintained by mutual evaluation between any two participants. Then, participants can use their transaction points to download gradients from other participants. As a result, each participant can obtain an improved local model compared to their standalone models without collaboration, and the improvement gained by each participant is proportional to his corresponding contribution. Moreover, FPPDL also preserves data privacy by incorporating Differentially Private GAN (DPGAN) and a three-lay onion-style encryption scheme.
Nevertheless, the current approaches still lack precision control when it comes to constructing a machine learning model with a specific level of performance.</p>

Some research works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> use the standard deviation of performance across different devices to measure fairness. Since both standard deviation and AV share the same idea of reflecting the variability in distribution (i.e., standard deviation is the square root of AV), we also include these works in this section.</p>

JRI is more advantageous compared to the aforementioned metrics, which can only measure the relative fairness of different FL approaches, but not how close they are to absolute fairness.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FAFL research is still in its infancy. Much research is still needed to strike a balance between FL server and the FL client interests.
In Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V FAFL Evaluation Metrics ‣ Towards Fairness-Aware Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we summarize the proposed taxonomy together with the assumptions, notions of fairness and fairness evaluation metrics our review has uncovered. It can be observed that the fundamental assumptions (A1–A2) are adopted in most FAFL approaches. For simplifying assumptions, the FL incentive mechanism research commonly rejects assumption B3 (i.e., data owners always agree to join FL when invited). Assumption B5 (i.e., a client dedicates all its resources to a given FL training task) is being relaxed in client customization research under FAFL. In the Non-Monetary Incentive Mechanism domain, there are works starting to emerge that relax assumption B7 (i.e., monopoly market structure). Among the notions of fairness, notion F5 (i.e., contribution fairness) is most widely adopted in contribution evaluation and incentive mechanism research. Notion F1 (i.e., performance distribution fairness) is commonly adopted in model optimization research, while notion F4 (i.e., selection fairness) is widely adopted in client selection research. Nevertheless, these notions of fairness are not jointly addressed in any one approach. There is a diversity of opinions among researchers in this area. One important finding in the usage of evaluation metrics is that the most relevant evaluation metric - Jain’s Fairness Index (metric E4) - is capable of evaluating diverse notions of fairness. While most works focused on applying JFI to Notion F1 (i.e., performance distribution fairness), future work can further adopt JFI to evaluate other fairness notions. In addition to the aforementioned potential areas of improvement, we highlight six promising future research directions in FAFL.</p>

In scenarios where the incentive for FL participants comes from future revenues generated by the resulting models, FL clients’ waiting time for receiving the full payoff needs to be accounted for fair treatment. These temporal costs incurred by FL participants need to be taken into account when designing holistic FL contribution evaluation schemes.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In current FL incentive mechanism design research, most works assume a monopoly market setting consisting of only one FL task publisher and multiple FL clients. The task publisher distributes the rewards to the clients to incentivize them to participate in the federated model training. Under this assumption, the single task publisher faces no competition (i.e., clients can only choose to join this federation or not with no other alternatives). Such an assumption is not realistic and hinders the development of more FAFL incentive schemes.
A non-monopoly market setting deserves further study as it involves many task publishers. The task publishers compete with each other to attract more clients. In such a scenario, a task publisher faces stronger pressure to provide more reasonable rewards to motivate clients to join federated training. This may inspire fairer FL incentive schemes to emerge.</p>

However, in reality, there exist malicious clients who might tamper with the gradients and other information they pass to the FL server. This can severely degrade model performance. Although there have been works focusing on defending against privacy attacks, they generally overlook fairness. For example, some methods may filter out rare but informative updates from clients with minority classes, leading to unfair treatment of such clients and potentially biased FL models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite>. Hence, more work is needed to study attacks and defense models to design robust approaches towards fairness in FL. One potential direction is to establish a penalty system to deter misbehaving clients. For example, Stackelberg game-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> can be leveraged to dynamically inspect client local model updates for potential attacks and design corresponding punitive measures. The key is to ensure that the expected utility gain from an attack is negative so as to deter any rational attacker.</p>

Such uncertainty might hamper some clients’ future decisions on joining FL. The goal of building explainability is to provide a global understanding on how the FL server makes decisions and how they impact each client’s interest in order to build trust between the two parties.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we provided a comprehensive review of FAFL approaches. We summarized the common assumptions and main notions of fairness adopted in existing FL approaches. We proposed a new taxonomy of FAFL based on the major steps involved in FL, and summarized the challenges faced in each step. After a review of the current studies, we discussed the main evaluation metrics adopted to experimentally measure the performance of FAFL algorithms in order to support long-term sustainability of this field. Finally, we suggest some promising future research directions that can help enhance fairness of future FL approaches. For an interdisciplinary field such as FAFL, collaboration among researchers and industry practitioners from various fields is essential for progress. We hope that this first-of-its-kind survey on FAFL will serve as a useful roadmap towards building FAFL systems.</p>
