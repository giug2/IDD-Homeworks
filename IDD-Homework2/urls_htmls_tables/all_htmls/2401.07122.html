<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables wireless terminals to collaboratively learn a shared parameter model while keeping all the training data on devices per se. Parameter sharing consists of synchronous and asynchronous ways: the former transmits parameters as blocks or frames and waits until all transmissions finish, whereas the latter provides messages about the status of pending and failed parameter transmission requests. Whatever synchronous or asynchronous parameter sharing is applied, the learning model shall adapt to distinct network architectures as an improper learning model will deteriorate learning performance and, even worse, lead to model divergence for the asynchronous transmission in resource-limited large-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper proposes a decentralized learning model and develops an asynchronous parameter-sharing algorithm for resource-limited distributed IoT networks. This decentralized learning model approaches a convex function as the number of nodes increases, and its learning process converges to a global stationary point with a higher probability than the centralized FL model. Moreover, by jointly accounting for the convergence bound of federated learning and the transmission delay of wireless communications, we develop a node scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm to minimize the transmission delay. Extensive simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the distributed algorithm in terms of fast learning model convergence and low transmission delay.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The phenomenal development of wireless networking technologies yields a volume of various sensory data, such as traffic information and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data. As massive amounts of data are typically required to train a machine learning (ML) model, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNN), traditional ML algorithms must gather training data from edge devices. Moreover, to realize data sharing, it is essential to transmit a large dataset to an edge server for training ML models. However, limited communication resources for data transmission and conveying large volumes of data by edge devices may substantially burden wireless communications, regardless of privacy constraints. Therefore, edge learning has been proposed to train local models over distributed edge nodes, allowing edge nodes to contribute to the learning procedure for consensus without any raw data exchange. More specifically, federated learning (FL) is, in essence, collaborative edge learning, which deploys large data over multiple edge nodes and then collaborates in training local models without sharing their possibly private data. Moreover, various network architectures regarding computational models and communication mechanisms exist to realize efficient computation and reliable communications.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From the perceptive of computational models, there are two main categories: centralized and decentralized, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I-A Related Works and Motivation ‣ I Introduction ‣ Decentralized Federated Learning with Asynchronous Parameter Sharing for Large-scale IoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Specifically, the federated averaging model is a typical centralized model with a central server to orchestrate a training process, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ I-A Related Works and Motivation ‣ I Introduction ‣ Decentralized Federated Learning with Asynchronous Parameter Sharing for Large-scale IoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1a</span></a>. After receiving local models from the participating nodes, the central server is responsible for parameter aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, the centralized model requires massive communications between the edge server and nodes, which is usually not feasible. To deal with this infeasibility, decentralized FL models have recently emerged to significantly reduce the transmission delay because all nodes only communicate with their neighbors, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ I-A Related Works and Motivation ‣ I Introduction ‣ Decentralized Federated Learning with Asynchronous Parameter Sharing for Large-scale IoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1b</span></a>. For example, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> optimizes the linking weights of peer-to-peer communications to realize efficient communication in the decentralized scheme. The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> exploits the cross gradients and develops a novel decentralized learning algorithm, which reduces the communication cost and maintains a satisfactory learning performance for various data distributions.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the perceptive of communication mechanisms, there are synchronous transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and asynchronous transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. For a synchronous scheme, the server cannot aggregate local models until participating nodes finish uploading their local models. Specifically, the works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> adopt synchronous FL architectures to balance resource budget and learning accuracy adaptively. By using dynamic aggregation frequency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> or node scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, these architectures could address resource-limited problems in the learning process. Nevertheless, while multiple nodes have extensive data for model training or suffer from high transmission delays, synchronous schemes must wait for uploading models. Moreover, the waiting time leads to idling and wastage of computational resources. To address these issues, asynchronous schemes are proposed. The works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> design asynchronous FL systems to reduce transmission delay. However, these asynchronous schemes may yield objective inconsistency, i.e., the learning model may be far from the desired one. The inconsistency between local and global models potentially deteriorates convergence and, even worse, leads to model divergence as the number of iterations increases. In addition, asynchronous schemes often lack theoretical identifications to guarantee convergence, particularly for non-convex FL models.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">From the perspective of wireless resource allocation, many works have been on designing communication-efficient FL algorithms that enable edge nodes to efficiently train and transmit model parameters and significantly improve learning performance and convergence rate. For instance, the works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> focus on joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm designs while guaranteeing learning performance. To characterize the theoretical relations between the number of communication rounds and learning performance, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> made a tradeoff for joint optimization, including communication latencies and energy consumption. Hence, realizing efficient communication and minimizing transmission delay is essential for distributed algorithms in large-scale IoT networks.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This paper develops a decentralized FL model with asynchronous parameter sharing to address the abovementioned issues. In particular, the proposed model has multi-branch architectures and allows various learning parameters at each node, forming a sum of multi-branch non-convex functions. By recalling the Shapley-Folkman lemma <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a sum of multi-branch non-convex functions can approach a convex function when the number of branches becomes large. Thus, the decentralized FL model is less non-convex, and its learning process converges to a global stationary point with a higher probability than the centralized FL model. In addition, when the dataset is uniformly deployed over each node, and the size of the dataset becomes large, the learning performance and convergence rate of training algorithms improve with the number of distributed nodes increases.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>In principle, the assumption requires that the data distribution at each node is identical to the distribution of the total dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which is unfortunately hard to satisfy in real-world applications. To address this issue, the cross-gradient aggregation (CGA) algorithm is widely used in simulation experiments to approach the distribution of the total dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span> On the one hand, the asynchronous parameter-sharing mechanism makes the learning and parameter transmission occur in parallel. Thus, a high learning efficiency can be obtained compared with a synchronous architecture. On the other hand, designing a decentralized FL model at the distributed nodes requires an efficient communication network that balances learning performance maximization and transmission delay minimization. In this regard, the asynchronous parameter-sharing method is adopted among distributed nodes. Accordingly, we derive a convergence bound incorporating transmission delay and learning performance. In light of the convergence bound and aggregated duration, we also develop algorithms regarding node scheduling and bandwidth allocation to minimize the transmission delay while maximizing the learning performance.

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper starts to develop a decentralized FL model with non-convex loss functions. Then, we characterize the duality gap of the decentralized FL model by using the seminal Shapley-Folkman lemma. Next, we design a distributed algorithm with asynchronous parameter sharing and derive its convergence bound, where the transmission delay is associated with the convergence bound. At last, we design a node scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm to minimize the transmission delay. In brief, the major contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Now, we characterize the convergence for the distributed algorithm with asynchronous parameter sharing. Compared with traditional convergence analysis, it is hard to prove the convergence of our proposed algorithm due to shared and local learning parameters. To address this issue, this paper designs a new loss function that mitigates the influence of shared parameters and establishes the convergence relationship. First, we define this loss function as</p>

The network coverage area is tessellated into Voronoi cells using the nearest-neighbor association criteria, i.e., each node is associated with its nearest base station (BS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. We assume that the locations of user nodes follow a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) with a pre-defined spatial density. A fixed amount of spectrum resource is divided into multiple spectrum bands for efficient spectral utilization. Each node with a single antenna broadcasts the same parameters to others through its allocated spectrum band. A block-fading propagation model is adopted, where the channels between any two nodes are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and keep quasi-static in the parameter transmission period. In addition, the propagation channels are supposed to be narrow-band (which is true in IoT applications), and large-scale path loss and small-scale fading are accounted for as usual.</p>

The reason stems from the fact that Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ V-B Bandwidth Allocation ‣ V Wireless Resource Allocation ‣ Decentralized Federated Learning with Asynchronous Parameter Sharing for Large-scale IoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> can allocate bandwidth optimally such that the transmission delay and aggregated duration can also be minimized.

However, the random and uniform bandwidth allocations are not optimal, thus resulting in a longer transmission delay and aggregated duration than Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ V-B Bandwidth Allocation ‣ V Wireless Resource Allocation ‣ Decentralized Federated Learning with Asynchronous Parameter Sharing for Large-scale IoT Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

The reason is that the FedAP algorithm only schedules partial nodes for the global aggregation and has data deficiency due to the communication stragglers.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has developed a decentralized FL model with less non-convex summation functions to adapt to distributed network architecture, especially for resource-constrained large-scale IoT networks. With the increasing number of nodes, this paper has derived a duality gap to control the non-convexity of our proposed decentralized FL model and improve the learning performance. To realize efficient learning, this paper has also proposed a gradient descent algorithm with asynchronous parameter sharing and a convergence analysis to mitigate the influence of stochastic transmission delays. Moreover, we established the relationship between the convergence bound and the transmission delay for efficient communication and excellent learning performance in resource-constrained IoT networks. It improved the learning performance by minimizing the transmission delay. In future works, we will incorporate the data distribution divergence over nodes and design a new gradient descent to deal with insufficient data samples.</p>
