<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is a rapidly growing area of research and with various benefits and industry applications. Typical federated patterns have some intrinsic issues such as heavy server traffic, long periods of convergence, and unreliable accuracy. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing asynchronous hierarchical federated learning, in which the central server uses either the network topology or some clustering algorithm to assign clusters for workers (i.e., client devices). In each cluster, a special aggregator device is selected to enable hierarchical learning, leads to efficient communication between server and workers, so that the burden of the server can be significantly reduced. In addition, asynchronous federated learning schema is used to tolerate heterogeneity of the system and achieve fast convergence, i.e., the server aggregates the gradients from the workers weighted by a staleness parameter to update the global model, and regularized stochastic gradient descent is performed in workers, so that the instability of asynchronous learning can be alleviated. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on CIFAR-10 image classification task, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of asynchronous hierarchical federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a machine learning methodology where the model updates happen in many clients (mobile devices, silos, etc.), as opposed to a more traditional setting, where training happens on a centralized server. This approach has many benefits, such as avoiding the upkeep of a centralized server, minimizing the network traffic between many clients and servers, as well as keeping sensitive user data anonymous and private.
For cross-device Federated Learning, the most common architecture pattern is a centralized topology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">2</span></a>]</cite>. This topology has been a popular area of research, and has seen much success when applied to commercial products. However, the centralized topology introduces some challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We are learning from the tradeoffs presented by the comparison of certain topologies and help us focus on which tradeoffs we want to measure specifically.
In a centralized network topology, a central server is where all the training happens. However, in some scenarios, a central server may not always be desirable; or the central may not be powerful enough <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">26</span></a>]</cite>. The central server could also become a bottleneck for large amount of network traffic, and large number of connections. This bottleneck is exacerbated when the federated networks are composed of a massive number of devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">15</span></a>]</cite>. Furthermore, current Federated Learning algorithms, such as Federated Averaging, can only efficiently utilize hundreds of devices in each training round, but many more are available <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">1</span></a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One approach that attempted to address these challenges is decentralized training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">2</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">15</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">24</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">26</span></a>]</cite>. However, in large scale FL systems, a fully decentralized FL topology is inefficient, since the convergence time could be long, and the traffic between devices could be too intensive. Well-connected or denser networks encourage faster consensus and give better theoretical convergence rates, which depend on the spectral gap of the network graph. However, when data is IID, sparser topologies do not necessarily hurt the convergence in practice. Denser networks typically incur communication delays which increase with the node degrees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">11</span></a>]</cite>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The most widely used and straightforward algorithm to aggregate the local models is to take the average, proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite> and known as Federated Averaging (<span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>).
In FL, the communication cost often dominates the computation cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite>, thus is one of the key issues we need to resolve for implementing FL system at scale. In particular, the state-of-the-art deep learning models are designed to achieve higher prediction performance at the cost of increasing model complexity with millions or even billions of parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">7</span></a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">4</span></a>]</cite>. On the other hand, FL requires frequent communication of the models between the server and workers. As such, <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite> encourages each worker to perform more iterations of local updates before communicating during global aggregation, this results in significantly less communication rounds, and also increases the accuracy eventually as model averaging produces regularization effect. Another way to decrease the communication cost is to reduce the size of model information that needs to be sent, either through model compression techniques such as sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">22</span></a>]</cite> and quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">5</span></a>]</cite>, or only select a small portion of important gradients to be communicated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">25</span></a>]</cite> based on the observation that most of deep learning model parameters are closed to zero <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">23</span></a>]</cite>. However, these methods may result in deterioration of model accuracy, or incur high computation cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">16</span></a>]</cite>. Alternatively, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">17</span></a>]</cite> proposed client-edge-cloud hierarchical federated learning (<span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HierFAVG</span>), an edge computing paradigm in which the edge servers play the roles of intermediate parameter aggregators. The hierarchical FL algorithm leverages on the proximity of edge servers, significantly relieves the burden of the central server on remote cloud.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">28</span></a>]</cite> introduces a hierarchical federated learning protocol through LAN-WAN orchestration, which involves a hierarchical aggregation mechanism in the local-area network (LAN) due to its abundant bandwidth and almost negligible monetary cost than WAN, and incorporates cloud-device aggregation architecture, intra-LAN peer-to-peer (p2p) topology generation, inter-LAN bandwidth capacity heterogeneity.
While the hierarchical learning pattern is promising to reduce communication, it is not applicable to all networks, as the physical hierarchy may not exist or be known <span id="S2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a priori</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">13</span></a>]</cite>.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">21</span></a>]</cite> designs and implements Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) using a cosine-similarity-based clustering method that creates a bi-partitioning to group client devices with the same data generating distribution into the same cluster. Client devices are clustered into different groups according to their properties. It has better performance for the non-IID-severe client network, without accessing the local data.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">3</span></a>]</cite> implemented a hierarchical clustering step (FL+HC) to separate clusters of clients by the similarity of their local updates to the global joint model. Once separated, the clusters are trained independently and in parallel on specialised models.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">19</span></a>]</cite>, a self-organizing hierarchical structured FL mechanism is implemented based on democratized learning, agglomerative clustering, and hierarchical generalization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the current FL systems are implemented using synchronous update, which is susceptible to the straggler effect. To address this problem, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">27</span></a>]</cite> proposed an asynchronous algorithm for federated optimization, <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAsync</span>, which solves regularized local problems and then uses a weighted average with respect to the staleness to update the global model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">6</span></a>]</cite> presented <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ASO-Fed</span> for asynchronous online FL, which uses the same surrogate objective for local updates, while the local learning rate is adaptive to the average time cost of past iterations. This type of surrogate of adding such a proximal term for local updates was introduced in <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">14</span></a>]</cite>, which mainly aimed to address the problem of system heterogeneity, yet it turns out the similar idea can be adopted well to asynchronous federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There also exist several work that focused on decentralized solutions. Gossip learning is a decentralized alternative to federated learning. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">10</span></a>]</cite> adopted gossip learning without aggregation servers nor a central component. Knowing that peer-to-peer bandwidth is much smaller than the worker’s maximum network capacity, the system could fully utilize the bandwidth by saturating the network with segmented gossip aggregation and the experiments showed that the training time can be reduced significantly with great convergence performance.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">9</span></a>]</cite> presents a thorough comparison of Centralized Federated Learning and Gossip Learning. Examine the aggregated cost of machine learning in both cases, considering also a compression technique applicable in both approaches.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">12</span></a>]</cite> presents a peer-to-peer Federated Learning on graphs, which is a distributed learning algorithm in which nodes update their belief by judicially aggregating information from their local observational data with the model of their one-hop neighbors to collectively learn a model that best fits the observations over the entire network.
Coral is a peer-to-peer self-organizing content distribution system introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">8</span></a>]</cite>. Coral creates self-organizing clusters of nodes that fetch information from each other to avoid communicating with more distant or heavily-loaded servers.
As a peer-to-peer FL framework particularly targeted towards medical applications, BrainTorrent introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite> presents a highly dynamic peer-to-peer environment, where all centers directly interact with each other without depending on a central body.</p>

In addition, given the network information of all client devices, we allow the central server to be responsible for the knowledge of the hierarchical communication topology.
In the case of mobile edge computing, the partition and hierarchy can be naturally formed by the communication edges, as the links between the central server with the edge servers or base stations form a star topology, and so do the links between each edge server with the devices. We extend this architecture to a more general case by allowing the central server to run clustering algorithm to assign which cluster each device belongs to, as well as a special device in each cluster, which we denote as the “<span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aggregator</span>”, that plays the role of an edge server, that is, provides inter-hierarchy communication including downlink transmission from the central server and client devices and uplink transmission from the clients to the central server, also aggregates information to reduce the necessary communication. In FL, this aggregation work is specific to aggregating of the clients’ updated weights/gradients, and sending them to the central server. The downlink transmission is straightforward: the server periodically sends the global model with timestamp as well as the hyperparameters for the learning task to the aggregators, and the aggregator serves as the parent node of the client devices in each cluster, forwards the information it receives from the central server to its children nodes.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">On an aggregator, the rate of receiving updates from the clients may vary caused by several reasons, such as heterogeneity of the computation power among devices, network delay, etc. We propose to perform asynchronous federated learning, that is, the aggregator immediately aggregates the update from the clients and reports to the central server. In real implementation, we can use a thread-safe FIFO queue to store the updates from the clients inside each aggregator, and periodically aggregates the results in the queue without waiting for that from some potential stragglers. This is different from the synchronous FL paradigm, and the uplink communication is then non-blocking.

Note that this weighting mechanism makes sense if the data are i.i.d. over the clients. However, the bias could be severe if non-i.i.d. data are involved, as the mechanism favors learning for faster computed and communicated devices, in which case we need to carefully tune and design a more complicated weighting mechanism. The central server updates the global model as follows:</p>

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In each setting, we let the learning last for 2500 learning epochs with a clock in the central server. Specifically, each learning epoch is synchronized among all devices. We simulate asynchronous learning system by assuming the fault (e.g. device down, communication loss, straggler effect, etc.) uniformly distributed with probability 0.1 among all non-server devices for each learning epoch. This probability distribution can be further investigated by tuning the parameters and looking at empirical studies. Note that this setting of fault is not introduced into the synchronous learning systems, otherwise a faulty device or network partition may cause the systems to wait forever by their synchronous nature. This in turn demonstrates the advantage of fault tolerance with asynchronous learning.</p>

<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">According to Figure <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4 Experiments and Results ‣ Asynchronous Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, with hierarchical settings, the complexity of learning system is greatly increased, as a result, the <span id="S4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HierFedAvg</span> algorithm not only converges the slowest, the learning is also not stable. Conversely, it is obvious that our designed <span id="S4.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HierFedAsync</span> algorithm overcomes the issues brought by the hierarchical setting.
Although <span id="S4.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> seems to perform the best when the number of client devices is small (e.g., when there are 10 clients in the system), we would like to emphasize again that we did not count the fault device nor the stragglers’ effect in the synchronous settings for our experiments, while those effects are included in our asynchronous settings. Even so, our <span id="S4.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HierFedAsync</span> algorithm performs close to the best in all cases, and when the system gets larger, the advantages of <span id="S4.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HierFedAsync</span> gets more obvious, not only shows faster convergence especially early on, also leads to higher test accuracy.

In a large system of network topology, this could also leads to less packet loss, more effective communication and computation.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose asynchronous hierarchical federated learning.
As federated networks are composed of a massive number of devices, communication is a critical challenge in FL. We tackle this problem by exploring different architectural patterns for the design of FL systems. The tradeoff of central and fully decentralized learning on the complexity of the system as well as the learning effectiveness, computational and communication cost is obvious. We deploy a FL system with a central server, but with hierarchical topology. In this paper, we combine asynchronous FL and hierarchical FL into our <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAH</span> algorithm. In addition, we blur the concept of network topological edges to form clusters as well as the hierarchical structures. We aim at reducing the communication load between devices and the server in FL system, also improve flexibility and scalability. Our initial experiments demonstrated that combining asynchronous FL and hierarchical FL not only leads to faster convergence, tolerates heterogeneity of the system such as the faulty devices, straggler effect, etc., also significantly alleviates the communication burden on the central server. However, the asynchronous and hierarchical nature greatly increases the complexity of the system, especially on the communication topology, which could lead to unstable learning.
We explored the literature and recent research advances, combine them into our proposed method, <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAH</span>, which inherits the merits of both asynchronous and hierarchical FL, meanwhile significantly mitigates the instability with the utilization of staleness function and cluster weighting on the central server and edge devices, as well as adding regularization for local updates on client devices. We implemented the system and evaluated on CIFAR-10 image classification task, the results verify the effectiveness of our design and meet our expectation.
There are several interesting directions to pursue for the future of this paper. First off, as we mentioned in the paper, our weighting mechanism for aggregation favors learning for faster computed and communicated devices, which works fine if the data are i.i.d. over the clients. We need to design a more sophisticated weighting mechanism for asynchronous FL if non-i.i.d. data are involved.
The second interesting direction in which to take this paper would be modification of the simple <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="L^{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">L</mi><mn id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐿</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">L^{2}</annotation></semantics></math>-regularization on local clients’ learning.
We also need to finish the derivation and proof of the theoretical analysis.
In addition, more experiments need to be conducted on different datasets and tasks.
Furthermore, we need to bring more sophisticated experimental settings for the simulation, for instance, the straggler effect should be emphasized.</p>
