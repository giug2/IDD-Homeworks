<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) helps disaggregate the household’s main electricity consumption to energy usages of individual appliances, thus greatly cutting down the cost in fine-grained household load monitoring. To address the arisen privacy concern in NILM applications, federated learning (FL) could be leveraged for NILM model training and sharing. When applying the FL paradigm in real-world NILM applications, however, we are faced with the challenges of edge resource restriction, edge model personalization and edge training data scarcity.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">In this paper we present FedNILM, a practical FL paradigm for NILM applications at the edge client. Specifically, FedNILM is designed to deliver privacy-preserving and personalized NILM services to large-scale edge clients, by leveraging i) secure data aggregation through federated learning, ii) efficient cloud model compression via filter pruning and multi-task learning, and iii) personalized edge model building with unsupervised transfer learning. Our experiments on real-world energy data show that, FedNILM is able to achieve personalized energy disaggregation with the state-of-the-art accuracy, while ensuring privacy preserving at the edge client.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Non-intrusive load monitoring, also known as energy disaggregation, was first proposed by Hart in 1992 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. It is a single-channel blind source separation (BSS) problem that aims to decompose the aggregated power readings of a household into appliance-wise power consumption. One of the major purposes of NILM is to help reduce household energy consumption efficiently. Evidences have shown that such feedback of itemized information could encourage householders to use energy in a more sustainable way, achieving about <math id="S1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="15\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">15</mn><mo id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">15</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1c">15\%</annotation></semantics></math> energy saving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Besides, NILM can be leveraged to evaluate conservation programs, improve the quality of load forecasting, and provide references for power grid management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. For example, with real-time NILM applications, utility companies could suggest switching operations on particular appliances (e.g., air conditioners) for load shifting in peak power hours <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although proposed for decades, the NILM problem has not been addressed completely, and traditional solutions referring to man-made appliance signatures have run into bottlenecks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Most recently, it shows that the deep neural network (DNN) based approaches could greatly improve the performance of NILM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, as neural networks are able to automatically learn appliance features (or <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">appliance signatures</em>), either obvious or latent ones. Various neural network architectures have been proposed for NILM, including denoising auto-encoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, recurrent neural networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, etc. Among those DNN based methods, the <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Seq2Point</em> model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, a one-dimensional CNN based auto-encoder architecture, is the current state-of-the-art model for energy disaggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Arguably, the DNN based NILM models largely rely on sufficient and diverse training data, whereas realistic datasets often exist in the form of isolated islands. Although there are plenty of meter data in different buildings, it is almost impossible to transmit or integrate these local user data into a centralized storage, due to limits in communication bandwidth and legislation in user privacy and data security. Actually, in the last few years, the emphasis on data security and user privacy has become a global issue. For example, in the United States, China, and the European Union, relevant regulations have been enforced to protect data security and privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, making it high-risk to gather massive user energy consumption data. In consequence, it is impractical to train powerful NILM models with existing paradigms.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address such problems, federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. In a canonical FL system, user data is kept on client devices and the NILM model training is realized by i) local model updates with users’ own data and ii) cloud model fusion with all users’ models. In this way, client data remains locally and separate clients are integrated to build a up-to-date cloud model, thus allowing local models to collectively reap the benefits of cloud model trained from rich data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. It seems natural to apply the FL paradigm to the NILM problem for privacy preserving, which was theoretically verified in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> recently. When dealing with real-world NILM applications at local houses, however, we are still faced with the following major challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenge 1:</span> One critical limitation of adopting the typical FL system to NILM applications is the constrained resource in local homes (or <em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">edge clients</em>), in terms of computation power, communication bandwidth, memory and storage size, etc. In reality, usually low-end devices (or <em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">edge devices</em>) appear in local homes, rather than those powerful CPU/GPU servers. Hence, as the NILM models usually take large memory and computation overheads, network training on such resource-constrained edge devices could take prohibitively long time or even be terminated immediately. Since we cannot perform the model fusion at cloud without local updates, the resource lack at the edge client literally hinders the FL paradigm from applying in NILM applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenge 2:</span> The second one relates to the personalization of NILM models. Although recent DNN based approaches are promising for NILM, it is not clear whether existing models are transferable among the diverse edge clients, since most of the models are trained on public datasets (e.g., REDD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and UK-DALE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>). In other words, even with satisfied performance on the common training datasets (or <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">source domain</em>), these models may perform badly in a testing house (or <em id="S1.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">target domain</em>), owing to the distribution difference between training and testing data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Generally speaking, different households usually have different appliances as well as energy usage patterns, making those models hardly capture edge clients’ heterogeneity and resulting in poor scalability in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenge 3:</span> The third one is on training data scarcity at edge clients. For NILM applications, obtaining unlabelled testing data (i.e., mains power data) is quite easy, as current utility smart meters report the whole-home energy consumption periodically. To acquire labelled training data (i.e., power consumption data of individual appliances), however, is extremely expensive if not impossible. Although there are various power sensing devices and we could equip each appliance with a power sensor, this would incur enormous installation and maintenance costs, and thus is unscalable across large-scale households. As current DNN based NILM models are generally trained from large amounts of labelled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the scarcity of training data further limits the scalability of NILM systems and applications.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the resource limitation at the edge client (Challenge 1), our idea is to compress the complex NILM model to a simpler one that the edge device can afford. More specifically, the cloud NILM model under the FL paradigm could be pruned before being circulated to edge clients, and thus the edge devices would be able to implement local computation based on the compressed global state. Besides, a compressed NILM model is also desirable for cloud-edge communications. Then, to build personalized NILM models for diverse edge clients (Challenge 2), particularly under the condition of training data scarcity (Challenge 3), we propose to leverage the unsupervised transfer learning. By aligning the feature map distributions between the source and target domains, the unsupervised transfer learning techniques (e.g., CORAL in Sec. <a href="#S6.SS2" title="VI-B Correlation Alignment ‣ VI Client Model Personalization ‣ FedNILM: Applying Federated Learning to NILM Applications at the Edge" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">VI-B</span></span></a>) could be incorporated with existing NILM modelling process, and properly address the domain shift issue for NILM model personalization.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The first challenge is how to perform DNN-based NILM model inference at edge clients where only resource constrained devices could be installed. Deploying compressed NILM models on edge devices might be a promising approach. It has been demonstrated that model compression may not do harm to the NILM performance while significantly reducing the computational overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The other challenge is on the degradation of the cloud model at the edge client. When applying the FL paradigm for NILM, the same model trained at the cloud would be delivered to various client ends. When the distributions between the client data and the cloud data are different, which is the most likely case, we would see more or less performance degradation from the NILM model at the client.</p>

Both ATL and CTL freeze the convolutional layers and merely tune the fully connected layers during retraining. Recently, apart from the canonical CNN structure, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> develop the TrGAN-NILM, which is based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs), to automatically extract common feature representations between source and target domains through minimizing the statistical distance between different domains.</p>

Intuitively, leveraging excess information that comes from auxiliary tasks enables the MTL model to perform well in main task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. By leveraging MTL techniques in the Seq2Point modeling (we name the variant <em id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">MTL-Seq2Point</em>), we are able to train one single model for all target appliances for NILM applications. This can significantly reduce the resource overhead at the edge device.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the multi-task learning, we also seek other effective techniques to further compress the NILM model in compatible with the less powerful edge devices. There has been some progress recently towards this direction, including weights pruning, filter pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, neuron pruning and tensor decomposition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.

Thus, the common model can perform very well upon the cloud dataset, while may be greatly degraded at different client ends. To this end, we leverage the transfer learning technique and build personalized models for different clients. Particularly, we adopt the unsupervised transfer learning to work with unlabelled client data, hence addressing the training data scarcity problem at the edge client.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Correlation alignment (CORAL) is an instrumental domain adaptation method, which tackles the domain shift via aligning the feature distributions of source and target samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. More specifically, deep CORAL aligns the source and target data distributions through learning a nonlinear transformation, i.e., a differentiable loss function (CORAL loss), between source and target layer activations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. This nonlinear transformation is designed to minimize the distance between the second-order statistics (covariance) of the source and domain layer features.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At the cloud end, we train the Seq2Point model with/without pruning and MTL on the REDD dataset, and compare the NILM performance, run-time and memory overhead from different model adoptions. To show the impacts of model compression, we prune the parameters of Seq2Point and MTL-Seq2Point by 30%, 60% and 90%, respectively. The results are summarized in Table <a href="#S7.T1" title="Table I ‣ VII-A3 Performance Metrics ‣ VII-A Experimental Settings ‣ VII Experiments ‣ FedNILM: Applying Federated Learning to NILM Applications at the Edge" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> and Table <a href="#S7.T2" title="Table II ‣ VII-A3 Performance Metrics ‣ VII-A Experimental Settings ‣ VII Experiments ‣ FedNILM: Applying Federated Learning to NILM Applications at the Edge" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, for input sequence lengths of 499 and 99, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the experimental results in Table <a href="#S7.T1" title="Table I ‣ VII-A3 Performance Metrics ‣ VII-A Experimental Settings ‣ VII Experiments ‣ FedNILM: Applying Federated Learning to NILM Applications at the Edge" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> and Table <a href="#S7.T2" title="Table II ‣ VII-A3 Performance Metrics ‣ VII-A Experimental Settings ‣ VII Experiments ‣ FedNILM: Applying Federated Learning to NILM Applications at the Edge" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, we observe that both multi-task learning and filter pruning could significantly reduce the model size along with decent inference time benefits, without drastically compromising NILM performance. In particular, for the sequence 499, pruning 60% of filters on classical Seq2Point model can save approximately two-thirds of running time and reduce memory cost by up to 84% while retaining comparable prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-task learning structure virtually takes one fourth of the original computation and memory overhead, as it simultaneously generates the disaggregation results of four selected appliances. The combination of filter pruning and multi-task learning techniques could help save nearly 92% of inference time and 96% of model space with slight (&lt;10%) performance degradation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For sequence length 99, the unoptimised model occupies <math id="S7.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="6\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S7.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><mn id="S7.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1">6</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" id="S7.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.2">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">6\times</annotation></semantics></math> more space and requires more inference time than the optimised model pruned 60% of filters with similar performance. Same as we have found with the model of sequence length 499, for sequence length 99, the multi-task learning structure helps save nearly three fourths of running time and space, whereas filter pruning may not have much influence on inference time as the time required for these three pruned models with different pruning percentages are almost the same. Note that we merely prune the filters in convolutional layers and in a forward pass. The majority of computations takes place in fully connected layers, not convolutional layers, so the reduction of parameters in convolutional layers may not reduce much operations in inference procedure, thus explaining this phenomenon.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, the general NILM performance decreases with the increasing of pruning percentage, and the employment of multi-task learning structure also contribute to the ED performance degradation as all the four appliances use the same set of signatures for prediction. However, we also observe that in some circumstances, model pruning might rather give rise to better NILM results, such as the pruned Seq2Point model performance versus the original Seq2Point model accuracy on distinguishing the washing machine, which can be explained by “regularisation effect” as removing the least important weights from a neural network might lead to better model generalisation. In general, we choose to build our general cloud model based on Seq2Point model with multi-task learning and prune 60% of the filters in its convolutional layers.</p>

This implies that the convolutional layers virtually learn the generic features that are common in source and target domains, while the fully connected layers focus on extracting domain specific signatures. In other words, the number of transferred convolutional layers generally have little, if any, influence on the final prediction, while the more the dense layers we transfer the less the accuracy we get on the target domain.</p>

Then, to validate the effectiveness of transfer learning, we leverage the pre-trained cloud model to detect appliances in UK-DALE dataset. Arguably, the REDD is literally distinct from the UK-DALE, as the households in former dataset are located in the US while those in latter dataset are sited in the UK.</p>

In particular, for MAE, the performance is improved for all four appliances with transfer learning; for SAE, the accuracy is improved for three appliances; for F1-score, transfer learning model shows better performances on dish washer and microwave and comparable performance on fridge.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented FedNILM, a federated learning paradigm designed for privacy-preserving and personalized NILM applications at low-end edge devices. FedNILM realized data privacy-preserving through federated learning, efficient model compression via filter pruning and multi-task learning, and personalized model building by unsupervised transfer learning, respectively. The results from the experiments on real-world energy data demonstrate that, FedNILM can achieve accurate and personalized energy disaggregation without compromising the user privacy.</p>
