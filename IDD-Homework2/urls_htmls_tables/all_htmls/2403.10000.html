<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In the evolving landscape of Federated Learning (FL), the challenge of ensuring data integrity against poisoning attacks is paramount, particularly for applications demanding stringent privacy preservation. Traditional anomaly detection strategies often struggle to adapt to the distributed nature of FL, leaving a gap our research aims to bridge. We introduce a novel framework that synergizes gradient-based analysis with autoencoder-driven data reconstruction to detect and mitigate poisoned data with unprecedented precision. Our approach uniquely combines detecting anomalous gradient patterns with identifying reconstruction errors, significantly enhancing FL model security. Validated through extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, our method outperforms existing solutions by 15% in anomaly detection accuracy while maintaining a minimal false positive rate. This robust performance, consistent across varied data types and network sizes, underscores our framework’s potential in securing FL deployments in critical domains such as healthcare and finance. By setting new benchmarks for anomaly detection within FL, our work paves the way for future advancements in distributed learning security.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the evolving landscape of modern computing, the proliferation of edge computing devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) has precipitated a paradigm shift towards decentralized data generation and processing. This transformation necessitates the adoption of novel machine-learning paradigms that respect the privacy and bandwidth constraints intrinsic to distributed systems. Federated Learning (FL), initially conceived by McMahan et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, represents a groundbreaking stride toward collaborative intelligence. It enables myriad devices to contribute to constructing a communal model while keeping the data localized, thereby opening a new chapter in privacy-preserving machine learning and significantly reducing the bandwidth overhead associated with traditional centralized training techniques  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Motivation: Despite its transformative potential, FL inherently exhibits vulnerabilities to a spectrum of adversarial attacks, including, but not limited to, data poisoning and model tampering. These susceptibilities underscore an urgent need for robust defense mechanisms capable of safeguarding the federated model’s integrity without infringing upon the privacy of the participant entities. The complexity of securing FL is magnified by the distributed nature of its architecture, which introduces unique challenges such as data heterogeneity, communication inefficiencies, and the risk of isolation attacks  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The quest for a resilient FL framework is technical and strategic, necessitating solutions that are as dynamic and adaptable as the threats they contend with.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Current approaches to anomaly detection in FL, such as federated deep learning for cybersecurity and federated meta-learning, have begun to address some of these challenges. However, they often grapple with the robustness of FL under malicious attacks, inefficient communication, and the lack of personalization due to data heterogeneity and the scarcity of malicious samples  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. These limitations highlight the necessity for innovative solutions that are adaptive and comprehensive.</p>

The FL architecture inherently supports parallel processing across clients, enabling the system to handle increasing clients without significantly impacting the time complexity per round. The anomaly detection mechanism introduces a minimal computational overhead, ensuring the system remains efficient even as the network grows. Moreover, using autoencoders for anomaly detection does not significantly increase the space requirements, allowing for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure (8), for MNIST, the variation in gradient norms across different sensitivity factors highlighted the model’s learning dynamics. The higher norms suggest that the MNIST dataset, with its less complex images, results in sharper gradient updates. This implies that while the model can rapidly learn the distinctions between different digits, it may also be more sensitive to anomalous data, which is pivotal for anomaly detection algorithms. CIFAR-10’s gradient norms were lower and exhibited less variance compared to MNIST. This suggests that the CIFAR-10 dataset presents a smoother but potentially more challenging learning landscape with its more complex and diverse images. The model appears to be learning more gradually, which could affect its sensitivity to subtle anomalies.</p>

The errors were within an acceptable range, reflecting the autoencoder’s capability to capture the dataset’s underlying structure. This is vital for our approach since it underpins the reliability of the reconstruction error as a metric for anomaly detection within a federated. The CIFAR-10 dataset showed consistently low reconstruction errors, which could be attributed to the complexity of the images. It raises questions about the autoencoder’s sensitivity and the potential need for more sophisticated or tailored models for effective anomaly detection. This insight is crucial for enhancing our approach, ensuring that the reconstruction error remains a robust indicator of anomalies even in complex data distributions.</p>
