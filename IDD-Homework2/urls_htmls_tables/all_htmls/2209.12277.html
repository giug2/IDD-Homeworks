<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The conventional model aggregation-based federated learning (FL) approach requires all local models to have the same architecture, which fails to support practical scenarios with heterogeneous local models. Moreover, the frequent model exchange is costly for resource-limited wireless networks since modern deep neural networks usually have over a million parameters.
To tackle these challenges, we first propose a novel knowledge-aided FL (KFL) framework, which aggregates light high-level data features, namely knowledge, in the per-round learning process.
This framework allows devices to design their machine-learning models independently and reduces the communication overhead in the training process.
We then theoretically analyze the convergence bound of the proposed framework under a non-convex loss function setting, revealing that scheduling more data volume in each round helps to improve the learning performance.
In addition, large data volume should be scheduled in early rounds if the total scheduled data volume during the entire learning course is fixed.
Inspired by this, we define a new objective function, i.e., the weighted scheduled data sample volume, to transform the inexplicit global loss minimization problem into a tractable one for device scheduling, bandwidth allocation, and power control.
To deal with unknown time-varying wireless channels, we transform the considered problem into a deterministic problem for each round with the assistance of the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, we derive the optimal bandwidth allocation and power control solution by convex optimization techniques.
We also develop an efficient online device scheduling algorithm to achieve an energy-learning trade-off in the learning process.
Experimental results on two typical datasets (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10) under highly heterogeneous local data distributions show that the proposed KFL is capable of reducing over 99% communication overhead while achieving better learning performance than the conventional model aggregation-based algorithms. In addition, the proposed device scheduling algorithm converges faster than the benchmark scheduling schemes.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The increasing demands for intelligent services, such as augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, motivate the integration of machine learning in future wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Federated learning (FL) is one of the most promising distributed learning frameworks to reduce the communication traffic load of intelligent services, which enables devices to collaboratively train machine learning models by periodically exchanging model parameters between devices and the parameter server instead of raw user data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, the model aggregation nature of conventional FL confronts the following two limitations for its implementation in wireless networks:
1) <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">High Communication Overhead:</em> The uploading of model/gradient parameters is costly for devices since modern deep neural network (NN) architectures usually possess massive parameters. For instance, the widely used MobileNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, a convolutional NN (CNN) for on-device image processing, has 6.9 million parameters, corresponding to 27.6 MB.
Training such a model requires devices to upload 27.6 MB of data per round. Considering hundreds of rounds and multiple devices, the communication overhead is heavy for wireless networks with limited spectrum and energy resources.
2) <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Heterogeneous Local Models:</em> In practical wireless networks, devices are usually equipped with different NNs in terms of architectures and model sizes due to their heterogeneous computing capabilities and storage resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In this case, the traditional model aggregation-based FL approaches fail to coordinate devices to perform the learning process.
To break these two limitations, state-of-the-art studies focus on the designs of communication-efficient FL and heterogeneous FL.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enable communication-efficient FL in resource-limited wireless networks, existing works mainly focused on device scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, model quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and model pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Device scheduling methods select a small subset of devices to participate in the per-round training process, thus reducing the communication burden and mitigating the straggler effect when devices have random or heterogeneous computing speed.
The device selection and bandwidth allocation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> guaranteed long-term learning performance in bandwidth-limited wireless networks.
The probabilistic scheduling policy for FL proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> effectively minimized the model uploading latency and improved convergence speed.
The co-design of learning and device selection in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> reduced convergence time in resource-constrained wireless networks. Although these device scheduling approaches efficiently alleviate communication burden, transmitting the entire model is arduous for devices with weak channels and limited energy.
To tackle this issue, the model quantization compresses devices’ model updates before transmitting to the parameter server, thus reducing the transmitted data volume and communication overhead for devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, the model quantization approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> enabled edge devices to adjust their quantization proportional according to their communication resources for balancing training accuracy and communication overhead.
The heterogeneous quantization method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> allocated different aggregation weights to clients for efficiently improving convergence speed.
While the model quantization is demonstrably effective, it introduces additional noise during training, which ultimately degrading the trained model’s performance.
The model pruning is able to simultaneously reduce communication and computation costs by removing less important weights from the original model.
The joint design of the pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> significantly improved the convergence rate of FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the NN pruning was integrated into FL to improve learning speed and guarantee training latency.
A random model pruning approach was adopted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to generate several subnets from the global model to adapt the channel condition of different devices. It reduced both communication overhead and computation loads.
The above three approaches reduce communication overhead while degrading the final model’s accuracy.
Besides these approaches, our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> enabled devices to train the feature extractor part of NNs collaboratively, while the predictor part for devices is localized for personalization. It reduced communication overhead and improved learning performance in heterogeneous data distribution scenarios.
However, these approaches still require heavy parameter transmission in the learning process.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To allow devices equipped with heterogeneous models in FL, knowledge distillation (KD)-based FL approaches were developed and attracted much attention. In practical wireless networks, devices usually possess different computation capabilities and communication resources. Thus, requiring all the local models to be of the same architecture in many application scenarios may be ineffective.
KD is a teacher-student paradigm which transfers the knowledge distilled from the teacher model to the student model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Integrating KD into FL allows devices to independently design their models according to channel conditions and computation capabilities.
Specifically, the federated KD approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> effectively enabled federated training between heterogeneous models by aggregating local models’ logits on a public dataset.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, an auxiliary distillation dataset generated by mixing local training data was adopted to empower the FL process, effectively reducing convergence time.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, a lightweight generator was deployed at the server to ensemble user information and broadcast to devices to regulate their local training process.
By deploying an unlabelled dataset on both the server and devices, a global model was trained using the averaged outputs of local models on this dataset as the supervision label <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
The adaptive mutual KD and dynamic gradient compression approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> significantly reduced communication costs and achieved competitive results with centralized model learning.
The federated distillation method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> regularized local models to mitigate overfitting during training by treating the global model as the teacher and the local models as the students.
Besides enabling devices to design their machine learning models independently, the KD-based FL substantially reduces the transmitted data volume in the wireless channels because output logits are required to upload in the learning process instead of heavy model/gradient parameters.
However, these KD-based FL approaches require an extra public dataset to align the student and teacher models’ outputs, increasing the computation costs. Moreover, their performance may significantly degrade with the increase in the distribution divergence between the public and on-device datasets that are usually non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID).</p>

In addition, the KD-based FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> allowed devices to ensemble heterogeneous local models. However, they rely on the public dataset, which may not be practical for many scenarios.
To break these limitations, this work aims to enable collaborative training for devices equipped with heterogeneous models in a communication-efficient way, avoiding the reliance on heavy model transmission and extra public datasets.
Inspired by the human experience in discriminating between different objects and its successful application in clustering analysis, the same class of objects or data usually have similar high-level features, while different objects have distinct features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. In addition, a general insight for modern deep learning models is that the lower layers (close to the input) are primarily responsible for feature extraction, while the upper layers (proximate to the output) focus on complex pattern recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
We aim to enable devices for collaborative training by aggregating their output of lower layers of the NNs, namely knowledge, in the per-round training process. This design effectively reduces the communication overhead since the dimensions of the knowledge are usually much smaller than that of the model.

Compared with benchmark FL algorithms, the proposed KFL framework saves 99% communication overhead and boosts 2.1% and 6.65% accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. In addition, The proposed online device scheduling algorithm achieves a faster convergence speed than benchmark scheduling approaches.</p>

It is worth mentioning that the knowledge of different devices and classes has the same dimensionality that equals the dimension of feature extractors’ output, i.e., <math id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">p</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑝</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1.m1.1c">p</annotation></semantics></math>.

However, it fits devices’ local models to their specific data and improves the learning performance on heterogeneous local data scenarios. In addition, devices can use global knowledge to regularize the local training process when new data classes are generated and rapidly adapt their local models to these new class data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional FL approaches rely on aggregating devices’ model/gradient parameters in each round, which induces remarkable communication overhead for wireless networks and requires all the local models to be of the same architecture.
To tackle these issues, we propose a novel KFL algorithm to enable collaborative training between heterogeneous local models. Specifically, devices upload their lightweight <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">knowledge</em> to the server for aggregation in the per-round training process instead of the heavy model/gradient parameters. The learning process repeats the following steps until the devices’ models converge, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I-C Organization and Notations ‣ I Introduction ‣ Knowledge-aided Federated Learning for Energy-limited Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To better illustrate the proposed KFL, we summarize the detailed steps of its training process in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ II-B Knowledge-aided Federated Learning Mechanism ‣ II System Model and Learning Mechanism ‣ Knowledge-aided Federated Learning for Energy-limited Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
It is worth mentioning that the proposed KFL requires devices to upload the knowledge to the edge server for aggregation instead of the entire local models. Devices’ knowledge is generated by averaging the output of their local feature extractor on the data samples from the same class, and the process is irreversible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Thus, KFL is more beneficial for privacy preservation than the model aggregation-based FL algorithms exchanging local models between devices and the edge server. The reason is that the local models are updated according to the devices’ private data, whose pattern is encoded into the model parameters. Therefore, if a corresponding decoder could be constructed, the private data or statistics would be recovered inversely <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>

Note that we ignore the global knowledge broadcasting and aggregation latency in the above discussion because the broadcasting process occupies the entire bandwidth. The edge server has large transmit power, so the broadcasting latency is negligible. Moreover, the edge server is usually computationally powerful, and the global knowledge aggregation latency can be ignored compared to the above computation and communication latencies.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we theoretically analyze the convergence bound of the proposed KFL under a non-convex loss function setting.
The convergence bound reveals that the scheduled data volume in each round and different learning rounds significantly affect the learning performance. Motivated by this, we define a new metric, i.e., the weighted scheduled data volume, to guide the device scheduling design.
Then, we transfer the original problem to maximize this metric for minimizing the gap between the global loss function and the optimal loss.
To enable the online dynamic device scheduling under long-term energy budgets constraint, we further transform the problem into a deterministic problem in each round with the assistance of the Lyapunov optimization approach.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Assumption <a href="#Thmass1" title="Assumption 1. ‣ III-A Convergence Analysis ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Knowledge-aided Federated Learning for Energy-limited Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> is satisfied by most deep NNs.
The modern NNs are usually composed of multiple layers. Based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, a deep NN defined by a composition of functions is a Lipschitz NN if the functions in all layers are Lipschitz. It has been proved in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> that the convolution layer, linear layer, and some nonlinear activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid and tanh) are Lipschitz functions. Thus, most deep NNs have Lipschitz continuous gradients.
For a Lipschitz NN in which all layers are Lipschitz functions, both the feature extractor and predictor composed of Lipschitz layers are Lipschitz functions.
Thus, Assumption <a href="#Thmass1" title="Assumption 1. ‣ III-A Convergence Analysis ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Knowledge-aided Federated Learning for Energy-limited Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> is satisfied by assuming the whole NN to be Lipschitz continuous. In addition, according to Proposition 1 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, one can derive that <math id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.2"

In general, the non-IID degree is characterized by the difference between the optimal global loss and the weighted summation of optimal local losses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. However, the proposed KFL is a personalized FL algorithm which trains a personalized model for each device.

In the simulations, each device first computes the number of correct predicted data samples on its test dataset by its local model.
Note that the deployed trained models on devices are the same in FedAvg, while each device has a personalized local model in the proposed KFL.
Then, the test accuracy is computed as the total number of correct predicted test data samples on all devices divided by the total number of test data samples on all devices.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the performance of the proposed KFL algorithm by comparing it with the following benchmarks. Note that, devices are equipped with homogeneous local models, and we do not consider the energy and bandwidth limitation in this subsection.
1) FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>: In each round, the scheduled devices upload their model parameters to the edge server for aggregation.
2) FedRep <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>: The scheduled devices sequentially train the feature extractor and label predictor parts of their models in each round. Particularly, the scheduled devices only upload feature extractor part of their models to the edge server for aggregation.
3) APFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>: In each round, each scheduled device trains its own local model and the received global model from the edge server. Then APFL incorporates the devices’ locally trained model and the updated global model to achieve a device-specific model.
It is worth mentioning that the proposed KFL algorithm requires fewer parameters transmission in each round than the benchmarks and thus reduces the communication cost.
Specifically, for the MNIST dataset, the proposed algorithm only requires devices to upload the knowledge of 10 classes, including <math id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="64\times 10=640" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">64</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><mo id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">640</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><times id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">64</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">10</cn></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">640</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">64\times 10=640</annotation></semantics></math> parameters, accounting for 0.12% of the transmitted parameters by FedAvg or by FedRep.

Note that in this subsection, devices are equipped with heterogeneous local models, and do not consider the energy and bandwidth limitations.
Since the knowledge distillation process requires aggregating devices’ model output logits on an additional proxy dataset, we sample 50 data samples from each class (for both MNIST and CIFAR-10) to construct the proxy dataset with 500 data samples.
Note that as stated in the experimental setting, our proposed algorithm only requires devices to upload 640 parameters in each round, reducing 87% of transmission costs compared with the knowledge distillation-based algorithm because the latter requires devices to upload <math id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="500\times 10=5000" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">500</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><mo id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">5000</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><times id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">500</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">10</cn></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">5000</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">500\times 10=5000</annotation></semantics></math> parameters in each round.</p>

The round robin algorithm enables devices to consume energy uniformly throughout the process. While for the Adaptive Myopic algorithm, the energy consumption at the former rounds exceeds the budget, and thus no devices are scheduled.
In fact, the proposed algorithm schedules devices in the descend scheduling pattern, while Adaptive Myopic schedules devices in the ascend scheduling pattern and Round Robin schedules devices in the uniform scheduling pattern. Thus, the result in Fig. 4(a) and <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-C Performance of the Proposed Device Scheduling Algorithm ‣ V Numerical Results ‣ Knowledge-aided Federated Learning for Energy-limited Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> also verified the correctness of our theoretical analysis in Remark 1, i.e., more data samples should be scheduled in the early rounds under restricted resources budgets.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have developed a novel KFL framework which aggregates devices’ knowledge to enable collaborative training between devices. The benefits of this framework are three folds: 1) Allowing devices with heterogeneous models to train machine learning models collaboratively. 2) Significantly reducing the communication overhead of devices compared to conventional model aggregation-based FL approaches. 3) Mitigating the impact of non-IID data distribution among devices on learning performance.
Experimental results show that compared to conventional model aggregation-based FL algorithms, the proposed KFL framework is able to reduce 99% communication load while boosting 2.1% and 6.65% accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively.
In addition, we have theoretically and experimentally revealed that more scheduled data samples should be biased to the early rounds if the scheduled data samples of the entire learning process are fixed.
With this insight, we have developed an efficient online device scheduling and resource allocation algorithm to improve learning performance under devices’ limited energy budgets.
Experimental results show that the proposed online device scheduling algorithm converges faster than the benchmark device scheduling algorithms.
In the future work, we will optimize the local models’ design according to the devices’ computing capabilities and datasets for further improving the learning performance of KFL.</p>

<div class="ltx_abstract">
<p id="id1.2.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional model/gradient aggregation-based federated learning (FL) approaches require all local models to be of the same architecture and thus may be inapplicable for many practical scenarios. Moreover, the frequent model/gradient exchange is costly for resource-limited wireless networks since modern deep neural networks usually have over-million parameters.
To tackle these challenges, we first devise a novel FL framework that aggregates light high-level data features, namely knowledge, in the per-round learning process. This design allows devices to design their machine models independently and remarkably reduces the communication overhead in the training process.
We then theoretically analyze the convergence bound of the framework under a non-convex loss function setting, revealing that scheduling more data volumes in each round helps improve the learning performance. In addition, more scheduled data volumes should be biased towards the early rounds if the total data volumes during the entire learning course are fixed.
Inspired by this, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the weighted scheduled data volumes for global loss minimization under the energy constraints of devices through device scheduling, bandwidth allocation and power control.
This paper provides the proof and additional experimental results of the journal version, namely “Knowledge-aided Federated Learning for Energy-limited Wireless Networks”. This paper
provides the proofs of Proposition 1, Lemma 3, and additional experimental results based on another heterogeneous data distribution setting. The other proposition, lemmas, and experimental results have been provided in the journal version or similar to the provided proofs.</p>
