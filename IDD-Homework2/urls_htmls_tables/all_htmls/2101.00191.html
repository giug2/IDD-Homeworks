<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) can empower Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) networks by leveraging smart vehicles (SVs) to participate in the learning process with minimum data exchanges and privacy disclosure. The collected data and learned knowledge can help the vehicular service provider (VSP) improve the global model accuracy, e.g., for road safety as well as better profits for both VSP and participating SVs. Nonetheless, there exist major challenges when implementing the FL in IoV networks, such as dynamic activities and diverse quality-of-information (QoI) from a large number of SVs, VSP’s limited payment budget, and profit competition among SVs. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic FL-based economic framework for an IoV network to address these challenges. Specifically, the VSP first implements an SV selection method to determine a set of the best SVs for the FL process according to the significance of their current locations and information history at each learning round. Then, each selected SV can collect on-road information and offer a payment contract to the VSP based on its collected QoI. For that, we develop a multi-principal one-agent contract-based policy to maximize the profits of the VSP and learning SVs under the VSP’s limited payment budget and asymmetric information between the VSP and SVs. Through experimental results using real-world on-road datasets, we show that our framework can converge 57% faster (even with only 10% of active SVs in the network) and obtain much higher social welfare of the network (up to 27.2 times) compared with those of other baseline FL methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to the recent Allied Market Research’s outlook <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the global market value of the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) is expected to grow by more than 215% in 2024 due to significant demands of road safety from smart vehicles (SVs), e.g., autonomous cars and electric vehicles. Through the IoV, the vehicular service provider (VSP) can build on-road services to enhance the driving safety for the SV users. In particular, the VSP can first obtain on-road data from active SVs e.g., road conditions, location, and driving activities. Using the centralized learning process, the VSP can then generate the meaningful on-road information with high quality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and share the updated on-road information to requesting customers (e.g., SVs, public transportations, local governments, and mobile users) in its coverage areas. In fact, the aforementioned mechanism has been widely adopted by several commercial on-road applications, e.g., the Placemeter (www.placemeter.com), Google Maps (www.google.com/maps), and Waze (www.waze.com). However, sharing raw on-road data to the VSP in a centralized manner may face the huge computation and storage costs for the VSP, privacy disclosure for the SV users, and severe network congestion in the IoV (when a huge amount of data is transferred over the network). Therefore, federated learning (FL) as a highly-effective distributed machine learning approach has a great potential to address these issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Specifically, instead of sharing raw on-road data, each SV in the FL-based IoV network can train its local on-road data to generate the local trained model. This local model is then collected by the VSP to update the global on-road model, aiming at enhancing the on-road model accuracy. By doing so, we can mitigate the inherent problems that occur in the centralized learning systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the applications of FL-based IoV networks have been studied in a few works, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, the conventional FL model is inefficient or even impractical to be implemented in real-world IoV networks due to several reasons. First, the behaviors of SVs in the networks are very dynamic in practice, e.g., some SVs move frequently, while some other SVs are occasionally disconnected from the network (e.g., due to unreliable communication channels, multiple handovers, and Internet unvailability at particular periods). Furthermore, training local datasets and collecting local trained models from all the SVs in the networks for the learning process are costly and impractical due to huge communication overheads, especially with a large number of moving SVs. Second, the quality-of-information (QoI), that includes on-road data in various locations at different times <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, obtained by the SVs is remarkably diverse. That makes the concurrent learning process from all SVs even worse when some SVs have low QoI. Third, due to the VSP’s limited payment budget and the inherent profit competition among SVs, how to optimally incentivize the “right” SVs for their contributions to the FL process while maximizing the profit of VSP still remains as an open issue, especially under the information asymmetry between the VSP and SVs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the first challenge due to dynamic activities of a large number of SVs, solutions to select/schedule only a set of FL local learners, e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, and vehicles, in the wireless networks can be adopted. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors introduce random scheduling, round-robin, and proportional fair methods to choose FL learners. Other random selection methods using asynchronous FL and heterogeneous networks are also discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, respectively. However, these works assume that the selected FL learners can implement local learning process equally without considering their QoI (the second aforementioned challenge). In fact, the QoI obtained by SVs in the IoV networks varies dramatically <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, e.g., some SVs are not moving for a certain period, and thus they may provide low QoI. Consequently, the low QoI can degrade the prediction accuracy or cause FL performance instability (when the low-quality trained local models are aggregated together with other local models during the learning process) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, leading to a lower profit for the VSP. Furthermore, all the above works do not consider any incentive mechanism to compensate the selected FL learners for the learning process, and thus discourage the FL learners to participate in and contribute high QoI for the next FL processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Note that a “right” incentive mechanism can also in turn help to “recruit” the “right” SVs. Designing such an incentive model is challenging, especially under the limited budget of the VSP, the competition among the SVs, as well as the information asymmetry between the VSP and selected SVs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we aim to address the aforementioned challenges through proposing a novel dynamic FL-based economic framework that selectively engages a subset of best SVs for the FL process at each learning round. Specifically, the VSP can first select active SVs whose current locations are within significant areas. These significant areas are determined based on the Average Annual Daily Flow (AADF), i.e., the average number of vehicles passing through pre-defined roads in a particular area on one day <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. From the set of active SVs based on the location significance, the VSP can further choose the best SVs based on their information significance (or QoI) history, e.g., due to the VSP’s limited payment budget for the learning SVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Through combining both location and information significance, the VSP can obtain useful on-road information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and reliable trained model updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> from the selected SVs, aiming at enhancing the learning quality of the FL. From this SV selection, the VSP can provide an incentive mechanism for the best SVs which share their current information significance for the FL process. Nonetheless, due to the the VSP’s limited payment budget and the existence of multiple learning SVs at each round, each selected SV may compete with other selected SVs in obtaining the corresponding payment as the incentive of its local training process. To address this issue, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> propose a non-collaborative Stackelberg game model where the VSP and mobile devices act as a leader and followers, respectively. However, these methods are only applicable when the mobile devices know the full information of the VSP’s payment budget (referred to as <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">information symmetry</em>). In practice, the VSP usually keeps its payment budget confidential (referred to as <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">information asymmetry</em>) and the best SVs may not want to follow controls by the VSP completely (due to the conflict of economic interests between them) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Hence, the above approaches are ineffective to implement in our problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Given the above, we develop a <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">multi-principal one-agent (MPOA)</em> contract-based economic model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, where the best SVs (as <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">principals</em>) non-collaboratively offer contract agreements (containing information significance and offered payment) to the VSP. The VSP (as <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the agent</em>) is then in charge of optimizing the offered contracts. In this case, we formulate the contract model as a non-collaborative learning contract problem to maximize the profits of the VSP and the best SVs at each round under the VSP’s information-asymmetry and common constraints, i.e., the individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC). The IR constraints ensure that the VSP always joins the FL process. Meanwhile, the IC constraints guarantee that the VSP always obtains the maximum profit when the best contract determined for the VSP is applied. To find the optimal contracts for the SVs, we first transform the contract optimization problem into an equivalent low-complexity problem. We then develop an iterative algorithm which can quickly find the equilibrium solution, i.e., optimal contracts, for the transformed problem. After that, the VSP and selected SVs can execute the FL algorithm to improve the global on-road model accuracy at each learning round. Moreover, at the end of each round, the VSP can update its net profit considering the current round’s global model accuracy and freshness (i.e., how up-to-date the global model in the FL process is). We then conduct experiments using real-world on-road datasets from all major roads of 190 areas/local districts and 1.5M traffic accidents in the United Kingdom (UK) between 2000 and 2016. The experiment results demonstrate that our framework can improve the social welfare of the network up to 27.2 times and speed up the learning convergence up to 57% compared with those of the baseline FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Although a few recent works, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, have studied the contract theory in FL, their proposed approaches have some limitations and are inapplicable in IoV networks. First, they only select the FL learners based on the QoI without considering location significance which is one of the most important factors in IoV networks. Second, both works assume that the FL learners’ data with certain quality have been collected prior to the FL learner selection. This is impractical in IoV networks where the SVs are dynamically moving, and thus the QoI may vary over time. Third, they are limited to the <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">one-principal multi-agent</em>-based contract policy, i.e., not accounting for the competition among FL learners. Moreover, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> implements the contract optimization only once and utilizes the same FL learners for the entire FL process until reaching a convergence. Meanwhile, the FL learner selection in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is determined by the vehicular users (not the central server). As such, there is a possibility that some candidate FL learners with high QoI may not be able to join in the FL process, and thus the overall prediction model accuracy can be degraded. To the end, the major contributions of our work are as follows:</p>

From this status, the SV can pre-process and extract meaningful on-road information and store it in a log file at the SV’s local storage. In particular, the information may include the SV’s visited location history, date, time, light condition (e.g., dark or light), weather condition (e.g., windy, snowy, or rainy), and road surface condition (e.g., dry or wet). To collaborate with the VSP in the FL process, the interested SV users can first deploy an on-road service application developed by the VSP at their SVs’ built-in Android or iOS platforms, e.g., Live Traffic NSW (www.livetraffic.com) and Live Traffic Info (www.highwaysengland.co.uk). Then, the SV users can enable the application’s access permission to allow the VSP accessing basic information including the SVs’ current location and information significance in a secure manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In this way, the VSP can observe useful information to select the best SVs (which act as the FL learners at each learning round, e.g., every hour or day) within its coverage (e.g., via road side units <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>) with minimum privacy disclosure of the SVs’ collected on-road data. Note that the accessed current location information is only used to help the VSP select the best SVs for each learning round (as similarly implemented in location-based services such as Google Maps, Placemeter, and Waze), and is totally different from on-road sensing data that the selected SVs collect when they run on the road.

As such, the VSP with a higher type has a higher weight due to its willingness to pay more towards the FL process. For the satisfaction function, we use a squared-root function as similarly implemented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The reason is that the satisfaction increases when the QoI, i.e., information significance, gets better. However, the VSP may have less interest to further increase the satisfaction when the higher data quality triggers less on-road model accuracy improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When more active SVs with high information significance are recruited for the FL execution, the converged global on-road model with high accuracy can be achieved faster. In this way, the VSP can obtain more up-to-date global on-road model, and thus achieve a higher freshness value when selling this model to the potential customers, such as SVs, public transportations, and mobile users. The adoption of information freshness in FL has been recently investigated in the literature. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> propose an FL scheduling strategy considering the freshness of FL learners’ local trained models, aiming at computing the staleness level of the local models for the global model update. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, the authors present an incentive mechanism for the FL process accounting for the freshness of collected data at each FL learner towards the completion of FL process. Different from the existing works, we consider the freshness of produced global model at each learning round and analyze its impact on the VSP’s profit.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, the profit of the VSP is influenced by not only the decision of contract optimization, but also the obtained global model accuracy and freshness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the literature accounting for the influence of global model accuracy and freshness towards the economic aspect of the typical FL process. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic global model economic value considering the product of global model accuracy and freshness at each learning round <math id="S6.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p2.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math>, which is expressed by</p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">From (<a href="#S6.E46" title="In 6 VSP’s Profit Analysis Based on the Global Model Accuracy and Freshness ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">46</span></a>), we can observe the relationship between the net profit of the VSP and the global model economic value (through the global model accuracy and freshness values). In particular, the earlier the VSP can obtain the high-accurate global prediction model, the more freshness and thus the higher economic value the global model can achieve (as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 6 VSP’s Profit Analysis Based on the Global Model Accuracy and Freshness ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). However, in practice, at the early learning rounds, the accuracy of the global prediction model is not really high due to insufficient number of trained samples in the FL process (as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 6 VSP’s Profit Analysis Based on the Global Model Accuracy and Freshness ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(c)) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Moreover, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 6 VSP’s Profit Analysis Based on the Global Model Accuracy and Freshness ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(d), the net profit of the VSP will first increase up to the first 15 learning rounds due to high freshness value and increasing accuracy of the global model. Although the global model accuracy gets improved for the rest of learning rounds, the existence of lower freshness value will trigger lower global model economic value, and thus the net profit of the VSP also decreases gradually. Therefore, this observation provides an insightful information for the VSP to determine the best global model economic value which improves its profit in the IoV accounting for the trade-off between the global model accuracy and freshness for each learning round.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Next, we split the accident dataset into 0.8 training set and 0.2 testing set. Additionally, we consider two data distribution scenarios, i.e., i.i.d and non-i.i.d scenarios. For i.i.d scenario, it occurs when most of the learning SVs in the IoV network have visited many locations at different times frequently, e.g., taxi or long-trip public transport, and thus they can collect on-road data with various accident severity levels. In this case, we distribute the training set randomly to the <em id="S7.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">h-SVs</em>, <em id="S7.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">m-SVs</em>, and <em id="S7.SS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">l-SVs</em> based on their information significance. Meanwhile, for non-i.i.d scenario, it takes place when most of the learning SVs have only passed through specific limited locations most of the times, e.g., the school bus or city public transport, such that each learning SV has very-limited and fixed accident severity information. Specifically, we first divide the training set randomly into 3 training subsets for <em id="S7.SS2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">h-SVs</em>, <em id="S7.SS2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">m-SVs</em>, and <em id="S7.SS2.p3.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">l-SVs</em>. Then, we sort each training subset according to the training label. Each sorted training subset is distributed to the corresponding number of learning SVs based on their information significance. To implement the DNN, we use two hidden layers with 128 and 64 neurons per layer and one final layer with 3 neurons (which corresponding to 3 labels). We also use the Adam optimizer with initial step size 0.01.</p>

<div id="S7.SS3.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first evaluate the validity of the VSP’s common constraints, i.e., IR and IC constraints, considered in the contract optimization at a specific learning round, e.g., the first round in this case. Specifically, we can observe the IR constraints of the VSP for all methods in Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 7.3.1 Common constraint validity and profit of the VSP ‣ 7.3 Learning Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(a)-(b) and Fig. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.3.1 Common constraint validity and profit of the VSP ‣ 7.3 Learning Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(a)-(b) for i.i.d and non-i.i.d scenarios, respectively, with various numbers of learning SVs. In this case, the profits of proposed methods coincide with each other due to the VSP’s limited budget constraint for the VSP’s each type. From these figures, the VSP can always obtain positive profits for all types of the VSP, thereby ensuring the feasibility of the IR constraints as shown in (<a href="#S4.E16" title="In Definition 1. ‣ 4.2 Profit Optimization for Learning SVs ‣ 4 MPOA-Based Learning Contract Optimization Problem and Solution ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>). These profits monotonically increase with respect to the VSP’s type such that the VSP with a higher type will obtain a higher profit. The reason is that the VSP is willing to pay more money to the learning SVs due to higher payment budget. Additionally, we can observe that more learning SVs, i.e., 10 learning SVs, will produce higher profits for the VSP up to 1.95 times, respectively, compared with that of 5 learning SVs. This is because more learning SVs can provide larger training data sizes and better information significance values for the FL process. Meanwhile, compared with other methods, the proposed-LIS can achieve higher VSP’s profit up to 2.63 and 1.8 times for i.i.d and non-i.i.d scenarios, respectively.
For Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 7.3.1 Common constraint validity and profit of the VSP ‣ 7.3 Learning Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(c)-(d) and Fig. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.3.1 Common constraint validity and profit of the VSP ‣ 7.3 Learning Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(c)-(d), we observe that the VSP can always obtain the highest profit when it utilizes the right contract for its true type. In this way, the IC constraints for all types of the VSP are also satisfied. Particularly, the VSP with types 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will produce the highest profit when the suitable contracts for those types are used. As both IR and IC constraints hold, we can find the feasible contracts for all learning SVs to maximize their profits at each round.</p>

Similar to the VSP’s profit performance, the proposed-LIS can achieve higher learning SVs’ total profits up to 21 and 18.2 times for 5 and 10 learning SVs, respectively, in the i.i.d scenario as well as 5.27 and 8.93 times for 5 and 10 learning SVs, respectively, in the non-i.i.d scenario, compared with those of random and round-robin scheduling methods. The reason is that both methods are likely to train the dataset with very low data size and quality without considering the location-information significance. We also observe that although the proposed-LS can achieve the total profit of learning SVs close to that of proposed-LIS, the proposed-LIS can increase the performance gap by 1.38 and 1.31 times for i.i.d and non-i.i.d scenarios, respectively, when a higher type is employed by the VSP.
The above performance aligns with the social welfare of the network in Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7.3.2 The profits of SVs and social welfare of the IoV ‣ 7.3 Learning Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(c)-(d) and Fig. <a href="#S7.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 7.3.2 The profits of SVs and social welfare of the IoV ‣ 7.3 Learning Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(c)-(d). Specifically, the proposed-LS and proposed-LIS can improve the social welfare up to 3.63 and 4.2 times (i.i.d scenario) as well as 2.44 and 2.74 times (non-i.i.d scenario), respectively, compared with those of random and round-robin scheduling methods.</p>

In particular, when 5 SVs are used to perform the FL algorithm for each round as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7.4.1 I.i.d scenario ‣ 7.4 Dynamic Federated Learning Accuracy Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>(a), the proposed-LIS can converge 57% (or 17 rounds) earlier than those of the random scheduling and round-robin with an accuracy of 85%. Furthermore, the proposed-LIS can achieve the convergence 28% (or 5 rounds) faster than that of the proposed-LS at the same accuracy level. This is because the proposed-LIS only selects an SV with high information significance within the significant areas. Meanwhile, the baseline FL methods select the learning SVs from the total active SVs without considering the location and information significance-based SV selection. In this case, there exists high probability that they only use <em id="S7.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">l-SVs</em> most of the learning rounds, leading to a slow convergence. For the proposed-LS, it only selects SVs in the significant areas without information significance consideration. As a result, its convergence accuracy will be slightly delayed. These accuracy performances align with the global loss ones in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7.4.1 I.i.d scenario ‣ 7.4 Dynamic Federated Learning Accuracy Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>(c) where the proposed-LIS can reach the fastest minimum convergence compared with other learning methods.</p>

Specifically, the learning methods other than the proposed-LIS can improve the accuracy convergence speed by 18% (or 6 rounds) because of the existence of more accurate/meaningful local models from more learning SVs. Nevertheless, this observation does not apply for the proposed-LIS. The reason is that when each learning SV contains i.i.d local dataset with high information significance, the aggregation of all local models at the VSP will generate the same model accuracy compared with the condition when one <em id="S7.SS4.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">h-SV</em> is used.

Nevertheless, the proposed-LIS eventually can achieve the convergence within 30 learning rounds with accuracy level 85%. Specifically, the proposed-LIS still outperforms the proposed-LS up to 17.5% (or 7 rounds) in terms of convergence speed due to the selection guarantee of <em id="S7.SS4.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">h-SVs</em>.

<p id="S7.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section discusses how the global model accuracy and the global model freshness obtained from the learning process at each round can influence the profits of the VSP (with type 10) and learning SVs as well as the social welfare of the network obtained from the contract optimization. As observed in Fig. <a href="#S7.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 7.5 Relationship Between Contract and Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>(a)-(b) when i.i.d datasets are used, the net profit of the VSP (when using the proposed-LS and proposed-LIS) first suffers from negative profit during the first three learning rounds for all cases. The reason is that although the VSP can obtain high information significance values from the learning SVs at these rounds, the obtained global model accuracy cannot compensate the satisfaction function due to the higher cost, i.e., high payment for the learning SVs with high QoI. As the learning round increases, the global model accuracy start to improve significantly by 60%, thereby enhancing the net profit of the VSP (with the maximum profit between round 10 and 15). Due to the global model freshness impact and less accuracy improvement at further learning rounds, the profit of the VSP gradually decreases. Nonetheless, our proposed-LS and proposed-LIS can still outperform other methods up to 7.25 and 8.92 times in terms of the VSP’s net profit, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the total net profit of learning SVs, the performance is not affected by the global model accuracy and freshness. Alternatively, it remains the same as the one obtained from the contract optimization. The reason is that the profits of learning SVs depend only on their current round’s trained datasets with certain information significance values, and computation as well as memory costs at the learning SVs. As can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S7.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 7.5 Relationship Between Contract and Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>(c)-(d), our proposed-LIS can achieve the highest total profit performance of learning SVs for most rounds due to the use of more <em id="S7.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">h-SVs</em>. Similar trends with more fluctuated profit performance can be observed in Fig. <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 7.5 Relationship Between Contract and Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> when non-i.i.d datasets are used for the cases of 5 and 10 learning SVs. However, the use of 5 learning SVs in Fig. <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 7.5 Relationship Between Contract and Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(a) and Fig. <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 7.5 Relationship Between Contract and Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(c) triggers low net profits for both VSP and learning SVs of the proposed-LS and proposed-LIS during the first 16 and 27 learning rounds, respectively (due to the unstable accuracy performance in Fig. <a href="#S7.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 7.4.2 Non-i.i.d scenario ‣ 7.4 Dynamic Federated Learning Accuracy Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>(a)). To support the performances in Fig. <a href="#S7.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 7.5 Relationship Between Contract and Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 7.5 Relationship Between Contract and Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>, we show the final social welfare for both i.i.d and non-i.i.d scenarios in Fig. <a href="#S7.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 7.5 Relationship Between Contract and Federated Learning Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Dynamic Federated Learning-Based Economic Framework for Internet-of-Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>. Specifically, the trend of social welfare follows the one of the VSP’s net profit with increased profit values due to addition of learning SVs’ total profit. In this case, our proposed-LIS can achieve the social welfare up to 24.5 and 27.2 times for i.i.d and non-i.i.d scenarios, respectively, compared with those of other methods.
To this end, we can summarize that the i.i.d scenario can provide more stable economic benefit performance throughout the learning rounds compared with that of the non-i.i.d scenario. However, the non-i.i.d scenario will provide more practical economic benefit performance because of the unique and biased dataset (generated from diverse mobile activities) at each learning SV in the practical IoV network.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed the novel economic framework for the IoV network to maximize the profits for the VSP and learning SVs in the dynamic FL process. Specifically, we have introduced the dynamic SV selection method to determine a set of active SVs based on the significance of their locations and information at each learning round. From the set of selected SVs, each SV can first collect on-road data and then offer a payment contract to the VSP with respect to its QoI. In this case, we have developed the MPOA-based contract optimization problem under the competition of learning SVs and the VSP’s common constraints (i.e., the IR and IC constraints) as well as incomplete information of payment budget. To find the optimal contracts, we have transformed the problem into the equivalent low-complexity problem and then implemented the iterative contract algorithm which can achieve the equilibrium solution for all the learning SVs at each learning round. We have also analyzed the convergence of proposed FL and investigated on how the accuracy and freshness of the global prediction model obtained by the FL process at each round affect the net profits of the VSP and learning SVs as well as the social welfare of the network. Through the experimental results, we have shown that our proposed framework can significantly improve the FL convergence speed, profits of the VSP and learning SVs, and the social welfare of the network compared with other baseline FL methods.</p>
