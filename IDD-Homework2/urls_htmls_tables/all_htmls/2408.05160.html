<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Hypergraph neural networks enhance conventional graph neural networks by capturing high-order relationships among nodes, which proves vital in data-rich environments where interactions are not merely pairwise. As data complexity and interconnectivity grow, it is common for graph-structured data to be split and stored in a distributed manner, underscoring the necessity of federated learning on subgraphs. In this work, we propose FedHGN, a novel algorithm for federated hypergraph learning. Our algorithm utilizes subgraphs of a hypergraph stored on distributed devices to train local HGNN models in a federated manner—by collaboratively developing an effective global HGNN model through sharing model parameters while preserving client privacy. Additionally, considering that hyperedges may span multiple clients, a pre-training step is employed before the training process in which cross-client hyperedge feature gathering is performed at the central server. In this way, the missing cross-client information can be supplemented from the central server during the node feature aggregation phase. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hypergraphs, as a type of complex graph structure, enable the connection of multiple nodes through single hyperedges. Compared to simple graphs, hypergraphs offer advantages by capturing higher-order relationships that reflect the multi-dimensional interconnectivity present in various real-world data structures. Recently, hypergraph neural networks have gained prominence as tools for mining features and patterns on complex graph-structured data in data-rich environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Feng et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Yadati et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Xia et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, hypergraph works face the same significant challenges as simple graphs: the rapid growth and sheer volume of data necessitate distributed storage, while stringent data protection regulations complicate data sharing across distributed systems. This scenario calls for robust solutions that enable efficient distributed training of hypergraph neural networks across decentralized data sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is developed to address the challenges of training neural networks in distributed environments, enhancing data privacy and security by allowing multiple participants to collaboratively build a shared model without sharing their local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Based on federated learning, several works on federated graph learning have been proposed to effectively train graph neural networks across multiple decentralized data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Yao et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2024</a>; Chen et al. <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Lei et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. These efforts specifically tackle the loss of cross-subgraph information, a critical issue that often leads to incomplete node representations and potentially degraded model performance. This issue arises because each local system holds only a portion of the entire graph, resulting in lost connections between different subgraphs.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span><span id="Sx1.F1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A potential application scenario of federated hypergraph learning:</span> In a large-scale network, several ISPs manage multiple network nodes, including routers and user access points. During network operations, data flows are generated through packet exchanges among nodes. Since users may be serviced by different ISPs, these data flows can span multiple ISPs. The goal of federated hypergraph learning is to enable ISPs to collaboratively train a global network model while ensuring privacy, for applications such as predicting link performance or diagnosing network faults.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While federated learning on simple graphs has been extensively studied, the scenario changes significantly when it comes to hypergraphs, making existing methods inapplicable.
Using the computer networks as a potential application scenarios of federated hypergraph learning: graph neural networks are increasingly employed in network modeling for studying and analyzing its performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rusek et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Ferriol-Galmés et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Zhou et al. <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. As shown in Figure <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Federated Hypergraph Learning with Hyperedge Completion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, in a typical network environment, multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) collectively provide network services to users but avoid sharing internal data due to privacy concerns. Network administrators aim to predict future network performance metrics (such as throughput and latency) or classify the operational status or types of the network devices based on network performance data. To develop a comprehensive model that can analyze the overall state of the network while adhering to privacy protection, it is essential that ISPs collaboratively participate in the model training process in a federated manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For scenarios including the above, where high-order relationships exist among nodes, federated graph learning is required. To be specific, existing graph neural network methods for network modeling represent network node metrics as input features and physical links as adjacency relationships within the graph. This modeling approach overlooks the communications between multiple devices in network operations, i.e., the data flows transmitted along paths planned by routers. While inadequately represented in conventional graphs, the data flow can be precisely depicted using hyperedges, thereby necessitating the adoption of hypergraph neural networks. Moreover, the inability to share data across ISPs leads to the loss of cross-client data flow information, which may result in severe performance degradation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose FedHGN, a novel federated hypergraph learning algorithm to address the above challenges. We select HGNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Feng et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> as the graph mining model, considering its advantageous property of updating node features in two stages: edge feature collection and node feature aggregation. In FedHGN, independent HGNN models are deployed on each client, and the global model parameters are updated and synchronized to the clients using the FedAVG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> algorithm. We first propose a basic version of FedHGN that trims cross-client hyperedges to minimize node relationship loss within clients while adhering to privacy regulations. Furthermore, to prevent the loss of cross-client information, an <math id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mi id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">N</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1b"><ci id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1.1">𝑁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx1.p5.1.m1.1c">N</annotation></semantics></math>-round pre-training hyperedge completion (HC) operation is introduced. In the pre-training step, clients share the processed embeddings of border nodes with the central server, thus enabling the aggregation of cross-client hyperedge features. Subsequently, the missing cross-client information is completed by using the border hyperedge features distributed by the server. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">The primary goal of federated learning is to enable distributed model training while protecting privacy. Therefore, any information sharing between clients or between clients and the server must ensure that the privacy of the raw features is not compromised. Our HC operation has good properties that avoid the use of high-cost privacy protection methods such as homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#Sx3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Problem Setup ‣ Federated Hypergraph Learning ‣ Federated Hypergraph Learning with Hyperedge Completion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, there are two scenarios during the HC process where privacy leakage can occur: when clients upload the embeddings to the central server, and when the central server distributes the features of border hyperedges to the clients.

Under different datasets and client number settings, our proposed FedHGN achieves optimal node classification accuracy. Before performing HC operation, the basic version of FedHGN outperformed the independently trained local HGNN models on the clients, with an average improvement of 5.9%. The performance gap between our federated hypergraph learning algorithm and local hypergraph models demonstrates the benefits of joint training across multiple clients. Furthermore, after conducting HC operation, the basic FedHGN is further improved by 6.8%, reducing the performance drop compared to the global HGNN from an average of 10.3% to 3.5%. The performance improvement brought by the HC operation indicates the impact of cross-client information loss and the effectiveness of our pre-training operation, which can be observed from the comparison between local HGNN models with and without the HC operation.</p>

These subgraph federated learning methods address the issue of cross-client edge information loss in simple graphs. Specifically, FedSage, which employs GraphSage model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hamilton, Ying, and Leskovec <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> locally, and FedGCN (0-hop), which shares 0-hop neighbor information, both ignore any cross-client information loss between clients, similar to FedHGN without HC. Meanwhile, FedSage+ generates missing nodes for clients through additional training; FedGCN (2-hop) uploads information from two neighbors of the target nodes to the server, where it computes the target node’s embeddings. These two methods address cross-client information loss issues similar to FedHGN with HC. FedCog uses the SGC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> model and achieves federated subgraph learning without information loss through graph decoupling operations.

<p id="Sx5.SSx2.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Table <a href="#Sx5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Results and Discussion ‣ Performance on Hypergraph ‣ Experiments ‣ Federated Hypergraph Learning with Hyperedge Completion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the experimental results of FedHGN for semi-supervised node classification on three simple graph datasets demonstrate its optimal performance. Before incorporating the HC operation, FedHGN did not have an advantage over other methods that ignore cross-client information loss. One potential reason is that we generate hyperedges by selecting the 1-hop neighbors from the simple graph without introducing other high-order information. However, the HC operation supplements missing cross-client information, allowing FedHGN to recover and surpass the performance of the current state-of-the-art federated subgraph learning methods. The results show that FedHGN not only addresses hypergraph mining tasks where traditional methods are not applicable but also provides a superior solution for handling cross-client information loss in federated subgraph learning.</p>

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The increasing complexity of graph data and the trend toward distributed storage demand advanced federated hypergraph learning methods. In this work, we introduce FedHGN, a framework addressing the challenges of distributed training for higher-order graph data. Alongside deploying HGNN models locally on clients and using the FedAVG algorithm to update global parameters, our approach includes a pre-training hyperedge completion operation to mitigate cross-client information loss, thereby enhancing performance while maintaining privacy. Experimental results on real-world datasets confirm FedHGN’s effectiveness and its edge over existing federated subgraph learning methods.</p>
