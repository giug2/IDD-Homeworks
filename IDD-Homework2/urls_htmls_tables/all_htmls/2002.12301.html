<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Most edge AI focuses on prediction tasks on resource-limited edge
devices while the training is done at server machines.
However, retraining or customizing a model is required at
edge devices as the model is becoming outdated due to environmental
changes over time.
To follow such a concept drift, a neural-network based on-device
learning approach is recently proposed, so that edge devices train
incoming data at runtime to update their model.
In this case, since a training is done at distributed edge devices,
the issue is that only a limited amount of training data can be used
for each edge device.
To address this issue, one approach is a cooperative learning or
federated learning, where edge devices exchange their trained results
and update their model by using those collected from the other devices.
In this paper, as an on-device learning algorithm, we focus on OS-ELM
(Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine) to
sequentially train a model based on recent samples and
combine it with autoencoder for anomaly detection.
We extend it for an on-device federated learning so that edge devices
can exchange their trained results and update their model by using those
collected from the other edge devices.
This cooperative model update is one-shot while it can be
repeatedly applied to synchronize their model.
Our approach is evaluated with anomaly detection tasks
generated from a driving dataset of cars, a human activity dataset,
and MNIST dataset.
The results demonstrate that the proposed on-device federated learning
can produce a merged model by integrating trained results from
multiple edge devices
as accurately as traditional backpropagation based neural
networks and a traditional federated learning approach with lower
computation or communication cost.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most edge AI focuses on prediction tasks on resource-limited edge
devices assuming that their prediction model has been trained at
server machines beforehand.
However, retraining or customizing a model is
required at edge devices as the model is becoming outdated due to
environmental changes over time (i.e., concept drift).
Generally, retraining the model later to reflect environmental changes
for each edge device is a complicated task, because the server machine
needs to collect training data from the edge device, train a new model
based on the collected data, and then deliver the new model to the
edge device.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To enable the retraining a model at resource-limited edge
devices, in this paper we use a neural network based on-device
learning approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> since it can sequentially train
neural networks at resource-limited edge devices and also the neural
networks typically have a high flexibility to address various
nonlinear problems.
Its low-cost hardware implementation is also introduced in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
In this case, since a training is done independently at distributed
edge devices, the issue is that only a limited amount of training data
can be used for each edge device.
To address this issue, one approach is a cooperative model update,
where edge devices exchange their trained results and update their
model using those collected from the other devices.
Here we assume that edge devices share an intermediate form of their
weight parameters instead of raw data, which is sometimes privacy
sensitive.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we use the on-device learning approach
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> based on OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme
Learning Machine) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and autoencoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture which can be
applied to unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection, and
OS-ELM is used to sequentially train neural networks at resource-limited edge
devices.
It is then extended for the on-device federated learning so that edge
devices can exchange their trained results and update their model
using those collected from the other edge devices.
In this paper, we
employ a concept of Elastic ELM (E<sup id="S1.p3.2.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>LM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which is a
distributed training algorithm for ELM (Extreme Learning Machine)
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, so that intermediate training results are computed by
edge devices separately and then a final model is produced by
combining these intermediate results.
It is applied to the OS-ELM based on-device learning approach to
construct the on-device federated learning.
Please note that although in this paper the on-device
federated learning is applied to anomaly detection tasks since the
baseline on-device learning approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is
designed for anomaly detection tasks, the proposed approach that
employs the concept of E<sup id="S1.p3.2.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>LM is more general and can be applied to
the other machine learning tasks.
In the evaluations, we will demonstrate that the proposed on-device
federated learning can produce a merged model by integrating trained
results from multiple edge devices
as accurately as traditional backpropagation based neural
networks and a traditional federated learning approach with lower
computation or communication cost

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A federated learning framework was proposed by Google in 2016
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Their main idea is to build a global federated model at a
server side by collecting locally trained results from distributed
client devices.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a secure client-server structure that can avoid
information leakage is proposed for federated learning.
More specifically, Android phone users train their models locally
and then the model parameters are uploaded to the server side in a
secure manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Preserving of data privacy is an essential property for federated
learning systems.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a collaborative deep learning scheme
where participants selectively share their models’ key parameters is
proposed in order to keep their privacy.
In the federated learning system, participants compute gradients
independently and then upload their trained results to a parameter
server.
As another research direction, information leakage at the server side
is discussed by considering data privacy and security issues.
Actually, a leakage of these gradients may leak important data
when the data structure or training algorithm is exposed simultaneously.
To address this issue, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, an additively homomorphic
encryption is used for masking the gradients in order to preserve
participants’ privacy and enhance the security at the server side.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, some prior work involved in federated learning focuses on
the communication cost or performance in massive or unbalanced data
distribution environments.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a compression technique called Deep Gradient
Compression is proposed for large-scale distributed training in order
to reduce the communication bandwidth.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A performance of centralized model built by a federated learning
system depends on statistical nature of data collected from
client devices.
Typically, data in the client side is not always independent and
identically distributed (IID), because clients’ interest and
environment are different and sometimes degrade the model performance.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, it is shown that accuracy of a federated learning
is degraded for highly skewed Non-IID data.
This issue is addressed by creating a small subset of data which is
globally shared between all the clients.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, it is reported that locally trained
models may be forgot by a federated learning with Non-IID data, and a
penalty term is added to a loss function to prevent the knowledge
forgetting.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As a common manner, a server side in federated learning systems
has no access to local data in client devices.
There is a risk that a client may get out of normal behaviors in the
federated model training.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a dimensionality reduction based anomaly detection
approach is utilized to detect anomalous model updates from
clients in a federated learning system.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, malicious clients are identified by
clustering their submitted features, and then the final global model
is generated by excluding updates from the malicious clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Many existing federated learning systems assume
backpropagation based sophisticated neural networks but their training
is compute-intensive.
In our federated learning approach, although we also use neural
networks, we employ a recently proposed on-device learning approach
for resource-limited edge devices, which will be introduced in the
next section.
Also, please note that in our approach we assume that intermediate
training results are exchanged via a server for simplicity; however,
local training and merging from intermediate training results from
other edge devices can be completed at each edge device.</p>

In autoencoder, an input chunk is converted into a well-characterized
dimensionally reduced form at the hidden layer.
The process for the dimensionality reduction is denoted as
“encoder”, and that for decompressing the reduced form is denoted as
“decoder”.

Assuming that the model is trained with a specific input pattern,
the difference between the input data and reconstructed data (denoted
as loss value) becomes large when the input data is far from the
trained pattern.
Please note that autoencoder does not require any labeled training
data for the training phase; so it is used for unsupervised
or semi-supervised anomaly detection.
In this case, incoming data with high loss value should be
automatically rejected before training for stable anomaly detection.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the client selection strategy that determines
which models of client devices are merged, in this paper we assume a
simple case where predefined edge devices share their intermediate
trained results for simplicity.
Such client selection strategies have been studied recently. For
example, a client selection strategy that takes into account
computation and communication resource constraints is proposed for
heterogeneous edge devices in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
A client selection strategy that can improve anomaly detection
accuracy by excluding unsatisfying local models is proposed in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Our proposed on-device federated learning can be combined with these
client selection strategies in order to improve the accuracy or
efficiency, though such a direction is our future work.</p>

Then, prediction results using the merged model are compared to
those produced by traditional 3-layer BP-NN (backpropagation based
neural network) and 5-layer BP-NN in terms of the loss values and
ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve - Area Under Curve)

“before the cooperative model update”.
Those at Step 5 are denoted as “after the cooperative model
update”.
In this setup, after the cooperative model update, “Device-A that
has merged Device-B” and “Device-B that has merged Device-A” are
identical.
A low loss value means that a given input pattern is well
reconstructed by autoencoder, which means that the input pattern is
normal in the edge device.
In the first scenario, Device-A is adapted to the aggressive and normal
driving patterns with the car driving dataset.
In the second one, Device-B is adapted to the sitting and laying patterns
with the human activity dataset.

X-axis represents the input patterns.
Y-axis represents the loss values in a logarithmic scale.
Green bars represent loss values of Device-A before the cooperative
model update, while red bars represent those after the cooperative
model update.
Blue bars represent loss values of Device-B.
In the case of aggressive pattern, the loss value of Device-A before
the cooperative model update (green bar) is high, because Device-A is
trained with the normal pattern.
The loss value then becomes quite low after integrating the intermediate
results of Device-B to Device-A (red bar).
This means that the trained result of Device-B is correctly added
to Device-A.
In the case of normal pattern, the loss value before merging (green
bar) is low, but it slightly increases after the trained result
of Device-B is merged (red bar).
Nevertheless, the loss value is still quite low.
We can observe the same tendency for Device-B by comparing the blue

the cooperative model update with the human activity dataset.
Regarding the loss values, the same tendency with the driving dataset
is observed.
In the case of sitting pattern, the loss value of Device-B before
the cooperative model update (blue bar) is high, because Device-B is
trained with the laying pattern.
Then, the loss value becomes low after the trained result of
Device-A is merged (red bar).
In the case of laying pattern, the loss value of Device-A before
merging (green bar) is high and significantly decreased after merging
of the trained result of Device-B (red bar).
On the other hand, in the walking, walking_upstairs, and
walking_downstairs patterns, their loss values before and after the
cooperative model update are relatively close.
These input patterns are detected as anomalous even after the
cooperative model update, because they are not normal for both
Device-A and Device-B.
In the case of standing pattern, the similar tendency as the sitting
pattern is observed.
The loss value becomes low after the trained result of Device-A is
merged to Device-B.
This means that there is a similarity between the sitting pattern and
standing pattern.</p>

Please note that absolute values of its loss values are different from
OS-ELM based ones since their training algorithms are different.
Nevertheless, the tendency of BP-NN3 (gray bars)
is very similar to that of the proposed cooperative model update

This means that Device-B’s model after the trained result of
Device-A is merged can distinguish between normal and anomalous
input patterns as accurately as the BP-NN based autoencoder.</p>

In Figure <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 5.2.2 Results ‣ 5.2 Loss Values Before and After Model Update ‣ 5 Evaluations ‣ An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Model Update between Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, ROC-AUC scores
before the proposed cooperative model update are low
especially when trained patterns
on Device-A and Device-B have mutually distant features.
This is because Device-A is trained with one activity pattern
and unseen patterns
during the training phase should be detected as anomalous.
The ROC-AUC scores are then significantly increased overall
after integrating the intermediate results of Device-B to Device-A,
as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 5.2.2 Results ‣ 5.2 Loss Values Before and After Model Update ‣ 5 Evaluations ‣ An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Model Update between Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>.
This means that the trained result of Device-B
is correctly added to Device-A
so that Device-A can extend the coverage of normal patterns
in all the combinations of patterns.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the cases of BP-NN based models shown in Figures
<a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 5.2.2 Results ‣ 5.2 Loss Values Before and After Model Update ‣ 5 Evaluations ‣ An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Model Update between Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>-<a href="#S5.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 5.2.2 Results ‣ 5.2 Loss Values Before and After Model Update ‣ 5 Evaluations ‣ An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Model Update between Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>,
their tendencies and overall averages of ROC-AUC scores are
very similar to those after the proposed cooperative model update.
This means that the proposed cooperative model update can produce a
merged model by integrating trained results from the other edge
devices as accurately as BP-NN3, BP-NN5, and BP-NN3-FL
in terms of ROC-AUC criterion.
Please note that these BP-NN based models need to be iteratively
trained for some epochs in order to obtain their best generalization
performance, e.g., they were trained for 20 epochs in BP-NN3 and
BP-NN5.
In contrast, the proposed OS-ELM based federated learning approach
can always compute the optimal output weight matrix only in a single
epoch.</p>

ROC-AUC scores with MNIST dataset.
We can observe the same tendency
with the human activity dataset
in the four anomaly detection models.
In Figure <a href="#S5.F15" title="Figure 15 ‣ 5.3.1 Setup ‣ 5.3 ROC-AUC Scores Before and After Model Update ‣ 5 Evaluations ‣ An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Model Update between Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>, ROC-AUC scores
before the proposed cooperative mode update
are low overall except for the diagonal elements,
because Device-A is trained with one handwritten digit so that
the others should be detected as anomalous on Device-A.
Then, the ROC-AUC scores become high even in elements other than
the diagonal ones after the trained results of Device-B are merged,
as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F15" title="Figure 15 ‣ 5.3.1 Setup ‣ 5.3 ROC-AUC Scores Before and After Model Update ‣ 5 Evaluations ‣ An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Model Update between Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>.
Moreover, a similar tendency as ROC-AUC scores after the
proposed cooperative model update is observed in BP-NN3, BP-NN5, and
BP-NN3-FL,
though average ROC-AUC scores of BP-NN3, BP-NN5, and BP-NN3-FL
are slightly higher than those of the proposed cooperative model
update,
as shown in Figures <a href="#S5.F15" title="Figure 15 ‣ 5.3.1 Setup ‣ 5.3 ROC-AUC Scores Before and After Model Update ‣ 5 Evaluations ‣ An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Model Update between Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>-<a href="#S5.F17" title="Figure 17 ‣ 5.3.1 Setup ‣ 5.3 ROC-AUC Scores Before and After Model Update ‣ 5 Evaluations ‣ An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Model Update between Edge Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>.
This means that the merged model on Device-A has obtained a comparable
anomaly detection performance as the BP-NN based models
with MNIST dataset.</p>

Nevertheless, the merging latency is still modest.
Please note that the merging latency of BP-NN3-FL is required for
each communication round during a training phase, while the merging
process of our OS-ELM based federated learning approach is executed only once
(i.e., “one-shot”).
Thus, the proposed federated learning approach is light-weight

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focused on a neural-network based on-device learning
approach so that edge devices can train or correct their model based
on incoming data at runtime in order to adapt to a given environment.
Since a training is done independently at distributed edge devices,
the issue is that only a limited amount of training data can be used
for each edge device.
To address this issue, in this paper, the on-device learning algorithm
was extended for the on-device federated learning by applying the
E<sup id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>LM approach to the OS-ELM based sequential training.
In this case, edge devices can share their intermediate trained
results and update their model using those collected from the other
edge devices.
We illustrated an algorithm for the proposed cooperative model update.
Evaluation results using the car driving dataset, the
human activity dataset, and MNIST dataset demonstrated that the
proposed on-device federated learning approach can produce a merged
model by integrating trained results from multiple edge devices as
accurately as BP-NN3, BP-NN5, and BP-NN3-FL.
Please note that the proposed approach is one-shot, which is favorable
especially in the federated learning settings since the number of
communication rounds significantly affects the
communication cost.
As a future work, we will explore client selection strategies for our
approach in order to further improve the accuracy and efficiency.
