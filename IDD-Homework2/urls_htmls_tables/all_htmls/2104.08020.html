<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning methodology that allows multiple clients (i.e., workers) to collaboratively train statistical models without disclosing private training data. Due to the characteristics of data remaining localized and the uninspected on-device training process, there may exist Byzantine workers launching data poisoning and model poisoning attacks, which would seriously deteriorate model performance or prevent the model from convergence. Most of the existing Byzantine-robust FL schemes are either ineffective against several advanced poisoning attacks or need to centralize a public validation dataset, which is intractable in FL. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing Byzantine-robust distributed learning methods could well exert its power in Non-Independent and Identically distributed (Non-IID) data among clients. To address these issues, we propose FedCom, a novel Byzantine-robust federated learning framework by incorporating the idea of commitment from cryptography, which could achieve both data poisoning and model poisoning tolerant FL under practical Non-IID data partitions. Specifically, in FedCom, each client is first required to make a commitment to its local training data distribution. Then, we identify poisoned datasets by comparing the Wasserstein distance among commitments submitted by different clients. Furthermore, we distinguish abnormal local model updates from benign ones by testing each local model’s behavior on its corresponding data commitment. We conduct an extensive performance evaluation of FedCom. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust schemes in defending against typical data poisoning and model poisoning attacks under practical Non-IID data distributions.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional machine learning paradigm requires centralizing a massive amount of data from a number of mobile users (i.e., clients) to a central server, which raises serious privacy concerns. The recently emerging federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning methodology that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train statistical models under the orchestration of a central server while keeping data localized. Typically, the workflow of FL is as follows. The clients download the latest global model from the server. Then, each client performs local model update using her private training data and uploads the updated model parameters to the server. Finally, the server aggregates the received information and updates the global model. The above steps are repeated until the global model converges. FL could not only construct high-quality machine learning models but could also significantly mitigate privacy risks, thus attracting significant attention recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, since the server neither has access to clients’ private training data nor could inspect the distributed on-device training process in FL, there usually exist Byzantine workers launching data poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and model poisoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> attacks. Data poisoning attacks refer to fabricating or falsifying training samples, which induces an abnormal training process and leads to poisoned local models. Model poisoning attacks represent that Byzantine workers directly modify the local model updates. It is worth noting that the essence of these two kinds of attacks is to generate a poisoned local model and make it be aggregated when the server updates the global model. Without effective strategies for defending against these attacks or Byzantine-robust FL schemes, the global model’s performance would drastically deteriorate, or the global model would not converge. To address this issue, researchers have proposed several Byzantine-robust FL approaches. Existing Byzantine-robust FL schemes could be generally grouped into two categories. We name one <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> as Distance Statistical Aggregation (DSA), as such schemes assume that poisoning local models obtain great distances from other benign local models, and remove statistical outliers before using them to aggregate a global model. We name the other <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> as Contribution Statistical Aggregation (CSA), as such schemes give priority to local models which contribute the most to global model’s accuracy or global model’s convergence. The basic principle of these two kinds of methods is that instead of performing model averaging when updating the global model, the server would first try to identify the poisoned local model updates and exclude them from local models aggregation or perform quality-aware local model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, existing Byzantine-robust FL schemes have performance limitations from the following three perspectives. First, the DSA mechanisms work under the strict assumption that the poisoned local models submitted by Byzantine workers are statistically far away from the local models from benign workers. However, the recently proposed attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> could generate poisoned local models statistically close to benign models and could circumvent the DSA schemes. Second, the CSA methods require collecting a public validation dataset before the training starts, which is intractable and unpractical in FL, as clients are unwilling to share their private data due to privacy concerns. Finally, most of the existing Byzantine-robust FL schemes are ineffective when data is non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) among clients, which is usually the case in reality as different users bear different device usage patterns. The reason is that the local models updated based on Non-IID data among different clients are pretty different from each other, making it even more challenging to distinguish poisoned local models from benign ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the issues mentioned above, we propose FedCom in this paper. FedCom is a novel Byzantine-robust federated learning framework, which could achieve both data poisoning and model poisoning tolerant FL under practical Non-IID data distribution among clients, by incorporating the idea of commitment from cryptography. The core idea of commitment is ”blind verification”: integrity of localized data or process could be verified without disclosing any of it. If there is an effective mean of committing local data’s distribution in FL, then we could indirectly inspect local datasets or local training processes. Specifically, in FedCom, each client is first required to make a commitment to its local training data distribution. In more detail, data commitment is an artificial dataset which takes the average of a sample cluster in original dataset as a sample. The data commitment constructed in this way is empirically demonstrated to subject to the similar data distribution to the original dataset, without disclosing any samples in it. Then, the central server identifies poisoned datasets by comparing the Wasserstein distance among commitments submitted by different clients. This is because an effective data poisoning attacks usually manipulate the data distribution, and there may obtain significant Wasserstein distance between manipulated distribution and benign one. Furthermore, we consider obvious asynchronous progress of a local model’s convergence relative to others as dishonesties, and distinguish them from benign ones via testing each local model on its corresponding data commitment, and accordingly adjust the weights of different local models when conducting local models aggregation at the server.</p>

Specifically, we first present the idea of data commitment by introducing a toy example. Then, we illustrate how to defend against local model poisoning attacks based on the submitted commitment. Finally, we present the detailed design on how to thwart local data poisoning attacks. We would like to point out that throughout the design of FedCom, we focus on a practical case, where the data among workers is Non-IID.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Under condition that local datasets are Non-IID, common assumption that benign local models are statistically similar is disabled. Hence, the most effective mean of defending poisoning attacks in FL could be inspecting local datasets and local training processes, without directly insulting user’s privacy. Recall common cryptographic tools like hash function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and consider the game below: Alice and Bob are playing guessing game, in which player gives a bigger number wins the game. Assume that the number is public once given, and we can’t ensure two players giving their numbers simultaneously. Obviously, once a player gives the first number, the other player could simply win the game by giving the second number bigger than the first one. We could use hash function to fix the bug: both two players should firstly give a hash digest of the numbers they are giving, and give the original number after two digests are given. The hash digest will not match if anyone changed the original number after giving the digest, and it is almost impossible for other players to infer the original number from hash digest. As a result, we have a simple way to check if players have changed the numbers without knowing them. This is the basic idea of commitment system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> in cryptography. Back to our task, if we could construct commitments for local datasets without disclosing any sample, and verify local training processes using such commitments, then we could provide an indirect mechanism to detect dishonest local training process. In such a mechanism, whether a local model is trained honestly could be only verified by corresponding commitment, which may have no concern with Non-IID between local datasets.</p>

Data commitment does not disclose any original training samples, but subjects to the same distribution to original training dataset. Obviously, poisoning local datasets (gray circles) obtain data commitment that is geometrically ”far away” from other data commitments (white circles), hence obtain a low DC. Obviously, a model’s performance on original local datasets should be close to that on corresponding commitment datasets, otherwise model may not fit the original local dataset, hence obtain a low TC.</figcaption>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since data among workers is usually non-IID in practical FL systems, we employ two non-IID datasets for performance evaluation, i.e., Human Activity Recognition (HAR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and Non-IID MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. HAR is a dataset of motion data sampled from motion sensors of smart phones, containing 561-feature sample vectors with time and frequency domain variables and 6 different labels (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying). Data in HAR is partitioned by different users, and is naturally Non-IID due to user’s different physical conditions. We randomly select 20 users’ dataset and assign them to workers as local datasets. MNIST is a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, which consists of 60000 training samples and 10000 testing samples, and each samples is a 28*28 gray-level image. We follow the method in LotteryFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to generate a non-IID data partition using the standard MNIST dataset. Specifically, we choose ”n-class &amp; unbalanced” setting: each partition contains 10-class training data, and these classes obtain biased feature across the partitions. The volume of each class is unbalanced, and samples are insufficient. Then, we randomly choose 20 local datasets and assign them to workers. Note that the non-IID data distribution in HAR is due to the slightly different physical conditions of volunteers, and thus the non-IID degree is relatively low. In contrast, the processed MNIST data presents a relatively high level of non-IID, as each worker possessed a data partition with biased class distribution or unbalance.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the machine learning models used in the experiments, we consider both convex and non-convex models. Specifically, we employ a multi-class logistic regression and a deep neural network (DNN). For DNN, we set a hidden layer of 150 neurons and a output layer with Sigmoid function. We adopt Adam with default hyperparameters as optimizer for LR and DNN. It should be noted that our experiment should be focused on performance of other baseline aggregation rules and FedCom facing different poisoning attacks, rather than the best model or hyperparameters for HAR or MNIST. Hence, we do not have to use models with excessive complexity.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Impact of Non-IID</span>: note that the Non-IID feature of two datasets negatively impacts the accuracy of global models. Local datasets of workers in our evaluation are randomly chosen and assigned to workers from a batch of local datasets, and neither of the global data distributions of two datasets are intact. Hence, the accuracy of global models on testing sets may not reach to a definite favourable level. However, it has nothing to do with comparing robustness between four aggregation rules. The results of all aggregation rules meet the expectation. Firstly, for <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span>, the Non-IID local datasets will significantly reduce the accuracy of global model, as global model under <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> is the closest local model to other models in the majority group, and a global model which overfits a certain local dataset will fit other local datasets well, hence will not obtain favourable performance on global validation set. By contrast, FedCom, <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAverage</span> and <em id="S4.SS2.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Multi-</em><span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> maintain or inherit the weighted average mechanism in <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAverage</span>, hence obtain better performance on Non-IID local datasets. Secondly, for HAR and MNIST that both of them obtain deletion of global data distribution, global model’s accuracy on HAR could relatively higher than that on MNIST, and this is because the Non-IID degree of HAR is smaller than that of MNIST, which also means that the bias degree of local models is smaller, hence the global model’s accuracy is better.</p>

Under Gaussian attack, global models obtain decay of accuracy on benign validation sets. under Label-filpping attack, the accuracy on label-flipped datasets rises up, and accuracy on benign validation set decreases. Such phenomenon meets our expectation, as <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAverage</span> is proved to obtain no Byzantine robustness. By contrast, other three aggregation rules all perform various degree of robustness.

Global models under <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> obtain unstable performance facing two attacks, but we consider such phenomenon rational, as <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> may select different local model as global model under different percentage of poisoning model, and different local model performs differently on benign validation set due to Non-IID local datasets. Nevertheless, the performance of global models under <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> is never worse than that when there is no attack, and this could reflect the robustness of <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span>. When facing Label-flipping attack, three robust aggregation rules could constrain the accuracy of global models on label-flipped dataset to a certain low rate, which means that local models trained by label-flipped local datasets are almost isolated from global model’s aggregation. It is shown that the naive poisoning attacks we implemented are correct, and FedCom, <em id="S4.SS3.p2.1.10" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Multi-</em><span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> obtain different levels of poisoning attack robustness.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Impact of Non-IID</span>: we need to note that the degree of Non-IID will impact the effectiveness of poisoning attacks. For Gaussian attack, we could observe that the accuracy of global model on MNIST under <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAverage</span> obtains larger percentage of decay than that on HAR. For example, LR under <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAverage</span> facing Gaussian attack obtains decay of accuracy on MNIST at percentage of 45.12%, and this percentage on HAR is only 27.17%. This indicates that higher degree of Non-IID makes Gaussian attack more effective. Such phenomenon could be rationally explained: a higher degree of Non-IID of local datasets makes benign local models more dispersive, and the length of benign global gradient aggregated by these benign models is shorterFor poisoning models, a shorter benign global gradient length could make manipulating the direction of final global gradient easier. Such phenomenon also occurs in Label-flipping attack, and explanation above is also appropriate.

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Impact of Krum attack</span>: First of all, we could easily summarize that under <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> or <em id="S4.SS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Multi-</em><span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span>, Krum attack could significantly reduce the accuracy of global models on benign validation set, hence, the Krum attack we implement is correct. Krum attack is specifically aimed at similar schemes like <em id="S4.SS4.p2.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Multi-</em><span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> or <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span>, but Krum attack is also claimed to obtain generality to <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAverage</span>. Our evaluation also prove that Krum attack could also reduce the performance of global model under <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAverage</span>. The results are also indicate that
a higher level of Non-IID will brings a better effectiveness of Krum attack, and such phenomenon meets the expectation of Krum attack’s original design. Concretely, Krum attack’s effectiveness on HAR is relatively weaker, but we consider this is the result of lower degree of Non-IID that could make it easier for benign local models to correct the manipulated direction of global model. In a word, Krum attack’s effectiveness meets our expectation. However, the results indicates that Krum attack is almost ineffective to FedCom, as global model’s accuracy on benign validation set maintains the same high level as when there is no attack. Hence, we could consider that FedCom obtains better robustness than schemes like <em id="S4.SS4.p2.1.10" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Multi-</em><span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> or <span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Impact of Back-gradient attack</span>: in original Back-gradient attack, attacker need to randomly select samples from benign dataset as seeds, and flip their labels before processing these samples using back-gradient algorithm. In other word, the original Back-gradient attack is a Label-flipping-based attack, which adopts crafty back-gradient optimization algorithm to amplify the effectiveness of poisoning samples. We believe that such process is conspicuous, just like Label-flipping attack, as directions of poisoning local models trained by these poisoning datasets will be definitely opposite to that of correct global model. To weaken such conspicuousness, and distinguish Back-gradient attack from Label-flipping attack, we maintain the original labels of seeds in this attack. This is to ensure poisoning samples obtain furthest biases from original data distribution, and avoid directly ”crossing” the decision boundary. We take MNIST as example and show partial poisoning samples in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-D Results for Advanced Poisoning Attacks ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ FedCom: A Byzantine-Robust Local Model Aggregation Rule Using Data Commitment for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. These examples intuitively indicates that the Back-gradient attack could significantly change the data distribution. The results in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-D Results for Advanced Poisoning Attacks ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ FedCom: A Byzantine-Robust Local Model Aggregation Rule Using Data Commitment for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> indicates that compared with Label-flipping attack, such an attack could successfully disable <em id="S4.SS4.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Multi-</em><span id="S4.SS4.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> or <span id="S4.SS4.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span>, as global models under these aggregation rules obtains decay of accuracy on benign validation set, as well as rise of accuracy on back-gradient poisoning datasets. <span id="S4.SS4.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedAverage</span> is with no exception. The effectiveness of attack could amplify with a rising percentage of poisoning workers, which also meets the expectation. We could also reach that Back-gradient attack is more destructive on MNIST. Concretely, the accuracy on poisoning dataset could indicate the degree global model fits poisoning data distribution, and it is obvious that model on HAR fits poisoning distribution better, but obtain smaller performance decay than model on MNIST. In other word, global model on MNIST may obtain worse performance even with a smaller degree of overfitting poisoning data distribution. Hence, Back-gradient attack could be more effective with higher degree of Non-IID. However, no matter whether attackers submit an honestly constructed commitment, and no matter what the degree of Non-IID or percentage of poisoning workers is, the accuracy of global model under FedCom maintains a similar high level as when there is no attack, and the rise of that on Back-gradient poisoning set could be neglected.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The privacy and secure problem of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> attracts widespread attention recently, and many related works are proposed, many of which are closely related to our work.
<span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Poisoning attack</span>: in FL, poisoning attacks aim to obtain wrong global models via manipulating local training datasets (LDP) or local models (LMP), and try to make users use such models to perform inference tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. LDP has been much explored, which usually launch attack by constructing malicious samples into training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. LDP could be divide into targeted LDP and untargeted LDP, in which untargeted LDP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is to make global model perform worse on general validation set, while targeted LDP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> is to make global model perform worse on specific subtasks, and perform normally on other subtasks. Some of these targeted LDP attacks are also known as <em id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdoor attacks</em>. LMP is not wildly explored, but recently proposed work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> gives novel idea of jamming the training process of FL, even if the aggregation rule is claimed to be Byzantine-robust. Note that backdoor attacks in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> could also be sorted into LMP, as local models with backdoors needs to be trained by manipulated local datasets, but such an attack also requires a certain strategy of model replacement, which is to inject local model with backdoor into model aggregation when global loss is almost convergent.</p>

Some Byzantine-robust aggregation rules concretize such assumption: benign local model holds majority in all local models, and distance between two benign models is smaller than that between benign one and poisoned one, because benign local models are honestly trained on similar local datasets. <span id="S5.p2.10.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">Krum</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is one of representative aggregation rules based on such an assumption.

However, such schemes could be infeasible in federated learning, because they depends on an effective public validation set to determine contribution of local models. First of all, forming such a dataset by IID sampling violates the principle of federated learning that user’s training dataset remains well-preserved privacy. Secondly, forming such a dataset by workers’ negotiation about public knowledge could be difficult, as workers could only reach consensus on the ”overlapping” parts of local datasets, but Non-IID data circumstance in federated learning makes local datasets ”overlap” slightly, or even completely ”separated”. In conclusion, the restriction of sampling and Non-IID data circumstance of federated learning could make schemes based on ERR of LFR ineffective.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we borrowed the idea of commitment from cryptography, and proposed a data commitment based Byzantine-robust FL framework which could simultaneously defend against data poisoning and model poisoning attacks even when data among workers is non-IID. By requiring each involved worker to submit a data commitment via sample cluster averaging to her private training data, the proposed FedCom could defend against data poisoning attacks by comparing the Wasserstein distance among the data commitments, and thwart model poisoning attacks by evaluating the behavior of different local models using the corresponding data commitment and conducting a behavior-aware local model aggregation. We conduct an exhaustive performance evaluation of FedCom. The experimental results demonstrate that FedCom outperforms the state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust FL schemes in defending against typical data poisoning and model poisoning attacks under practical non-IID data distribution among workers. Note that we mainly focus on non-targeted attacks in this work, while in the future work we will investigate how to achieve robust FL when backdoor (targeted) poisoning attacks happen.</p>
