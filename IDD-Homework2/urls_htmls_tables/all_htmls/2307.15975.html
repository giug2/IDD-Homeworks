<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Given the revolutionary role of metaverses, healthcare metaverses are emerging as a transformative force, creating intelligent healthcare systems that offer immersive and personalized services. The healthcare metaverses allow for effective decision-making and data analytics for users. However, there still exist critical challenges in building healthcare metaverses, such as the risk of sensitive data leakage and issues with sensing data security and freshness, as well as concerns around incentivizing data sharing. In this paper, we first design a user-centric privacy-preserving framework based on decentralized Federated Learning (FL) for healthcare metaverses. To further improve the privacy protection of healthcare metaverses, a cross-chain empowered FL framework is utilized to enhance sensing data security. This framework utilizes a hierarchical cross-chain architecture with a main chain and multiple subchains to perform decentralized, privacy-preserving, and secure data training in both virtual and physical spaces. Moreover, we utilize Age of Information (AoI) as an effective data-freshness metric and propose an AoI-based contract theory model under Prospect Theory (PT) to motivate sensing data sharing in a user-centric manner. This model exploits PT to better capture the subjective utility of the service provider. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes for healthcare metaverses.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The recent COVID‑19 pandemic has increased the demand for remote healthcare services<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. With the maturation and applications of metaverse technologies<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, digital healthcare has undergone a revolution, acting as a key force of healthcare industry evolution<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Unlike traditional videoconferencing-based telemedicine systems, healthcare metaverses are regarded as the future continuum between healthcare industries and metaverses, which blend physical and virtual spaces and break spatial and temporal barriers, providing immersive and interactive healthcare services that meet individual needs of users (e.g., patients or medical staff) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. By collaboratively utilizing cutting-edge technologies, such as blockchain<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and digital twins<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, healthcare metaverses have the potential to cover various applications, such as virtual comparative scanning and metaversed medical intervention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. To build a healthcare metaverse, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices (e.g., wearable devices and embedded medical devices carried by users) play an important role in communication and networking. For example, IoMT devices can collect a large amount of patients’ medical data (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram) to bridge the physical space and virtual spaces, providing patients with optimal treatment strategies based on the analysis and diagnosis of multiple patients’ attributes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the healthcare metaverse holds great potential for transforming the healthcare ecosystem, this technology still faces many challenges. There are some challenging bottlenecks for future popularization and development:
1) The healthcare metaverse risks user privacy leaks. Due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share private sensitive data in healthcare metaverses<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which hinders significant data analysis like pharmacodynamic analysis by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for healthcare improvement. 2) Sensing data suffers from being modified or tampered with by attackers in healthcare metaverses. Since users could have limited power in controlling their data sharing with whom and under what conditions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the collected data are not safe in healthcare metaverses, and the incorrect or manipulated data being analyzed will cause serious consequences<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. 3) Due to the energy constraints of IoMT devices, users may not join metaverses or provide fresh data without a proper incentive mechanism. Since the timeliness of healthcare data can affect diagnostic results, fresh sensing data are extremely important to enhance the quality of healthcare metaverse services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is necessary to design a user-centric incentive mechanism for incentivizing users with fresh data in healthcare metaverses. Some efforts have been conducted for incentivizing users with data sharing<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, but they ignore data freshness and the problem of information asymmetry.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above challenges, in this paper, we first apply FL and cross-chain technologies to design a user-centric privacy-preserving framework for sensing data sharing in healthcare metaverses<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, in which FL technologies can provide privacy protection for users<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and blockchain technologies can ensure data security for users and efficiently solve the problem of the single point of failure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Especially, the blockchain-based healthcare metaverse
enables users to access any digital space without the involvement of any central institution, which enhances the scalability of the healthcare metaverse<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To improve the service quality of healthcare metaverses, we utilize Age of Information (AoI) as a data-freshness metric to quantify sensing data freshness for healthcare metaverse services. Then, with asymmetric information, we design an AoI-based contract model to incentivize fresh data sharing among users. Considering that a service provider (i.e., an FL task publisher) may behave irrationally when facing uncertain and risky circumstances<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, we utilize Prospect Theory (PT) to capture the subjective utility of the service provider, which makes the AoI-based contract model more reliable in practice, and ultimately formulate the subjective utility as the goal function of the model<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the help of high-quality immersive content and gamification features, the healthcare metaverse can increase user engagement. For example, it can help clinicians explain complex concepts to patients, provide walk-throughs of the procedures that their patients will receive, and ensure that patients take their prescribed medications accurately<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.

Additionally, relying on encryption technologies and consensus algorithms of distributed systems, blockchain as a distributed ledger technology can effectively solve the problem of security vulnerabilities caused by centralized nodes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.

However, most works only consider a complete information scenario and ignore the problem of information asymmetry. Contract theory is a powerful tool for incentive mechanism design under information asymmetry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which has been applied in wireless communication areas<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.

Therefore, we focus on designing a contract-based incentive mechanism with optimal data freshness. AoI has been commonly used as an effective metric to
quantify data freshness at the destination. It is defined as the elapsed time from
the generation of the latest received status update, and its minimization depends on the status update frequency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.

scheme based on contract theory that can be calibrated to the model owner’s weighted preferences for the AoI and the service latency. However, none of the existing work takes the healthcare metaverse scenario into account. Therefore, it

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the healthcare metaverse, a virtual IoMT node is constructed by mapping and synchronizing the data of a physical IoMT node to the virtual space<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The virtual space is established on collected data from physical IoMT nodes and online generated data during node interaction and data analysis<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, due to privacy concerns, users may not be willing to upload all privacy-sensitive data to the healthcare metaverse directly. Thus, the datasets of virtual nodes are incomplete.

To this end, a user-centric privacy-preserving training framework is designed for healthcare metaverses, where users can customize uploading non-sensitive sensing data to virtual spaces for learning-based metaverse tasks and applications, and keep sensitive sensing data (e.g., heartbeats and chronic conditions) locally in the physical space for strong privacy protection<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>

In this paper, we define AoI as the time elapsed from the beginning of data aggregation by deployed IoMT devices to the completion of FL-based training, and the service latency as the time elapsed from the initiation of the FL training request to the completion of FL-based training. We focus on the AoI and the service latency of FL with a data caching buffer in workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, where the low AoI determines the high quality of FL-based training for reliable healthcare metaverse services. Without loss of generality, we consider that a model training request arrives at the beginning of each epoch<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to the conventional decision theory, the service provider is always rational and optimizes the decision-making process to maximize its own utility based on Expected Utility Theory (EUT), which uses objective probabilities to determine the weight of each possible payoff <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.
However, in an uncertain and risky environment, the service provider may behave irrationally and prefer to adjust original decisions in a predefined manner. Therefore, EUT is not applicable to capture risk attitudes of the service provider during the uncertain decision-making process. In the next subsection, we use both EUT and PT to capture the utility of the service provider. Firstly, we introduce the effect of two key notions from PT, i.e., <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">probability weighting</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">utility framing</span>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">1) Probability weighting effect:</em> Different from EUT, PT uses a subjective probability to determine the weight of each possible payoff. The subjective probability is a function in terms of the objective probability, which illustrates that high probability events are underestimated and low probability events are overestimated<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.12" class="ltx_p"><em id="S4.SS3.p3.12.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">2) Utility framing effect:</em> PT utilizes a reference point to frame the payoff of each outcome into either gain or loss. For instance, the service provider defines the goal of earning a specific amount of profits as its reference point. If its goal is not reached, it will perceive that it is a non-positive loss.

<p id="S4.SS4.p3.2" class="ltx_p">However, when facing uncertain and risky circumstances, the service provider may behave irrationally and have different risk attitudes. Therefore, EUT is not applicable to capture risk attitudes of the service provider during the uncertain decision-making process. In this paper, we utilize PT to further capture the utility of the service provider, which makes the contract model more acceptable in practice.

The reason is that the service provider knows the exact type information of workers and thus offers the most suitable contract item for each worker. Besides, the service provider under the CS mechanism gets a lower utility than that under the proposed CA mechanism. The reason is that the CS mechanism tends to maximize social welfare so that it reaches a balance between the utility of the service provider and that of workers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. In summary, our proposed CA mechanism allows the service provider to achieve the highest utility under asymmetric information.
Although the SG mechanism aims at maximizing the objective utilities of both the service provider and workers, the service provider under the SG mechanism gets the lowest utility. The reason is that for all types of workers, the SG mechanism allows only the workers with the highest four types to participate in the FL task under the Nash equilibrium<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.

We can find that the workers have the highest utility under the CS mechanism and the lowest utility under the CC mechanism. Moreover, the utilities of workers under the SG mechanism are between the utilities of the proposed CA mechanism and the CC mechanism. These results further indicate that our proposed CA mechanism has the highest performance under asymmetric information.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied user privacy protection issues and incentive mechanism design for healthcare metaverses. We have proposed a user-centric privacy-preserving framework based on FL technologies for data training in both the virtual space and the physical space of the healthcare metaverse. To ensure secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving model training, we have designed a decentralized FL architecture based on cross-chain technologies, which consists of a main chain and multiple subchains. Additionally, to improve the service quality of time-sensitive learning tasks, we have applied the AoI as a data-freshness metric and designed an AoI-contract model for incentivizing fresh sensing data sharing in a user-centric manner. Furthermore, we have utilized PT to capture the utility of the service provider considering decision-making under risks and uncertainty. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the incentive mechanism and the proposed cross-chain empowered FL framework for healthcare metaverses. For future work, we will further enhance the security and performance of our proposed cross-chain empowered FL framework by considering specific features of health data for healthcare metaverses. Besides, we will use AI tools like deep reinforcement learning or the diffusion model to enhance the solution methodology of the AoI-based contract model under PT.</p>
