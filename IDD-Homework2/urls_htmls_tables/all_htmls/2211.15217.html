<p id="id3.3" class="ltx_p">The preservation, monitoring, and control of water resources has been a major challenge in recent decades. Water resources must be constantly monitored to know the contamination levels of water. To meet this objective, this paper proposes a water monitoring system using autonomous surface vehicles, equipped with water quality sensors, based on a multimodal particle swarm optimization, and the federated learning technique, with Gaussian process as a surrogate model, the AquaFeL-PSO algorithm. The proposed monitoring system has two phases, the exploration phase and the exploitation phase. In the exploration phase, the vehicles examine the surface of the water resource, and with the data acquired by the water quality sensors, a first water quality model is estimated in the central server. In the exploitation phase, the area is divided into action zones using the model estimated in the exploration phase for a better exploitation of the contamination zones. To obtain the final water quality model of the water resource, the models obtained in both phases are combined. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed path planner in obtaining water quality models of the pollution zones, with a 14<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> improvement over the other path planners compared, and the entire water resource, obtaining a 400<math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mo id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> better model, as well as in detecting pollution peaks, the improvement in this case study is 4,000<math id="id3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id3.3.m3.1a"><mo id="id3.3.m3.1.1" xref="id3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id3.3.m3.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="id3.3.m3.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id3.3.m3.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math>.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Water is the source of life. Although it is a renewable resource, it is becoming increasingly scarce worldwide. Fresh water reservoirs are being polluted by domestic and industrial effluents and fertilizers from agricultural activities, among other causes. These problems not only affect the quality of life of human beings but also affect the planet. In 2015, at the United Nations Summit, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was approved<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://sdgs.un.org/es/goals</span></span></span>. The said document sets out 17 sustainable development goals and 169 targets to help people, the planet and prosperity. Among the 17 goals, the sixth one has water and sanitation as its main objectives. Reducing pollution, efficient use of water resources, water management, and the development of water-related programs are some of the pathways to achieve this goal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A necessary method to control the progress of actions taken to reduce pollution in water resources is monitoring the water quality of the water body. Water bodies that are constantly threatened must be monitored on a permanent basis. A prime example where contamination is always being studied and monitored is the Ypacarai lake in Paraguay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The main cause of contamination is the domestic and industrial effluents that flow into the lake and its watersheds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. As a consequence, the levels of fecal coliforms and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrate are high. High levels of nutrients cause the appearance of cyanobacteria <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This problem affects public health, the economy of the region, and the ecosystem in and around the lake.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional method of monitoring water quality consists of taking water samples at specific points in the water resource and analyzing those samples in specialized laboratories. This method can be exhaustive, time-consuming, human error can occur, and the costs of hiring personnel and equipment can be high <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. New technologies, such as aquatic submarines, surface vehicles, or aerial drones equipped with sensors capable of measuring water parameters, are currently being widely studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This work focuses on the guidance system. The guidance system is responsible for generating the path that autonomous vehicles have to travel, and the speed at which they have to go. One such algorithm that is being widely studied and used as a path planner is the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The PSO is a Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithm that is able to work with several agents/particles. The PSO is a simple metaheuristic algorithm to implement and does not have many parameters that need to be adjusted. The disadvantages of the PSO are the difficulty of initialing the configuration parameters and the ease with which particles get stuck in a local optimum. The monitoring system of a water resource can be considered a multimodal problem, because several pollution zones or several pollution peaks can be found in the water resource, whether global or local.
Because of this, a solution is to develop an informative path planner. The informative path planner is a type of path planner that composes the guidance system. The informative path planner has the advantage that it makes use of the water samples taken during the travel of the ASVs for the generation of the path. With the data obtained, the monitoring system can generate an estimated water quality model using machine learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In this work, a multimodal PSO-based informative path planning is developed for ASVs, using Gaussian Process (GP) as the underlying model. The monitoring task is divided into two phases, the exploration phase and the exploitation phase. In the exploration phase, ASVs aim to cover the largest possible area of the water resource without focusing on a specific area, to obtain a reliable model of the water resource. In this phase, the centralized learning technique is applied. Obtaining this first model, the monitoring system moves on to the exploitation phase. In this second phase, action zones are determined, and these action zones are the areas of high levels of pollution. After determining the action zones, the vehicles are assigned to the zones detected in the exploration phase to exploit them in a distributed way and generate a second water resource model, the final estimated model. The model obtained in the exploitation phase is based on the data collected in the exploration phase plus the data acquired by the ASV(s) while exploiting the given action zone. As a consequence, a more detailed estimated water quality model is obtained. The main objective of this second phase is to obtain a good characterization of the contamination zones that were determined in the exploration phase. In the exploitation phase, the Federated Learning technique (FL) is used. In recent years, the FL technique has received a lot of attention and many studies have been conducted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. FL is a special category of Distributed Machine Learning (DML) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This technique alleviates the problem of heavy traffic of data in the central server by training the GP in the nodes of each action zone with data collected by the ASVs assigned to that area in the exploitation phase, by using the data from the exploration phase.</p>

This problem was modeled as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), in which an ASV must cover the largest possible area of the water resource. For this purpose, the authors have fixed beacons on the shore of the water body. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the authors extended the work by modifying the modeling of the monitoring problem. In this extension, the problem was modeled as the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP). The difference between the TSP and the CPP is that, in the latter, the vehicle can pass more than once through the beacons. As a consequence, this allows maximizing the exploration of the lake surface. A two-phase GA-based monitoring system was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the monitoring problem was modeled as a Markov Decision Problem. The authors have developed a DRL-based online global path planner for ASVs to patrol the Ypacarai lake. RGB images of the water resource are used to represent possible vehicle positions and states. The authors trained a Deep Q-learning method based on convolutional neural networks using a tailored reward function. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, the authors developed a multiagent monitoring system and used a centralized approach technique as an extension of their earlier work. The fleet was trained using a single neural network. The results showed that for the directed patrolling problem, the centralized approach is more efficient than distributed Q-learning. A comparison between GAs and DRL for monitoring problems through ASV can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The authors demonstrated that in a complex scenario, DRL achieves better results. However, for low dimensional scenarios, GAs can obtain more robust solutions. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors develop an informative path planning based on BO. The authors adapted the classical BO framework for water monitoring. The objective is to generate an estimated model of pollution in the Ypacarai lake. The authors compare different acquisition functions to determine the positions where water samples should be taken. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the authors extended the work by considering the monitoring problem as a multiobjective problem where several water quality parameters were taken into account simultaneously. In order to obtain the optimal positions for water sampling, the authors evaluated different multiobjective techniques to create an acquisition function that combines data from the water quality sensors. PSO-based path planners were developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the authors developed an informative path planner by combining the PSO components with the data obtained from the estimated water quality model generated by the GP. The authors compared the developed algorithm with other PSO-based algorithms in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, where in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the focus of the algorithm is to explore the surface of the water resource and obtain the most reliable estimated model of the lake, and in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> the focus is to exploit the area where the highest pollution peak of Ypacarai lake is located.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the limitations of the classical PSO for multimodal problems, different methods and strategies were implemented such as mutation mechanism, dynamic parameters, neighborhood techniques, among others. One of the methods studied by researchers to improve the PSO is the mutation method. The main idea is to improve the classical PSO by including mutation operators to preserve population diversity and overcome the problem of premature convergence. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a dynamic inertia weight to obtain an efficient balance between exploration and exploitation, and a mutation mechanism to diversify particles in the optimization process. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the authors employ three mutation strategies, Gaussian, Cauchy, and Lévy, to perform mutation on the local best and global best. The best mutation is selected according to the selection ratio of each mutation operator. The results show that not all types of problems can be effectively solved by one type of mutation operator. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the authors develop a niching strategy to ensure population diversity. The authors connect each particle with its better in its neighborhood and create a raw species. Then, the dominant raw species are combined to generate the final species of the population.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Multimodal problems can also be solved using neighborhood information. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed a dynamic <math id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math>-neighborhood selection mechanism. The size of the neighborhood changes dynamically for each particle. In addition, the authors developed four different position-update strategies in which the particle position is updated according to the particle position and the behavior in its neighborhood. The results show that the proposed algorithm solves multimodal problems. However, it shows that it does not effectively solve high-dimensional multimodal problems. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the global learning strategy is replaced by a dynamic neighborhood-based learning strategy. The velocity of each particle is updated with its best position and the best position of its neighborhood. In addition, the authors include an offspring competition mechanism to improve the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the author divided the particle swarm into several subpopulations based on the order of the particles. The main idea is to replace the best position of the swarm with the best position of the subpopulation. Then, the particle velocity is updated with its best position and the best position of the subpopulation. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, the concept of a subpopulation was also applied. The author develops an improvement to the PSO by dividing the swarm into two large groups, where one group focuses on the search for the global maximum and the other group on the global minimum. These two large groups are then divided into several subgroups. As in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the particle velocity is updated using the best position of the subpopulation instead of the best position of the whole population. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, the authors introduce a new cluster-based PSO that includes a leader updating mechanism and a ring topology. For subpopulation evolution, the global best PSO is used, and to improve the information interaction between subpopulations, a local best PSO with ring topology is adopted, which improves exploration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several strategies have been developed to improve the performance of the classical PSO. A self-adaptive PSO is developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. To avoid getting stuck in local optima, the two acceleration coefficients of the PSO are dynamically modified at each iteration taking into account the Euclidean distance between the current position of the particles and the best position of all particles (global best). In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, the authors also proposed dynamically updating the PSO coefficients, the inertia weight, and the stochastic acceleration or acceleration coefficients. In the search process, each particle has a different value of inertia weight, and the values of the stochastic accelerations are changed randomly. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors adopted the multimodal delayed information strategy to improve the PSO. The particle velocity is updated according to the previous velocity, the local and global best, and two new terms, the local and global delayed best. These terms correspond to the values of the previous stochastic iterations of the local and global best. The algorithm evaluates the evolution factor at each iteration and selects the indicated evolutionary states (convergence state, exploitation state, exploration state, and the state of jumping out). A memetic PSO is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. The authors combine the local PSO model and the Local Search (LS) method. The local PSO is used for global exploration of the search space, and for local exploitation, two different LS operators in a cooperative fashion are proposed. In addition, a method to trigger the reinitialization of the converged species is integrated.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This work fills several gaps with respect to previous approaches. First, previous works that focused on improving PSO-based path planners based on GP do not avoid local maximum/minimum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>; and also, they are not intended for multimodal scenarios. These works achieved satisfactory results in terms of model estimation but considered simple scenarios that only contain a global maximum. It can be expected in real scenarios that multiple contamination peaks are present. Second, none of the previous studies focused on multiagent systems for water monitoring applied federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. These works used centralized systems for developing the estimated contamination models. The research presented here is the first attempt at the application of federated learning for water monitoring through ASV. This simplifies the communication congestion between vehicles and the main server. Third, the proposed approach is a step forward in terms of model estimation with respect to the proposed techniques based on exploration and exploitation phases like epsilon greedy algorithm and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

The Ypacarai lake has two main inlets: 1) an inlet to the southeast, the Pirayú stream; and 2) an inlet to the northwest, the Yukyry stream. However, it also has other smaller inlets to the east and west of the lake. The lake has only one natural outlet, the Salado River, located north of the lake. The lake plays an important role in its environment; it is a source of water for the surrounding towns and farms, and the water is also used to irrigate the surrounding agricultural activities. During summer, the lake is used for recreational and tourist purposes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the pollution of the lake affects not only nature, but also public health and the surrounding economy. The main sources of lake contamination are domestic and industrial wastewater from surrounding towns, as well as fertilizer residues that reach the lake from crops through rain or streams <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Because of this, constant monitoring of the water quality of the lake is carried out by governmental and nongovernmental institutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The monitoring method applied is the traditional method, in which specialists take water samples at specific points around the lake and streams and analyze these samples in laboratories. Monitoring using ASV will allow not only to sample points around the lake, but also points all over the lake surface, allowing to obtain a more complete status of the water quality, to perform monitoring in less time and in a more efficient way.</p>

The concept of the algorithm was inspired by the social behavior of a school of fish and flocks of birds. The potential solutions of the optimization problem are called particles or individuals, and a group of particles is called swarm or population. The population of the PSO is initialized randomly. The particles travel in a multidimensional search space, sharing information with each other to expand the search area. Then, each particle follows a different path to reach the target. This allows more space to be covered to find the global optimum.

The main idea is that the classical PSO algorithm is enhanced by adding the mean and uncertainty components given by the GP. Therefore, the vehicle will move guided by four components, best local, best global, GP mean, GP uncertainty. The main components of the Enhanced GP-based PSO are described as follows.</p>

The input to the GP consists of a random data set. The GP is completely defined by two components: the covariance function or kernel and the mean function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the mean function is usually zero. For this monitoring system, the mean function is zero, so the component that defines the GP behavior in this algorithm is the kernel function. The kernel function specifies the smoothness, variability, and shape of the model of the water quality parameters of the water resource. According to the results obtained in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) has the best behavior for water resources.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main objective of this section is the development of an informative path planner based on a multimodal PSO, GP, and FL paradigm. The new monitoring system uses as a basis the Enhanced GP-based PSO (Sect. <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Enhanced GP-based PSO ‣ 4 PSO-based Path planners ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>). Improvements are added to increase accuracy and precision in detecting and monitoring areas of high contamination. The new improvement is based on dividing the monitoring system into two phases, exploration and exploitation. Contrary to the epsilon greedy method (Sec. <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Enhanced GP-based PSO based on Epsilon Greedy method ‣ 4 PSO-based Path planners ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>), in this new system, the phases have controlled periods.</p>

The objective of this first phase is to obtain a reliable water quality model to determine the areas of highest contamination of the water resource, which are called action zones. Then, when the distance traveled by the ASVs reaches a certain distance, called the exploration distance, the estimated water quality model is obtained with the samples taken in the exploration phase. Once the model is obtained, the system moves on to the exploitation phase. The exploitation phase consists of taking water quality samples in areas where the highest level of contamination is detected. In this second phase, the surface of the water resource is divided into action zones and the ASVs are assigned to these zones. Decision and assignment of ASVs are done only once. The ASVs are assigned according to the distance of the ASV from the center of the action zone. Once the ASVs are assigned, the vehicles go directly to the corresponding action zone and exploit it to obtain a more accurate model. Each action zone has its own estimated model, having as starting point the model obtained in the exploration phase. The vehicles finish the monitoring task when they reach a distance traveled equal to the exploitation distance. Finally, the estimated models are merged to obtain a single water quality model of the water resource. The values of exploration distance and exploitation distance are parameters that are set at the start of the algorithm.</p>

The procedure finishes when the maximum number of action zones is determined. The maximum number of action zones is the number of vehicles in the fleet. Notice that between the centers of two action zones, there will never be a distance smaller than the action radius because the center of the action zone is obtained considering the coordinates outside the circumference. As a consequence of the proposed procedure for determining the action zones, two cases can occur: 1) there can be fewer action zones than vehicles, this is because there are fewer pollution peaks than ASVs; 2) there can be the same number of action zones as vehicles, this is because there are the same number of pollution peaks as vehicles. In this work, it is not considered to have action zones than vehicles, since the number of pollution peaks is limited by the number of vehicles.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Once the action zones have been obtained, the vehicles are assigned to the action zones with the objective that ASVs exploit the zone. The ASVs are assigned according to the distance between the vehicle and the center of the action zone. The ASV that is closest to the action zone is the one that takes advantage of that zone. In case there are more ASVs than action zones, more than one vehicle is assigned in the action zones. The priority of the action zone is the condition to determine the assignment of the vehicles in this case. The priority of the action zones is determined by the peak contamination value of the action zone. Thus, the highest priority would be given to the action zone that has the highest peak contamination of the model estimated in the exploration phase. This parameter is used to assign vehicles to action zones in case there are more vehicles than action zones. The higher the priority of the action zone, the higher the probability that there will be more ASVs exploiting the area.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">After obtaining the action zones and assigning the ASVs, the actual exploitation task is conducted. By dividing the fleet into different action zones, the swarm is divided into subpopulations or multiple swarms. Each subpopulation focuses on the exploitation of its action zone, hence the maximum contamination and maximum uncertainty data are different for each subpopulation, as well as the global best. To calculate the maximum value of each action zone, only the data of the coordinates that are in that action zone are taken into account, discarding the other coordinates of the map. In this way, the exploitation of this action zone is not affected by the other action zones. Moreover, each subpopulation calculates a different global best; therefore, the global best of a subpopulation is the best position among the vehicles that are in the same action zone. If there is only one vehicle in the action zone, the global best is equal to the local best. To end with the monitoring, the vehicles must travel a certain distance, which is the exploitation distance.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To obtain the estimated water quality model of the water resource, the concept of a machine learning technique, Federated Learning (FL), is applied. The FL technique is a new concept that was introduced by McMahan et al., with the aim of updating language models in cell phones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. The idea of the FL is to generate an ensemble ML model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The data that are used to generate this model are scattered in multiple sites. These data are trained by the local servers or nodes, and the information that is shared with the central server is the result of the training. In this way, the security of the data of each node and the privacy of each node are preserved. The final result obtained in the central server is very similar to the final model generated by a system with a centralized learning technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In addition to promoting the privacy and security of the framework, nodes can train ML models in a collaborative manner, allowing better results to be generated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Among the drawbacks of the FL are: the communication between nodes and the central server can be unstable and slow; and the more nodes there are, the more likely the system will become unpredictable and unstable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

Therefore, the generation of the models is performed at each node or action zone. For the final water resource model, the results obtained at each node are replaced by the model generated in the exploration phase, at the central server. The data to be replaced are the mean and uncertainty values of the model obtained in the corresponding action zone.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The results that are compared between the path planners are the results obtained with the estimated model of the whole lake, the estimated model in the action zones, and the value obtained for the peaks of each action zone. For this purpose, the metrics used are the mean square error (MSE) for the estimated models; and the error between two points, for the value of the peaks of each action zone. The MSE has been selected because this metric is often used to analyze the results of regression models. To calculate the MSE of the action zones and the error in the maximum peaks, the action zones of the ground truth were considered. In other words, the division of the map into action zones was applied to the ground truth, since the ground truth is considered as the real model of the water quality of the Ypacarai lake. From these real action zones, the maximum peaks of real contamination were obtained. Then, the MSE and error were calculated taking into consideration the coordinates of the real contamination peaks and real contamination zones.</p>

When there are no limited factors, such as time and distance, this path planner is able to cover the entire surface of the lake. However, when considering a limited distance, the ASVs are not able to obtain enough samples to generate an accurate model, nor are they able to detect pollution peaks. This leads to large errors in the estimation of the water quality model. Fig. <a href="#S6.F13.sf2" title="In 6.3 Performance comparison ‣ 6 Simulation Results ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13(b)</span></a> represents the trajectories generated by the classical PSO. In the Classic PSO, the ASVs are guided by their own experience and by the experience of the other vehicles in the fleet, because of this, after some time, the vehicles are stuck in a local optimum, since they cannot explore the surface anymore. In this scenario, the influence of the global best on the vehicles at the bottom of the lake can be observed, where both vehicles are in contaminated areas. However, as another of the ASVs has found the maximum peak, the global best is the best position of that vehicle, and the ASVs that were at the bottom of the lake, instead of exploiting the area where they are positioned, go to the area where the maximum peak is located. In Fig. <a href="#S6.F13.sf3" title="In 6.3 Performance comparison ‣ 6 Simulation Results ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13(c)</span></a>, it is shown how ASVs explore the zones where uncertainty is high and are not guided by the zones where contamination is high. This is due to the values of the acceleration coefficients, and the terms that are active are the local best and the maximum uncertainty term. Due to the local best, the vehicles exploit the areas through which they pass, and thanks to the maximum uncertainty, the ASVs go to unexplored areas. This behavior allows to obtain a good water quality model of the water resource. On the other hand, it does not exploit the contamination zones, and as a consequence, a considerable error in the contamination peaks can be obtained. In contrast to Fig. <a href="#S6.F13.sf3" title="In 6.3 Performance comparison ‣ 6 Simulation Results ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13(c)</span></a>, in Fig. <a href="#S6.F13.sf4" title="In 6.3 Performance comparison ‣ 6 Simulation Results ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13(d)</span></a>, the movement of vehicles is shown by applying the Enhanced GP-based PSO focused on the exploitation of pollution zones.

At the beginning of the monitoring, the probability that the algorithm explores the surface is high.

That can be observed in Fig. <a href="#S6.F14.sf1" title="In Figure 14 ‣ 6.3 Performance comparison ‣ 6 Simulation Results ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14(a)</span></a>, as the ASVs target the area where the generated model estimates the maximum contamination point.

Since the system considers two phases in given periods, and the search space is divided into action zones as well as the fleet into subpopulations, it is possible to obtain an accurate model of the pollution zones and the whole lake. Moreover, the path planner is able to detect pollution peaks. After performing the explore of the surface of the lake, the model generated with the water samples is obtained, the model is as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F9.sf4" title="In 6.2.1 Action zone scalability and resource allocation ‣ 6.2 Proposed approach evaluation ‣ 6 Simulation Results ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(d)</span></a>.

Once the exploitation phase is completed, the algorithm proceeds to replace the results obtained from the action zones with the estimated model generated in the exploration phase, creating the final water quality model of the water resource shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F14.sf2" title="In Figure 14 ‣ 6.3 Performance comparison ‣ 6 Simulation Results ‣ AquaFeL-PSO: A Monitoring System for Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles based on Multimodal PSO and Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14(b)</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A water resource monitoring system for ASVs was developed and simulated in this paper. The designed monitoring system is based on a multimodal PSO and federated learning technique and uses the Gaussian process as a surrogate model. The objectives of the proposed monitoring system were to generate accurate estimated models of the contamination zones and the whole surface of the water resource, as well as the detection of contamination peaks. The AquaFeL-PSO algorithm has two phases, the exploration phase and the exploitation phase. In the exploration phase, the ASVs are dedicated to cover the surface of the water resource to obtain water samples from the water body and generate a first estimated water quality model. In the exploitation phase, using this first model generated, the surface of the water body is divided into action zones according to the length of the water resource and the number of vehicles in the fleet. Then, the ASVs are assigned to the action zones to carry out the exploitation of these areas. For the estimation of the water quality model of the action zones, the FL technique is used, which allows alleviating the data traffic between the nodes and the central server. Each action zone has its own node, and in each node the estimated model of that area is updated. Finally, when the monitoring task is completed, the models of the action zones are joined with the model obtained in the exploration phase to obtain the final water quality model of the water resource. It was demonstrated that with the AquaFeL-PSO it is possible to solve the multimodal problem of water resource monitoring. The proposed monitoring system was able to detect pollution peaks and obtain accurate estimated water quality models of the pollution zones and the entire surface of the water body. As future work, the monitoring system developed will be improved to be able to determine the speed and direction of movement of the contamination zones in dynamic environments. Furthermore, a multiobjective PSO will be employed to obtain multiple water quality parameter models simultaneously. Therefore, the federated learning approach will be extended to the estimation of multiple models.</p>

Having a fleet with two vehicles, in the three case studies, the path planner that obtained the best performance was the proposed path planner. Unlike the results obtained with four vehicles, the difference in errors is not so large. However, the MSE of the estimated model of the whole lake and the error in the pollution peaks are up to 4 times lower than the second best MSE and error. With respect to the results obtained with six ASVs, in the modeling of the action zones, with a very small difference, the proposed path planner obtained the second best performance, behind the epsilon greedy method. However, in the other two case studies, the AquaFeL-PSO algorithm performed the best. In the detection of pollution peaks, the second best result is almost 20 times higher than the error obtained with the AquaFeL-PSO algorithm, and in the generation of the estimated model of the whole lake, the second best MSE is about 200<math id="A1.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="A1.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="A1.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="A1.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A1.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="A1.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A1.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A1.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> higher than the MSE of the proposed monitoring system.</p>
