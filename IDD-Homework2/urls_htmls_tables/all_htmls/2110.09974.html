<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">How to tackle non-iid data is a crucial topic in federated learning. This challenging problem not only affects training process, but also harms performance of clients not participating in training. Existing literature mainly focuses on either side, yet still lacks a unified solution to handle these two types (internal and external) of clients in a joint way. In this work, we propose a unified framework to tackle the non-iid issues for internal and external clients together. Firstly, we propose to use client-specific batch normalization in either internal or external clients to alleviate feature distribution shifts incurred by non-iid data. Then we present theoretical analysis to demonstrate the benefits of client-specific batch normalization. Specifically, we show that
our approach promotes convergence speed for federated training and yields lower generalization error bound for external clients. Furthermore, we use causal reasoning to form a causal view to explain the advantages of our framework. At last, we conduct extensive experiments on natural and medical images to evaluate our method, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, faster convergence, and shows good compatibility. We also performed comprehensive analytical studies on a real-world medical dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) enables multiple institutions to collaboratively learn a joint global model without sharing data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
In FL, a common paradigm is federated averaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, in which clients train models locally and a server updates the global model by averaging parameters collected from the clients. While it has shown success in certain applications, recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> reveal that federated methods perform less well on non-iid (not independent and identically distributed) data, significantly suffering from degradation of training convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and generalization capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, designing new methods to tackle the data non-iid issue becomes imperative to unleash the potential of FL for real-world applications, in which the data are ordinarily not identically distributed, e.g., different imaging devices in healthcare, different environments (city, rural areas) for autonomous driving.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In FL systems, it is common that not all clients participate in the training process in each round. Some clients do not participate at all <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Current approaches to tackle non-iid data focus on those clients that either participate every round, or at least regularly during the training process – we call those <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">internal clients</span>. As we show in this paper, this, however, can deteriorate the performance on clients that do not participate in training – the <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">external clients</span>.
Recently, some federated generalization methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> propose to learn invariant features to improve the model generalization for external clients.
Though with generalizability promoted, these methods are specifically designed for external clients,
casting them to fit existing well-established FL algorithms would inevitably complicate the training process (e.g., sharing extra features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> or designing extra modules <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>).
Therefore, exploring a unified framework considering both internal and external clients becomes essential.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike most FL methods tackling non-iid data with label distribution shifts, we focus on the distribution shift in feature space. Non-iid image feature is a critical problem in real-world (medical imaging) and has not been fully studied in existing literature.
This type of non-iid data typically happens in cases where the local devices are responsible for heterogeneity in the feature distributions. For example, in cancer diagnosis, the appearance of images collected from different hospitals varies dramatically due to different scanner vendors and imaging protocols <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, even though they have uniformly distributed labels (i.e., the cancer types treated are quite similar across the hospitals).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the non-iid data with feature shifts, feature normalization has been explored in centralized setting in the context of domain adaptation and generalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. An effective approach is utilizing the Batch Normalization (BN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Besides benefit in generalization, it has also demonstrated potential in improving optimization in centralized training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
As an indispensable component of nearly all neural networks, BN can be readily composed in designing a unified framework, without complicating federated training or testing. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of BN layers in FL in order to assist in building a unified framework for non-iid features. However, either empirical study or theoretical analysis of BN in FL has not been fully studied yet.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Quite different from centralized paradigm, the unique property of distributed paradigm brings new challenges for analyzing models with BN layers in FL, including both training and testing stages.
First, analysis for model training becomes difficult, because model update in each global round is influenced by all intermediate model states of internal clients. Specifically, the estimation of global population statistics in BN is performed in a distributed manner by aggregating locally estimated statistics. For each client, the data samples drawn from local distribution are not well described by the global statistics, which incurs normalized feature distribution deviating from the standard distribution. This deviation subsequently results in divergence between local and global model weights, making the analysis for training dynamics non-trivial. Second, when deploying model for testing, a global model trained on heterogeneous feature distributions fails to be an accurate estimation for each specific client, and it is even worse if the testing client does not present during training at all, i.e., external clients. For external clients, using either global statistics or internal clients’ statistics for BN has a risk of improperly normalizing features, which deteriorates the final model prediction.How to measure the differences is crucial to understand and promote the expected performance for external clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The above-mentioned challenges are essentially coupled within BN, which should be handled jointly. In this paper, we present a unified framework (<span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">UniFed</span>) to solve these challenges together by proposing client-specific BN. Client-specific BN is a lightweight yet effective method that each internal/external client uses its own BN layers. Our insights come from the inconsistency of statistic estimation in BN layers, i.e., the inconsistent local and global estimations during federated training, and the inconsistent training and testing estimations for external client testing.
By decomposing and analyzing the effects of BN in these two scenarios, we show that client-specific BN, as one single solution, can well promote FL internally and externally in terms of model performance, convergence and generalization capability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">For internal clients, using client-specific BN can well capture local data distribution statistics, alleviating the weight divergence induced by improperly normalized features.
In our previous study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, we investigated the training dynamics of overparameterized neural networks with client-specific BN through the neural tangent kernel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. In this work, we further improve the theoretical demonstrations to show that using client-specific BN improves the convergence rate. Then we extend our previous work to external clients to form a unified framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">For external clients, due to the inconsistency between internal and external estimated statistics, using client-specific BN helps re-estimate statistics from external data. This re-estimation correlates external data distributions with its own statistics, thus promoting normalizing features into standard distribution. Such normalization well matches input space of other layers, effectively alleviating the model performance drop.
By analyzing the generalization error on external data distribution, we theoretically demonstrate that client-specific BN decreases the divergence between distributions of internal and external clients, yielding a lower generalization bound than vanilla BN.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, inspired by the resistance of human cognitive systems to feature distribution changes, we find humans immune to distribution changes because humans are more sensitive to causal relations than statistical associations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, we propose using causal reasoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> to form a causal viewpoint to explain the benefits of client-specific BN. By constructing causal graphs for federated training and testing, we interpret client-specific BN as a specific distribution change resulting from the intervention on client’s original feature distribution. This intervention helps identify causal relationships and omit nuisance factors (e.g., noises or different styles that usually make no impact on human decisions). The explanations integrate both federated training and testing stages, and well support our theoretical analysis on convergence rate and generalization error.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the theoretical analysis and explanations, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework UniFed. The client-specific BN in this framework can be seen as a lightweight add-on for standard FL algorithms. First, we show the good compatibility of our method by applying client-specific BN on many different FL algorithms designed for non-iid data, including methods targeted at improving the global model from either client-side or server-side, and a method that aims to learn personalized models for each client. Then, we show that our method significantly boosts the performance for both internal and external clients. At last, we perform analytical studies to investigate the key properties of client-specific BN. Our experiments are performed on two datasets: one benchmark dataset of natural images with 15 different feature distribution shifts and one large-scale real-world medical dataset containing 450,000 histology patches.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent FL studies have been increasingly investigating the issue of non-iid data distributions across different clients, from multiple aspects, such as federated training, client model personalization, and federated generalization. Most existing works aim to improve federated training, such as regularizing local model training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, facilitating model optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, enhancing aggregation algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, improving feature normalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, etc.
For example, as an early work, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> extends the conventional FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> by adding a proximal term to help regularize the client training. SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> suggests a new optimization algorithm to reduce variance for client drift in its local updates.
Later on, FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> proposes to use normalized stochastic gradients to perform global model aggregation rather than the cumulative raw local gradient changes; MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> proposes to use contrastive learning on latent feature representations to enhance the agreements between local and global models.
Very recently, FedDC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> improved the SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> by dynamically updating the objective function of each client, which contains a constraint penalty term and a gradient correction term.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Instead of learning a common global model, another promising direction for tackling non-iid data issue is learning personalized models. Personalized FL targets adapting the common consensus model to fit each client’s individual data distribution. For example, PerFedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> introduces meta-learning in FL to obtain a personalized variant of FedAvg; Ditto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> utilizes regularization terms and multi-task learning objectives to train personalized models; FedBABU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> proposes to share encoders across clients but preserve classifiers locally to perform the personalization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Besides federated training on non-iid data, another important direction is federated generalization, which aims to improve the generalizability of federated models on unseen clients outside the federation. FedDG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> first proposes this setting on medical images, and it presents a method to share client distribution information in a privacy-protecting way. FedADG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> extends federated generalization to natural images and proposes to use federated adversarial learning to measure and align distributions among different clients. Recently, Yuan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> studied the generalization gap by considering two levels, i.e., out-of-sample gap and participation gap, and proposed a semantic synthesis strategy that enables realistic simulation without naturally-partitioned data; Caldarola et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> improve generalization in federated learning by employing sharpness-aware minimization and averaging stochastic weights.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Many efforts have been made to improve the FL on non-iid data, but all these existing works focus on boosting performance for clients either inside or outside the federation.

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Not only in the context of FL, the data heterogeneity issue has also been studied in many scenarios, such as multi-site learning, domain adaptation, and domain generalization. These works further motivate the emergency need for one unified framework to tackle the heterogeneity issue in internal and external data simultaneously.
For example, in multi-site learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> works, experiments show that the model suffers a significant performance drop on external validation data.
In domain adaptation and generalization which focus on improving performance for target (external) domain, a key idea is forcing a model to be domain agnostic. This idea essentially averages the domain conflict, thus the performance drops on each source (internal) domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. Galstyan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> also propose to measure metrics on training data when designing domain generalization algorithms.
These works only focus on internal training or external testing, but all emphasize the importance of designing well-performing algorithms on both internal and external data. Therefore, a unified framework is highly demanded.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Batch Normalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> is an indispensable component in many deep neural networks and has shown its success in neural network training. Relevant literature has uncovered several benefits given by batch normalization. Santurkar et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> show that BN makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother during training process, the smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients. Luo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> decompose BN into population normalization and gamma decay, and consider it an implicit regularizer to improve the robustness of optimization.
Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> provide a characterization of signal propagation and gradient backpropagation in wide BN networks at initialization.
Morcos et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> suggest that BN implicitly discourages single direction
reliance, thus improving the model generalizability. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> take advantage of BN for tackling the domain adaptation problem. However, besides our early work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, very limited study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> considers the effects of BN in FL, and only empirical results are demonstrated. It is unclear what role BN plays in the scope of FL, especially for non-iid data. Comprehensive theoretical and empirical studies still remain unexplored to date.</p>

Since aggregated risk minimization is performed without sharing clients’ local data, the non-iid features issue brings challenges from two aspects. First, the local risk minimization differs due to non-iid features, this diverges the aggregated risk minimization and harms the convergence rate. Second, the global model trained on heterogeneous features via the aggregated risk is not guaranteed to be an accurate estimation for each specific client, causing high generalization errors on testing clients. The error would largely increase when testing on external clients. It is a critical issue, because, in real-world settings, many clients may never participate in training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.</p>

Next, we consider our proposed framework that utilizes the client-specific BN strategy for the unseen client. Intuitively, the proposed client-specific BN performs the normalization using re-estimated mean and variance, making the unseen test data follow the standard distribution. Since the seen clients’ distributions have been normalized to standard distribution, client-specific BN decreases the distance between distributions of seen and unseen clients. Then we formally present the new generalization error of our framework.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human cognitive systems are immune to the distribution change induced by different devices because humans are more sensitive to causal relations than statistical associations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The causal relation can be identified via causal reasoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, which introduces a core concept of intervention to ignore nuisance factors (i.e., not the cause of groundtruth).
Inspired by this, we propose to leverage causality to understand and explain the effects of UniFed.</p>

<div id="S3.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For non-iid features, as the shifts of feature distributions (e.g., noises or different styles) usually make no impact on human decisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, it is reasonable to assume that the feature shifts across clients come from nuisance factors. This is because the changes in task-related factors induce decision changes for both humans and neural networks.
For our proposed client-specific BN, it can be regarded as a specific distribution change resulting from the intervention on client’s original feature distribution, which helps eliminate nuisance factors and preserves task-related causal features.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We validate our framework UniFed for internal federated client training and unseen external client testing on two datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to show that: 1) our method achieves a faster convergence rate than state-of-the-art FL algorithms during training, 2) our method improves the performance on internal clients, 3) our method improves the model generalizability on external clients, 4) how the external client testing results would be affected in real-world with ablation studies on three different key points. All the results are reported by calculating the average of three independent runs. Code will be released.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have investigated many state-of-the-art FL algorithms designed for tackling non-iid data. No matter whether these methods are designed to overcome the non-iid issues from the client-side or server-side, we show that our client-specific BN strategy is compatible with these methods (shown in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 3.5 A Causal View of UniFed with Explainability ‣ 3 Method ‣ UniFed: A Unified Framework for Federated Learning on Non-IID Image Features" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>). This means our client-specific BN can be readily integrated into these methods to make further improvements.
We implement our proposed client-specific BN on current state-of-the-art FL algorithms to show the benefits of faster convergence, higher performance on internal clients, and better generalization performance on external clients.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">All our FL models are trained with cross-entropy loss and SGD optimizer. For data split, when performing experiments for internal federated training, all clients’ data are randomly split into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 0.7, 0.1, and 0.2. As for the unseen external client testing, the data from internal clients are randomly split into 80% for training and 20% for validation for each client. The data from external clients are all held out for testing.
Without particular notice, we report the image classification accuracy results obtained with a batch size of 32 and a momentum value of 0.9. We train the model for 200 communication rounds with a learning rate of 0.001. The local update epoch of each client is set to 1. The model is selected based on the highest validation accuracy.</p>

We plot the loss curves for each client and the average loss. The original algorithm is denoted in a dashed line, and client-specific BN (+Ours) is denoted in a solid line. From the figure can be observed that, our proposed strategy clearly improves the average convergence speed for almost all of the FL algorithms, i.e., achieves the same loss with fewer communication rounds. Besides, client-specific BN achieves lower loss than original methods when the model has converged. This attributes to the non-iid features are normalized into a standard distribution by client-specific BN, alleviating the divergence for the global model during model aggregation. Furthermore, we notice that some methods (e.g., MOON, PerFedAvg) may present the overfitting issue (i.e., the loss curve increases at late training rounds), while our strategy keeps a stable training trend. This observation also demonstrates the benefits of using client-specific BN for federated training.

<br class="ltx_break">We then show the performance improvements for internal clients in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ UniFed: A Unified Framework for Federated Learning on Non-IID Image Features" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. In this table, the first row of each group is the testing performance using original algorithms, and the second row is the performance using our client-specific BN. Some methods show better performance compared the baseline method FedAvg. On top of this, our approach consistently improves by at least 3% on the average test accuracy for almost all methods. Note that PerFedAvg is a personalized method, this approach further updates model by performing extra SGD update steps using several labeled test data. Our client-specific BN consistently improves PerFedAvg on every single client, even though the performance boost is not as large as others. By including eight state-of-the-art FL methods for comparison, the overall efficacy and good compatibility of client-specific BN are well validated.</p>

It is noticed that, our approach achieves a significant increase in unseen client testing accuracy on the challenging CIFAR-10-C dataset, which presents a wide scope of feature shift. On average, for all unseen testing clients, our obtained unseen client generalization results increase at least 7.21% for non-personalized FL methods, and further increase accuracy by 3.9% on the PerFedAvg, which utilizes a small number of labeled test data.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The federated model may suffer different degrees of performance degeneration with the presence of heterogeneity in feature space.
This problem becomes even more severe for external clients with unseen data distribution shift. It is imperative to overcome the heterogeneity to promote federated model quality, especially for critical medical applications with a low error tolerance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite>.
Our proposed unified federated framework can mitigate the heterogeneity in feature space and help improve the training convergence as well as performance on both internal and external clients. Although many efforts have been put into designing FL algorithms for non-iid data, our framework first bridges the gap between internal and external clients with one light-weight and effective strategy. Besides showing effectiveness from empirical results, we also provide theoretical analysis for internal training and external testing stages, and explain the whole framework from a view of causal reasoning.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Compatibility and complexity.</span>
Our framework is designed in a unified shape by one client-specific BN strategy, which can be seen as a lightweight add-on to be readily combined with existing FL methods. This strategy is independent of the optimization, communication, and aggregation designs in FL and only requires the model to contain the BN layer, which is an indispensable component of nearly all neural networks. Our experimental results have demonstrated the good compatibility of client-specific BN on various FL algorithms which have different method designs. The theoretical analysis of such a combination is an interesting direction for future work. We also note that since our framework does not require BN layers to be included in aggregation, this helps reduce the communication burden.</p>

<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Privacy concerns.</span>
Although the FL paradigm reduces the privacy risks by keeping data locally, recent works demonstrated that the sharing of model parameter updates might also make FL vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>, <a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>. However, due to the property of not aggregating BN layers, our framework presents extra merit for reducing the risks of such gradient inversion attacks in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite>. Specifically, since the exposure of statistics in BN layers significantly improves the quality of gradient inversion, our client-specific BN strategy weakens the quality of attacks by not sharing the statistics. And our strategy also does not affect the final model performance.</p>

<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Personalized FL.</span>
Instead of learning a common global model, personalized FL methods have been explored to maximize local performance by training personalized models for each client. Our framework can also be regarded as the personalized FL method by learning personalized BN layers. However, compared with existing personalized FL methods, which typically suffer a negative aspect of the lack of a common global model after training, our method provides a complete solution for testing on either internal or external clients, boosting the applicability.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work proposes a novel and unified federated framework, UniFed, for tackling the non-iid features problem. Our proposed method promotes both federated training and testing with non-iid features via one unified solution, i.e., let each internal/external client use its specific batch normalization layers. We provide theoretical guarantees for a faster convergence speed and lower generalization error bound of client-specific BN compared with aggregated BN. We also perform causal reasoning for UniFed to provide a novel viewpoint to explain the effectiveness of our framework. In experiments, our extensive evaluations have demonstrated that UniFed can significantly improve the convergence behavior, model performance, as well as generalization capability on both natural and medical images with the presence of non-iid features. We also perform comprehensive analytical studies to investigate several key factors which may affect the model prediction for the real-world application.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe that UniFed can improve a wide range of applications in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. A few interesting directions for future work include extending the validation in more scenarios such as autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite> and analyzing what types of differences in local data can benefit from UniFed.
Furthermore, it would be interesting to investigate the importance of position for BN layers in the network to dynamically adapt BN for internal/external clients.</p>
