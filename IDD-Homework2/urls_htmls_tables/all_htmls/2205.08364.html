<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">We study a fully decentralized federated learning algorithm, which is a novel gradient descent algorithm executed on a communication-based network. For convenience, we refer to it as a network gradient descent (NGD) method. In the NGD method, only statistics (e.g., parameter estimates) need to be communicated, minimizing the risk of privacy. Meanwhile, different clients communicate with each other directly according to a carefully designed network structure without a central master. This greatly enhances the reliability of the entire algorithm. Those nice properties inspire us to carefully study the NGD method both theoretically and numerically. Theoretically, we start with a classical linear regression model. We find that both the learning rate and the network structure play significant roles in determining the NGD estimator’s statistical efficiency. The resulting NGD estimator can be statistically as efficient as the global estimator, if the learning rate is sufficiently small and the network structure is well balanced, even if the data are distributed heterogeneously. Those interesting findings are then extended to general models and loss functions. Extensive numerical studies are presented to corroborate our theoretical findings. Classical deep learning models are also presented for illustration purpose.

</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p2.1" class="ltx_p">We study here a gradient descent algorithm for decentralized federated learning. Our methodology has two important elements. The first is gradient descent, which is arguably the most popularly used optimization method for complex statistical learning (e.g. deep learning). The second is federated learning, which is a novel collective learning paradigm. The objective here is to train a global model collectively by a large number of local devices (or clients). Often those devices can be naturally connected with each other through a network (e.g. a wireless communication network). Then, how to conduct a gradient descent algorithm on this network and study the resulting estimator’s statistical properties become problems of great interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p3.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, we consider a standard statistical learning problem with a total of <math id="p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N" display="inline"><semantics id="p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">N</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑁</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="p3.1.m1.1c">N</annotation></semantics></math> observations. For each observation, there is a response of interest and a predictor
with a fixed dimension. There are also parameters of interest, which need to be estimated by minimizing an appropriately defined loss function. Traditionally,
the whole sample is placed on one single computer and then processed conveniently. However, in federated learning, data are often distributed across a large number of clients (e.g. mobile devices). One major concern is the privacy issue. Typically, the data generated from different clients could contain highly sensitive private information. Passing the original data from local clients to a central computer may incur a high risk of privacy disclosure. Nevertheless, to train the global model, we need the information contained in the datasets distributed across different clients. This inspires the novel idea of federated learning to fix the privacy disclosure problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p4.1" class="ltx_p">The original idea of federated learning was first proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Konečnỳ et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. They assumed that there exists a central computer, which can be connected with a large number of clients. To train the global model, the central computer collects the local parameter estimators computed on each local client after local gradient updating iteratively. Then, the aggregating parameter estimators are passed to each local client. Transporting local parameter estimators protects privacy better than directly passing the raw data from local clients to the central computer. This leads to the classical federated learning algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, which has been extended by many researchers. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Smith et al. (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> proposed a novel strategy to handle federated multi-task learning problems.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cheu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> proposed a distributed differentially private algorithm for stricter privacy protection. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hashimoto et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> developed a robust optimization method to handle worst-case risk.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p5.1" class="ltx_p">These federated learning algorithms require a central machine, which is responsible for communicating with every client. Such an type of architecture is easy to implement. However, it suffers from several serious limitations. First, it is not the best choice for privacy protection, because the central machine itself could be vulnerable. In fact, if the central machine is conquered, the attacker is given the chance to communicate with every client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bellet et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Second, this centralized network structure is extremely fragile for stable operation. In other words, the central machine has an overly important role in the network. When the central machine stops working, the entire learning task stops. Third, centralized network structure has a high requirement for network bandwidth. This is because the central machine has to communicate with a huge number of clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p6.1" class="ltx_p">To fix these problems, a number of researchers advocate the idea of fully decentralized federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Colin et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Vanhaesebrouck et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Tang et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. The key feature is that there is no central computer involved for model training and communication. Although one central computer may be needed to set up the entire learning task, it is not responsible for actual computation. Consequently, all the computation-related communications should occur only between individual clients. This leads to a communication-based network structure. Each node represents a client and each edge represents the communication relationship between the clients. Subsequently, local gradient steps are conducted for each client. The corresponding local parameters are updated by aggregating the information from their one-hop neighbours (i.e. directly connected neighbours) in the network. This leads to the Gossip SGD method of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Blot et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> and Decentralized (Stochastic-)GD method of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yuan et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> further proposed new algorithms based on the exchange of both parameters and gradients in each iteration for better convergence speed.
In addition,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lalitha et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> proposed a Bayesian-type approach to estimate the interested parameter for additive models in the aperiodic strongly connected network.

In addition, some literature imposed restrictive assumptions on the data distribution pattern, e.g. homogeneous distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Richards and Rebeschini, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Richards et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.

<p id="p8.1" class="ltx_p">In our work, we develop a novel methodology for decentralized federated learning. The new methodology allows the data distribution pattern across different clients to be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Moreover, the proposed method only requires the network structure to be weakly balanced. This is an assumption weaker than the double stochastic matrix assumption, which has been popularly used in the past literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yuan et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Tang et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Richards and Rebeschini, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Richards et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Meanwhile, both the numerical convergence and statistical efficiency are studied. Specifically, our methodology is based on the classical structure of the decentralized federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yuan et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Blot et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. For convenience, we call the method network gradient descent (NGD) method. First, we assume that different clients are connected with each other by an appropriately defined network. The corresponding network structure can be mathematically described by a network adjacency matrix. Second, we conduct a gradient descent algorithm on each local client. To calculate the local gradients, the target client needs to update the current estimator to be the next one by the method of gradient descent. The gradient is computed based on the current estimator, which is taken as the averaged estimators generated by the network neighbours. This leads to an interesting gradient descent algorithm, which can be executed on a fully connected network.</p>
</div>
<div id="p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p9.1" class="ltx_p">We theoretically prove that the NGD algorithm numerically converges to a limiting estimator under appropriate conditions for the learning rate.
The resulting estimator is referred to as the NGD estimator and its asymptotic properties are investigated. We show theoretically that the statistical efficiency of the NGD estimator is jointly affected by three factors. They are, respectively, the learning rate, the network structure, and the data distribution across different clients. Our theory suggests that a statistically efficient estimator can be obtained even if the data are heterogeneously distributed across different clients, as long as the learning rate is sufficiently small and the network structure is sufficiently balanced. This seems to us a very interesting or even surprising theoretical finding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lian et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. However, if the data distribution across different clients are well homogeneous, the technical requirement for both the learning rate and network structure can be further relaxed.
Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p id="p10.1" class="ltx_p">The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the NGD algorithm and presents its numerical and asymptotic statistical properties. The numerical studies are presented in Section 3, including the simulation experiments and a real data example of image data analysis by deep learning. Finally, Section 4 concludes with a brief discussion. All technical details are relegated to the Appendix.</p>

By equation (<a href="#S2.E2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>), we find that the NGD estimation process can be represented by a linear dynamic system. This representation immediately leads to two interesting questions. First, does a stable solution exist for this linear dynamic system? Second, if there is a stable solution, does the aforementioned NGD algorithm converge to it? These problems are considered in the next subsection.</p>

converge to it. Thus, the NGD estimator does not exist because it cannot be computed. Second, surprisingly, we find that the numerical convergence of the NGD algorithm can be fully assured by the learning rate only. In other words, the network structure is not very important in determining the NGD algorithm’s numerical convergence. However, as we show subsequently, the network structure does play a critical role in determining the NGD estimators’ statistical efficiency. This is demonstrated in the next subsection.</p>

To deal with more general locally convex settings, a novel method has been developed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ho et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ren et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> for studying the estimation error and the computational complexity of algorithm-based estimators. The key idea is to construct an interesting reference estimator sequence for the actual algorithm-based estimator sequence. The reference sequence is constructed based on the population version of the interested algorithm. Next, by studying this population version reference sequence, the optimization error of the interested algorithm can be investigated. Furthermore, by studying the difference between the actual and reference estimator sequences, the stability error of the interested estimator can be controlled. However, how to apply this interesting technique to our NGD algorithm seems not immediately straightforward. It should be an interesting topic for future study.</p>

If this happens, then the numerical convergence of the NGD algorithm can no longer be assured. Thus, the key question here is: how likely this undesirable situation can happen in real practice. To address this interesting question, we study here two important network structures very carefully. They are, respectively, the central-client network and the circle network.</p>

The detailed setting and results are shown in Appendix C.1. From the results, it could be found that

<p id="p54.1" class="ltx_p">We present here a number of numerical studies to demonstrate the finite sample performances of the NGD method based on both simulation studies and a real data example. For simulation studies, several simulation models are used to generate the whole sample data. Once the sample data are generated, they are then distributed to different clients. We consider two different distribution patterns. The first one is  <span id="p54.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">homogeneous</span>. All the observations are distributed to different clients randomly. Thus, the sample distribution across different clients should be homogeneous. The second one is <span id="p54.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">heterogeneous</span>. We sort all the observations according to their response values. Then, we sequentially distribute them to different clients according to their sorted response values. Thus, the observations allocated to the same clients share similar response values, and then, distributions should be heterogeneous across different clients. As a result, the estimators produced by different clients separately can hardly be consistent. Once all the simulated data are generated and distributed across different clients, the clients are then connected with each other by one particular type of network structure, as described in Subsection 2.4.</p>

Unfortunately, this is one of the most popularly used network structures in practice. The fixed-degree network structure performs slightly worse than that of the circle-type network structure. Recall that the in-degree of the fixed-degree network structure is fixed to be 2 in this example. As demonstrated in the next subsection, its performance can be greatly improved by allowing the in-degree to be slightly larger. Second, comparing the upper and bottom panels, we find that little difference is detected.

Furthermore, the network structure plays a significant role in determining the statistical efficiency of the NGD estimators. The circle-type network structure is the best, and the central-client network structure is the worst. In addition, data heterogeneity has little influence on the statistical efficiency of the NGD estimators.</p>

<p id="p68.6" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in Subsection 2.3, the network structure plays an important role in determining the NGD estimators’ statistical efficiency. Among various possible network structures, the fixed-degree type network is easy to implement in practice. Thus, we study its finite sample performance in this subsection. In particular, we focus on the effect of nodal degrees. Accordingly, the simulation example with the fixed-degree network structure in Subsection 2.4 is replicated for both OLS problem and general loss functions but with different nodal degrees. To ensure that the NGD algorithm converges to the global estimator, the learning rate considered for these three models is set to be sufficiently small as <math id="p68.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math"

<p id="p71.2" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we apply the proposed NGD method to more sophisticated deep learning models for large-scale datasets. Specifically, we conduct the following two experiments.

In the contrast, those of both the circle-type and fixed-degree networks are much smaller. By the time of convergence, the prediction errors based on those two network structures could be as small as the optimal one. While the circle-type network slightly outperforms the fixed-degree network. Second, from the right panel, it could be concluded the standard deviation of the Err values (in log-scale) for the central-client network is always the largest, while that of the circle-type network is the smallest.</p>

</div>
<div id="p76" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p76.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we develop a methodology for a fully decentralized federated learning algorithm. Both the theoretical and numerical properties of the algorithm are carefully studied. We find that the numerical convergence properties are mainly determined by the learning rate. However, the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are related to the learning rate, network structure and data distribution pattern. A sufficiently small learning rate and balanced network structure are required for better statistical efficiency, even if data are distributed heterogeneously. Extensive numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the finite sample performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="p77" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p77.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we discuss interesting topics for future study. First, our study analyses a synchronous NGD algorithm, which ignores asynchronous problems, which should be the subject of further study. Second, our theorem suggests that a sufficiently small learning rate should be used for the best statistical efficiency. However, in practice, an unnecessarily small learning rate would lead to painfully slow numerical convergence. Then, an interesting research problem is how to practically schedule the learning rate to balance between statistical efficiency and numerical convergence speed. In addition, our methodology focuses on the situation when the loss function is globally or locally strong convex. How to generalize our theoretical results to more general locally convex settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ho et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Ren et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> remains to be a challenging but also an interesting topic for future study.</p>
