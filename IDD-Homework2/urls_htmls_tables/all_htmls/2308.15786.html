<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that maximizes the potential of data-driven models for edge devices without sharing their raw data.
However, devices often have non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, meaning their local data distributions can vary significantly. The heterogeneity in input data distributions across devices, commonly referred to as the feature shift problem, can adversely impact the training convergence and accuracy of the global model.
To analyze the intrinsic causes of the feature shift problem, we develop a generalization error bound in FL, which motivates us to propose FedCiR, a client-invariant representation learning framework that enables clients to extract informative and client-invariant features.
Specifically, we improve the mutual information term between representations and labels to encourage representations to carry essential classification knowledge, and diminish the mutual information term between the client set and representations conditioned on labels to promote representations of clients to be client-invariant.
We further incorporate two regularizers into the FL framework to bound the mutual information terms with an approximate global representation distribution to compensate for the absence of the ground-truth global representation distribution, thus achieving informative and client-invariant feature extraction.
To achieve global representation distribution approximation, we propose a data-free mechanism performed by the server without compromising privacy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving client-invariant representation learning and solving the data heterogeneity issue.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With
the ever-increasing popularity and deployment of edge devices, there is a tremendous amount of data generated by users on a daily basis.
These data hold valuable insights that can be utilized to enhance various artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services.
However, with the increasing privacy concerns as well as the enormous communication costs, reckless data collection and centralized training are no longer acceptable.
Serving as an efficient and privacy-preserving training paradigm, federated learning (FL) enables distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without revealing their private data.
The classical FL approach, represented by FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, has successfully demonstrated its potential in edge-AI tasks, such as autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, virtual reality (VR) services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and unmanned aerial vehicle control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One major obstacle to efficient FL is the data heterogeneity among devices, i.e., the data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID).
It has been verified that FL algorithms often suffer from degraded accuracy and slow convergence with non-IID data, which are inherently caused by deflected local updates and local optima <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
The non-IID issue in FL can be classified into two categories: label shift and feature shift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Label shift arises when clients have different distributions of class labels, even if the input feature space is the same. Feature shift, on the other hand, occurs when the underlying distributions of input features vary across clients, despite having a common label space.
In this work, we focus on the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">feature shift</em> problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which typically arises in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and wildlife protection applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> because of the device and environmental discrepancy.
For example, in wildlife protection applications where the cameras are placed in different locations to capture images of wildlife, the images from these cameras are different in tonality, rendering them skewed in features.
These discrepancies are primarily caused by distinct environmental conditions like weather and illumination levels.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the feature shift problem in FL, many studies proposed to introduce local constraints with the knowledge of the global model or gradient information for clients, whereby the discrepancy between local updates is mitigated.
These methods, however, focused on the algorithmic aspect and only achieved limited performance gains with heavy data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Meanwhile, another stream of studies endeavored to solve the feature-shift issue through synthetic data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, but sharing extra synthetic data among clients inevitably leads to data privacy leakage.
In addition, explicit feature alignment among clients is another effective technique to solve the feature shift problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
By sharing and aggregating local features as global features, clients can align the local features with the global features, thereby reaching a common feature space for solving the feature shift problem.
Nevertheless, the local features remain susceptible to overfitting with heterogeneous data distributions, resulting in biased global features after aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The feature shift problem has been extensively studied in classical centralized training, particularly in the context of domain adaptation and domain generalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which aim to transfer the knowledge of labeled source domains to a different target domain.
Many studies have established the generalization error bounds of the target domain on the source domains, using the source risk and the discrepancy between source and target domains.
These bounds provide sufficient conditions to reduce the error on the domain dataset and thus address the centralized feature-skewed issue.
Consequently, many works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> have employed domain-invariant representation learning to reduce the generalization bound for better domain adaptation and generalization.
However, the bounds derived in centralized settings are incompatible with FL since the source domains are distributed across clients.
With private distributed data, all the existing domain-invariant representation methods for domain adaptation lose their effectiveness without the access to all the data domains during the training process.
Therefore, it is critical to analyze the intrinsic causes of the feature-skewed issue in FL and propose effective methods to address it accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we first develop a generalization error bound for the global mixture dataset on local datasets in FL, which identifies two key factors for addressing the feature shift issue: the empirical local risks and the <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{H}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ℋ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">ℋ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{H}</annotation></semantics></math>-divergence between global and local datasets.
Motivated by this analysis, we propose a <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated</em> <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">client-invariant</em> <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">representation learning</em> algorithm, called <em id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedCiR</em>, to reduce the generalization error bound by encouraging local models to extract informative and client-invariant features from an information-theoretic perspective.
Specifically, FedCiR introduces two mutual information terms. The first term promotes features to be informative by maximizing the mutual information between representations and labels, which addresses the information-insufficient issue in local models caused by the limited data. The second term diminishes the mutual information between the client set and representations conditioned on labels, which advances representations across clients to be client-invariant. To integrate these mutual information objectives into FL, we develop two regularizers that bound the objectives using an approximate global representation distribution. Such an approximation is needed since the ground truth distribution is unknown in FL. To achieve this approximation without compromising privacy, we propose a novel data-free mechanism using a generator, which is trained to maximize the consensus between local classifiers at the server. The first proposed regularization enhances the global view for local client representations, while the second explicitly aligns global and local distributions, ensuring representations retain just the client-invariant information needed.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FL under data heterogeneity:</span>
FL was originally proposed by McMahan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> as a distributed training paradigm to train a global model without disclosing local private data.
However, the statistical heterogeneity, which adversely affects the convergence and accuracy performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, quickly emerged as a major obstacle in FL.
To address this issue, many works added proximal terms to regularize local objective functions with the global knowledge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
For instance, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> included a regularizer into local training to force the local updates to get close to the global model.
FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed a dynamic regularizer for each client to ensure the consistency between the stationary points of local and global empirical loss.
In addition, MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> utilized contrastive learning to reduce the distance between representations output by the global and local models to correct the local training.
These methods, however, cannot fundamentally eliminate the data heterogeneity and may encounter the performance bottleneck in extreme cases with highly heterogeneous data distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, instead of pushing local parameters to trace the global parameters, some methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> attempted to align the intermediate features between clients through the global prototypes, which are computed by averaging the features for each class locally and aggregating them among clients at the server.
However, the local prototypes suffer from overfitting problems with data heterogeneity, and naively aggregating them leads to imprecise global prototypes.
In contrast, this work aims to align the representation distributions of clients with a global representation distribution, which is approximated by maximizing the consensus among local classifiers due to its absence in FL, thus improving training stability and efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another research line for data heterogeneity relies on data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
Many studies attempted to generate and share synthetic data using a generative model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> or a mixup mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
Nevertheless, recklessly sharing synthetic samples raises extra privacy concerns.
To mitigate potential privacy leakage, recent approaches have developed data-free knowledge distillation mechanisms to generate auxiliary data with a generative model at the server, which can be used for global model calibration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and local model updating <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
These methods, however, required clients to upload the training data distributions to the server to optimize the feature generator, which is excessively vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Different from them, we utilize the ensemble predictions of local classifiers to train the feature generator without extra local information leakage.
More importantly, we further utilize the generator to estimate the global representation distribution for client-invariant representation extraction, which benefits solving the feature shift problem.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Domain-invariant representation learning:</span>

Domain-invariant representation learning has been proven effective for domain adaptation and generalization by reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
Adversarial learning is a widely used mechanism to learn the domain-invariant features by gradually disentangling the irrelevant and domain-specific features via additional discriminators <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
The adversarial networks are able to push representation distributions of different domains to be the same, thereby enabling domain-invariant representation learning.
FedADA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and FedADG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> adopted this technique to effectively solve domain adaptation and domain generalization problems, respectively, in FL.
However, due to the limited domains of data in each device, they demanded to train additional generators to generate the lacking domains of data for adversarial training, which aggravates the computation burden for devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another stream of methods for domain-invariant representation learning is explicit feature distribution alignment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, which can be achieved by minimizing the distance between source and target distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.
However, these methods require the access to all the domains of data during the training process and thus are incompatible with FL.
A recent work FedSR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> used probabilistic networks to approximate feature distributions for clients and aligned them via iterative local updating and global aggregation.
Nevertheless, FedSR is sensitive to the client number and suffers from the local overfitting problem due to the distinct divergence of deterministic networks between clients caused by the non-IID data.
Instead, this work approximates the global representation distribution with the ensemble predictions of local models at the server, thus improving the stability and effectiveness of feature distribution alignment.</p>

Feature-skewed problems often arise in edge AI applications due to the variations in natural conditions and processing methodologies across edge devices.
For example, the images taken by smartphones in a rural area may be different from those taken by smartphones in an urban area.
With the feature distribution shift among clients, traditional FL methods, like FedAvg, attempt to learn all possible feature knowledge, including client-invariant and client-specific knowledge, during local training.
However, the client-specific knowledge causes representation divergence, i.e., <math id="S3.p3.5.m5.7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p(\bm{z}|k,y,\bm{x})\neq p(\bm{z}|k^{\prime},y,\bm{x})" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p3.5.m5.7a"><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.cmml"><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.3.cmml">p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒛</mi><mo fence="false" id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">|</mo><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.2.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.2.2.cmml">y</mi><mo id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.3.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.3.3.cmml">𝒙</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.3.cmml">≠</mo><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.3.cmml">p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.3.cmml">𝒛</mi><mo fence="false" id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.2.cmml">|</mo><mrow id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml"><msup id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">′</mo></msup><mo id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.4.4" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.4.4.cmml">y</mi><mo id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.p3.5.m5.5.5" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.5.5.cmml">𝒙</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.3" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p3.5.m5.7b"><apply id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7"><neq id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.3.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.3"></neq><apply id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1"><times id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.2"></times><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.3">𝑝</ci><apply id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.1">conditional</csymbol><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.2">𝒛</ci><list id="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.6.6.1.1.1.1.3.2"><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.1.1">𝑘</ci><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.2.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.3.3">𝒙</ci></list></apply></apply><apply id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2"><times id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.2"></times><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.3">𝑝</ci><apply id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.2">conditional</csymbol><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.3">𝒛</ci><list id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1"><apply id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑘</ci><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.7.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3">′</ci></apply><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.4.4.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.4.4">𝑦</ci><ci id="S3.p3.5.m5.5.5.cmml" xref="S3.p3.5.m5.5.5">𝒙</ci></list></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p3.5.m5.7c">p(\bm{z}|k,y,\bm{x})\neq p(\bm{z}|k^{\prime},y,\bm{x})</annotation></semantics></math>, leading to an accuracy reduction.
Although many studies have proposed to alleviate the feature shift issue by reducing the divergence of local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, guidelines that can fundamentally solve this problem still remain unclear.</p>

which is able to solve the feature shift problem in centralized training by minimizing the generalization error on the target domain.

In general, for classification tasks in FL, we can adopt the last fully-connected layer followed by a softmax layer as the classifier and the cross-entropy loss as the loss function, which are both convex, such that Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem2" title="Theorem 2. ‣ 4 Generalization Error Bound for Federated Learning ‣ FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> is valid.
Compared with the error bounds in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> that require the impractical joint error of the optimal hypothesis w.r.t. source and target domains, the generalization error bound derived in Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem2" title="Theorem 2. ‣ 4 Generalization Error Bound for Federated Learning ‣ FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> characterizes the sufficient conditions to relieve the feature-skewed issue in FL.

<p id="S4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">According to Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem2" title="Theorem 2. ‣ 4 Generalization Error Bound for Federated Learning ‣ FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we can reduce the risks of the global dataset by minimizing the local source errors and marginal distribution distance between global and local datasets, thereby solving the feature-skewed issue.
To achieve this goal, we propose a novel FL algorithm that learns label-discriminative and client-invariant representations in the next section.
The client-invariant representation learning is effective since it achieves smaller divergence between the global and local datasets in the feature space (the second term in Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem2" title="Theorem 2. ‣ 4 Generalization Error Bound for Federated Learning ‣ FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), which further reduces the discrepancy between global and local models and achieves lower local risks (the first term in Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem2" title="Theorem 2. ‣ 4 Generalization Error Bound for Federated Learning ‣ FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) in local training.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we propose a method called <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedCiR</span> to achieve label-discriminative and client-invariant representation extraction and reduce the generalization error for FL.
Specifically, we propose two mutual information terms to promote the representations to be class-discriminative and client-invariant, respectively.
Moreover, two local regularizers are incorporated into FL to bound these two mutual information terms with an approximate global representation distribution.
To achieve the approximation, we further develop a data-free mechanism by maximizing the consensus of the uploaded classifiers, which protects the privacy as strict as FedAvg.</p>

FedGen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> requires additional training data distribution for representation distribution approximation, which is vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and brings extensive privacy risks.
Instead, our proposed data-free mechanism only leverages the local models to approximate the global representation distribution and does not bring extra privacy exposure.

To encourage the generator to maximize the agreement of all the clients, the server inputs the representations into all the uploaded local classifiers to compute the ensemble predictions.
Then, the generator is optimized by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the ensemble predictions and the corresponding labels.
To relieve the computation burden for clients, the server updates the global representation distribution set <math id="S5.SS4.p5.8.m8.4" class="ltx_Math"

The Camelyon17 dataset is a binary classification task for detecting tumors in varying hospitals and the Iwildcam dataset is a multi-class classification task for wildlife animal images captured by cameras at different locations.
For the Iwildcam dataset, the data among cameras (clients) are both label-skewed and feature-skewed, and most of them are invalid background data and
useless for training.
Therefore, we only use ten classes of samples in ten of the cameras that have the largest data volume.</p>

FedGen employs a data-free knowledge distillation mechanism to regularize the local models, resulting in a better performance compared with FedAvg and FedProx.
FedProc and FedSR rely on the feature alignment to minimize the local model divergence. However, the experiment results reveal that they exhibit instability with different random seeds on some datasets, e.g., DomainNet and PACS.
This is because the average prototypes and representation networks in the server cannot accurately identify the precise features for alignment in the feature space as compared with our proposed data-free mechanism for representation distribution approximation.
In addition, FedCiR is consistently superior to the baselines on the real-world datasets: Camelyon17 and Iwildcam, which demonstrates its effectiveness in practical applications.</p>

FedCiR achieves a significantly faster convergence rate compared with the baselines.
While FedGen may enjoy a higher learning efficiency in some settings by relying on effective proxy data, our proposed approach can explicitly align the representation distributions of all the clients and extract client-invariant representations, thereby achieving the fastest convergence rate.</p>

Notably, the accuracy of FedProc and FedSR is sensitive to the numbers of clients due to the unstable prototypes and representation networks averaged over them.
In contrast, FedCiR maintains stable and competitive performance across all the settings, highlighting the effectiveness and stability of client-invariant representation learning.</p>

Furthermore, FedCiR is robust against all the baselines at different levels of local updating steps, particularly on the PACS dataset.
Notably, when the number of local steps exceeds 100, FedCiR outperforms the second-best baseline by more than 3<math id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math>, indicating its high training reliability and efficiency.</p>

The results show that FedCiR consistently outperforms FedAvg in terms of lower risks in clients.
This is because the client-invariant representations induced by FedCiR reduce the discrepancy among local models.
Consequently, the aggregated global model becomes more generalized for local datasets, resulting in lower local errors.
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 6.3 Sensitivity Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>, the average PAD between global and local datasets is smaller in FedCiR than in FedAvg (i.e., the dot is below the diagonal), which verifies the effectiveness of FedCiR in reducing the <math id="S6.SS4.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{H}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S6.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ℋ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1">ℋ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{H}</annotation></semantics></math>-divergence between global and local datasets.
Moreover, the PAD between any pairs of local datasets is also lower in FedCiR than in FedAvg, explicitly demonstrating that FedCiR can extract more client-invariant representations compared with FedAvg.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel federated representation learning framework, called FedCiR, to solve the feature-skewed issue in FL.
Based on our established generalization error bound for FL, we proposed to extract informative and client-invariant features by utilizing two mutual information terms.
FedCiR incorporated two regularization terms to bound these two mutual information terms with the global representation distribution, which not only improves global knowledge but also facilitates client-invariant representation training.
To mitigate the issue of the absence of global representation distribution in FL, we employed a generator to approximate it through a data-free mechanism.
Experiments verified the effectiveness of FedCiR in client-invariant representation extraction and solving the data heterogeneity issue.
In the future, we will investigate how to utilize pretrained generative models to solve the federated feature shift problem by generating the insufficient domains of data for devices.</p>
