<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning-based Autonomous Driving (AD) models often exhibit poor generalization due to data heterogeneity in an ever domain-shifting environment. While Federated Learning (FL) could improve the generalization of an AD model (known as FedAD system), conventional models often struggle with under-fitting as the amount of accumulated training data progressively increases. To address this issue, instead of conventional small models, employing Large Vision Models (LVMs) in FedAD is a viable option for better learning of representations from a vast volume of data. However, implementing LVMs in FedAD introduces three challenges: <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(I)</span> the extremely high communication overheads associated with transmitting LVMs between participating vehicles and a central server; <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(II)</span> lack of computing resource to deploy LVMs on each vehicle; <span id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(III)</span> the performance drop due to LVM focusing on shared features but overlooking local vehicle characteristics. To overcome these challenges, we propose pFedLVM, a LVM-Driven, Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning framework. In this approach, the LVM is deployed only on central server, which effectively alleviates the computational burden on individual vehicles. Furthermore, the exchange between central server and vehicles are the learned features rather than the LVM parameters, which significantly reduces communication overhead. In addition, we utilize both shared features from all participating vehicles and individual characteristics from each vehicle to establish a personalized learning mechanism. This enables each vehicle’s model to learn features from others while preserving its personalized characteristics, thereby outperforming globally shared models trained in general FL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that pFedLVM outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach by 18.47%, 25.60%, 51.03% and 14.19% in terms of mIoU, mF1, mPrecision and mRecall, respectively.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous Driving (AD) is a highly complex task. One of the major challenges in developing an effective AD system is the poor model generalization due to significant data heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>
, which results from frequent domain shifting. For example, an AD vehicle transitioning into an unfamiliar environment may experience a notable decline in model performance compared to operations in usual and known settings.</p>

This FedAD system is pictorially illustrated in <a href="#S1.F1" title="In I Introduction ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As time progresses, the amount of data incorporated in the FedAD system continually expands, which helps to achieve substantial improvement in AD model generalization compared to deep learning model trained on data from each individual vehicle. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword. In general, the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Bias-Variance Tradeoff</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> in classical regime states that when the volume of data is less than what the model can comfortably accommodate, the model tends to overfit. Conversely, if the data volume exceeds the model’s capacity, the model is susceptible to under-fitting. In the context of the FedAD system, as more and more data is used to train the FL model, the amount of information would eventually exceeds the model capacity, increasing the risk of under-fitting and leading to poor generalization performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle such under-fitting problem, recent research enters the modern regime of <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Large Models (LMs)</span>. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked a significant milestone in the advancement of natural language processing (NLP), exhibiting proficiency across a variety of applications, such as language comprehension and generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, interpretation of user intentions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, solving question answering tasks based on structured data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and complex reasoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Similarly, Large Vision Models (LVMs) demonstrate the capability to interpret visual input and extract comprehensive semantic insights from image data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, deploying LMs within FedAD system presents its own set of challenges. Firstly, due to the extremely large number of parameters in LMs, the communication between vehicles and the central server can lead to unbearable overheads. Secondly, the computing resource at vehicles would not be sufficient to train a large model locally. Thirdly, the inherent focus of LMs on extracting general features often leads to the inadvertent neglect of unique, vehicle-specific local characteristics. This issue primarily stems from the intrinsic weakness of <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">generic overgeneralization</span> in LMs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Such overgeneralization issue arises due to the LMs’ training on widely varying data aimed at capturing universally applicable patterns. Consequently, the nuanced details that are critical for distinguishing specific local attributes may be overlooked.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome these challenges in the context of FedAD system, we propose the <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">pFedLVM</span> framework which involves a two-fold strategy. On the one hand, since a major part of the AD system is vision-based, we propose deploying Large Vision Models (LVMs) on the central server but not at vehicles. To alleviate the computational burden on individual vehicles and communication overhead, each vehicle would train on a small model. Furthermore, the FL exchange between vehicles and the central server would be on features rather than the LVM parameters.
On the other hand, to ensure that each vehicle’s unique characteristics are not neglected, the proposed framework incorporates a feature-based personalized FL (pFL) mechanism. This mechanism leverages both shared features of all involved vehicles and each vehicle’s individual characteristics, allowing for models to be tailored to each vehicle.
Such pFL mechanism is particularly useful in FedAD because vehicles’ behavior or driving pattern varies significantly for different vehicles.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current AD systems are commonly grouped into two categories in various studies: modular-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and learning-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Modular-based methods, although structured, are plagued by error propagation due to potential inaccuracies in both the modeling and problem-solving phases. In contrast, typical learning-based end-to-end approaches offer a promising alternative that mitigates error propagation. These methods directly transform sensory inputs, such as LiDAR point clouds and camera imagery, into vehicular control actions, encompassing throttle, brake, and steering commands. On the other hand, learning-based models can also be used within a modular pipeline, for example, using a learning model for semantic segmentation within the perception module. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for learning-based paradigms lies in their generalization capabilities, often resulting in performance limitations to specific scenarios.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL presents itself as a novel approach aimed at enhancing the generalization ability of learning-based systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. It achieves this through the aggregation of model parameters.Within the realm of AD, FL capitalizes on vehicular networks to combine insights from diverse vehicles operating across varied environments. Consequently, when an AD system encounters a new data sample or edge case, it can disseminate newfound knowledge to the centralized server and subsequently other vehicles, all while safeguarding data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. A notable instance is the cloud federated robotic system proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, which augments the behavior cloning technique to yield precise control commands by leveraging RGB imagery, depth perception, and semantic segmentation.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To surmount the challenge of discrepancies in local data distribution in FL, pFL has been proposed as a solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. This approach customizes the model in each client to account for the unique characteristics of local data. One of the most popular and effective methods for achieving pFL is the architecture-based approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. This method decouples the model’s parameters, allowing only a subset of parameters to be shared and aggregated among clients, while the remaining private parameters are selected based on model architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> or data similarities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> to learn solely on local data. Another option enables each client to fine-tune global model locally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. For example,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> considers the global model as an initial shared model. By performing a few additional training steps locally, all the clients can easily fine-tune the initial shared model. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> implements the above strategy by splitting the backbone into a global model (representation) and a client-specific head and fine-tunes the head locally to achieve personalization. In contrast, unlike the methods mentioned earlier, this paper introduces a novel strategy for pFL that is centered on feature maps, allowing each vehicle to learn concurrently from others while also maintaining its unique characteristics.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, LLMs have achieved great success in the NLP field in various scenarios, such as user intent understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, knowledge utilization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and complex reasoning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> in a zero-shot/few-shot setting. Inspired by the achievements of pre-trained LLMs in NLP field, researchers have turned their attention to exploring pre-trained LVMs. These models, pre-trained on extensive image datasets, hold the ability to decipher image content and distill rich semantic information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. By learning representations and features from a significant volume of data, these models enhance the ability of computers to comprehend and analyze images, facilitating a range of diverse downstream applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.

capabilities of semantic understanding, we propose the use of LVMs to extract and integrate the shared representations and features from all participating vehicles.</p>

In addition, we also design downstream personalized control module to enhance the inference performance. The control module in general consists of two blocks: modular heads (including sequentially connected perception head, planning head and control head) and end-to-end head. Such heads are updated by the loss taking into account these heads’ output and corresponding heads’ ground truth.
By introducing such personalized mechanism, it allows for the models (including feature compressor and various downstream heads) to be customized for each vehicle. This mechanism, with its superior ability to capture unique patterns and preferences, enables each vehicle to perform better than a global model trained through a general FL. This is particularly advantageous in FedAD, where the behavior and patterns among vehicles can vary substantially. The proposed feature-based pFL is illustrated in <a href="#S3.F3" title="In III-C Latent Feature-based Personalized FL (pFL) ‣ III Methodology ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">LVMs tend to perform exceptionally well for a few reasons: <span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">I. Depth and Width:</span> Large models have more layers (depth) and more neurons per layer (width). This allows them to form a hierarchy of features, from simple to complex, and capture more intricate patterns in the data.
<span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">II. Learning Capacity:</span> The large number of parameters in LVMs allows them to effectively capture and model the underlying distribution of the data, especially for complex tasks like autonomous driving. <span id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">III. Attention Mechanisms:</span> LVMs generally incorporate attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on different parts of the input when generating each part of the output. This leads to a more context-aware representation of the data and results in more meaningful feature extraction.</p>

It is proposed to fuse and extract shared features in a zero-shot fashion. These features are high-dimensional vectors that capture the model’s understanding of the image content. They can be used as input for a variety of downstream tasks. Overall, by pretraining on a large-scale image dataset, iGPT learns rich representations of images that can be leveraged for a variety of image-processing tasks.</p>

In general, the heads are commonly divided into two catogrogies: modular heads (including perception head, planning head and control head) and end-to-end head. As all such heads are trained in a similar manner, in this paper, we just focus on the perception head to demonstrate the proposed feature-based personalized FL mechanism. Training of other heads can be easily added as an extension.</p>

Cityscapes dataset, captured across multiple cities, comprises 2,975 training images and 500 validation images. The training dataset features pixel-level labels for 19 classes, such as vehicles, pedestrians, etc. To simulate the practical scenario where different vehicles might have different amount of data, we partition this training dataset randomly for multiple vehicles, and the number of RGB images for each vehicle can be found in <a href="#S5.T2" title="In V-A1 Datasets ‣ V-A Datasets, Metrics and Implementation ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. On the other hand, the CamVid dataset includes a total of 701 samples, each with a pixel-level label for 11 classes.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.7" class="ltx_p">We assess the proposed pFedLVM using four metrics: <span id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.7.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">mIoU</span>: the mean of intersection over union; <span id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.7.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">mPrecision (mPre for short)</span>: the mean ratio of true positive pixels to the total predicted positive pixels; <span id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.7.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">mRecall (mRec for short)</span>: the mean ratio of true positive pixels to the total positive ground truth pixels; <span id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.7.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">mF1</span>: the mean of harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of these two metrics. Such metrics are evaluated across all semantic classes, offering a comprehensive view of pFedLVM’s performance.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The publicly available pre-trained iGPT outputs multiple layers of hidden features. These features are essentially representations of the input data as understood by the model at various levels of abstraction, complexity and capability. In this section, we will present comprehensive experimental results to evaluate the performance of iGPT for the street scene semantic understanding task within the context of AD.
Furthermore, we also conduct additional experiments to evaluate the performance of the LVM+Head framework. Our objective is to benchmark its efficacy against current SOTA models: BiSeNetV2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> and SegNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, with all the metrics mentioned in subsection <a href="#S5.SS1.SSS2" title="V-A2 Evaluation Metrics ‣ V-A Datasets, Metrics and Implementation ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-A</span>2</span></a>.</p>

It is noticed that all four metrics show similar conclusions. In particular, it is evident that multiple layers performs better than single layer. For instance, from <a href="#S5.F6.sf1" title="In Fig. 6 ‣ V-B Evaluation of LVM backbone and Perception Head ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6a</span></a> to <a href="#S5.F6.sf4" title="In Fig. 6 ‣ V-B Evaluation of LVM backbone and Perception Head ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6d</span></a>, iGPT_All and iGPT_Middle_4 exhibit better mIoU values and fluctuate less compared to other options. Furthermore, the averaging of multiple layers, such as iGPT_All_Avg and iGPT_Middle_4_Avg, can outperform single layer but underperform multiple layers, as they smooth out the details of features in different layers. Moreover, a comparison between iGPT_Last and iGPT_Middle_1 reveals a notable distinction: features extracted from the middle layer exhibit better performance over those from the last layer in the context of downstream semantic segmentation tasks. This observation is in line with the results reported by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Notably, the performance disparity between iGPT_Last and the other considered options is markedly more pronounced, underscoring the conclusion that iGPT_Last represents the least favorable option for tasks involving street scene semantic understanding.
Analyzing the evaluation metrics on CamVid dataset in <a href="#S5.F6.sf5" title="In Fig. 6 ‣ V-B Evaluation of LVM backbone and Perception Head ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figs.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6e</span></a>, <a href="#S5.F6.sf6" title="Fig. 6f ‣ Fig. 6 ‣ V-B Evaluation of LVM backbone and Perception Head ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6f</span></a>, <a href="#S5.F6.sf7" title="Fig. 6g ‣ Fig. 6 ‣ V-B Evaluation of LVM backbone and Perception Head ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6g</span></a> and <a href="#S5.F6.sf8" title="Fig. 6h ‣ Fig. 6 ‣ V-B Evaluation of LVM backbone and Perception Head ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6h</span></a>, we observe that they follow similar patterns to that of Cityscapes dataset. It is worth noting that the gap between iGPT_Last and the other options in CamVid is narrower than that of Cityscapes, which is likely due to the smaller data complexity of CamVid than that of Cityscapes dataset.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For gaining insight of the aforementioned observations and analysis, <a href="#S5.T5" title="In V-B Evaluation of LVM backbone and Perception Head ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> provides a more quantitative perspective. Specifically, for both Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, the multiple layers options (termed as iGPT_All and iGPT_Middle_4) achieve the best performance in almost all evaluation metrics. It is noteworthy that iGPT_All and iGPT_Middle_4 exhibit comparably high performance, with only a narrow difference across all evaluation metrics. For instance, for the Cityscapes dataset, iGPT_Middle_4 surpasses iGPT_All with marginal improvements of 1.05 in mIoU, 0.79 in mF1, and 0.9 in mPrecision. However, it falls short by 0.38 in mRecall. In the case of the CamVid dataset, iGPT_Middle_4 again outperforms iGPT_All with increments of 0.31 in mIoU, 1.39 in mF1, and 0.4 in mPrecision, yet it lags by 0.2 in mRecall. Based on these observations, the subsequent experiments adopt iGPT_Middle_4 for further exploration, which strikes a trade-off between predictive performance and computational resources for street scene semantic understanding task within the realm of AD.</p>

There are two obvious observations: I) iGPT combined with perception head outperforms the current leading models BiSeNetV2 and SegNet in almost all metrics. II) iGPT+Head always converge faster than the compared SOTA benchmarks. This is because the pretrained LVM backbone has learned rich representations of various raw natural images.

The table indicates the following clear patterns: I) For classes that contain objects with large sizes, such as Sky, Building, Road, Sidewalk, Tree, and Car, almost all models demonstrate high performance, often exceeding 90% across various metrics. II) The performance drops significantly for classes with narrow objects like Pole and Fence. For example, the models consistently show lower scores, with metrics for the Pole class approaching zero for all models. III) For the classes characterized by a high degree of shape variability, like Bicyclist, iGPT+Head surpasses the performance of BiSeNetV2 and SegNet. This better performance may be due to iGPT’s exposure to a more diverse dataset during training, which likely includes a wide range of Bicyclist gestures, in contrast to the more constrained CamVid dataset used for BiSeNetV2 and SegNet. These findings highlight the importance of the scale and diversity of training data for iGPT, which contribute significantly to its robust generalization capabilities, particularly for complex classes with variable shapes.</p>

Both FedDyn and FedProx include a hyperparameter that requires careful tuning. In addition, the SegNet model has been verified to achieve comparable performance to iGPT+Head on both Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, as detailed in the previous subsection. Therefore, the SegNet model is employed as the underlying architecture for all FL algorithms under consideration in this study.
The hyperparameters for FedDyn and FedProx are set to 0.005 or 0.01.

This variation in performance is attributed to the different sizes of datasets used for each vehicle (shown in <a href="#S5.T2" title="In V-A1 Datasets ‣ V-A Datasets, Metrics and Implementation ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>). This suggests that larger datasets typically provide more comprehensive training, leading to better model performance, whereas smaller datasets may limit a model’s ability to learn and generalize, resulting in a relatively poor performance. IV) The quantitative improvements of the pFL-Vehicle-#3 compared to FedAvg are 10.05%, 11.85%, 10.71% and 9.70% in terms of mIoU, mF1, mPrecision and mRecall, respectively.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To explore how mini-batch size, feature size and LVM size contribute to communication overhead saving achieved by the proposed pFedLVM against the typical FL, Fig. 13 shows the overhead saving versus these parameters. The observations and implications are summarized as follow:
I) <a href="#S5.F13.sf1" title="In Fig. 13 ‣ V-C3 Evaluation of Communication Efficiency of the proposed pFedLVM algorithm ‣ V-C Evaluation of the Proposed LVM-Driven Feature-based pFL (pFedLVM) ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13a</span></a> displays the result of how batch size contributes the communication overhead saving. We can observe that the communication overhead saving fluctuates in a small range as the batch size increases. As mini-batch size has little impact on improving the communication efficiency of pFedLVM, we can adjust it according to the performance need of the personalized models. II) <a href="#S5.F13.sf2" title="In Fig. 13 ‣ V-C3 Evaluation of Communication Efficiency of the proposed pFedLVM algorithm ‣ V-C Evaluation of the Proposed LVM-Driven Feature-based pFL (pFedLVM) ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13b</span></a> tells us that the feature size has an important role in affecting communication overhead saving. For example, for the Cityscapes dataset, the communication reduction drops from approximately 60% to 20% when the feature size increases from 1.0MB to 2.0MB. As shrinking the feature size improves the communication efficiency substantially while it will decrease the personalized models’ performance, we should consider the trade-off carefully. III) LVM size also poses a significant effect on the communication overhead reduction, and this pattern can be viewed in <a href="#S5.F13.sf3" title="In Fig. 13 ‣ V-C3 Evaluation of Communication Efficiency of the proposed pFedLVM algorithm ‣ V-C Evaluation of the Proposed LVM-Driven Feature-based pFL (pFedLVM) ‣ V Experiments ‣ pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Fig.</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13c</span></a>. It is obvious that as the LVM size increases, the communication overhead reduction increases with a large margin as well. This suggests that the proposed framework is well suited for FL integrated with large models.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduced pFedLVM framework, which integrates FL with LVM in autodriving context. The proposed framework deploys LVMs only on a central server to reduce computational burden of vehicles, and exchanges learned features instead of LVMs to reduce communication overheads. In addition, a personalized learning mechanism was incorporated, leading to superior performance than a global model trained using typical FL. The communication efficiency, space and time complexities of the proposed pFedLVM were also analyzed. Experimental results showed that pFedLVM outperforms currently existing SOTA approaches by large margins. Future work could incorporate multi-modal data, such as natural language, into pFedLVM.</p>
