<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">As the application of federated learning becomes increasingly widespread, the issue of imbalanced training data distribution has emerged as a significant challenge. Federated learning utilizes local data stored on different training clients for model training, rather than centralizing data on a server, thereby greatly enhancing the privacy and security of training data. However, the distribution of training data across different clients may be imbalanced, with different categories of data potentially residing on different clients. This presents a challenge to traditional federated learning, which assumes data distribution is independent and identically distributed (IID). This paper proposes a Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model for Non-IID Data (BFLN), which combines federated learning with blockchain technology. By introducing a new aggregation method and incentive algorithm, BFLN enhances the model performance of federated learning on non-IID data. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that, compared to other state-of-the-art models, BFLN improves training accuracy and provides a sustainable incentive mechanism for personalized federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning, introduced by Google in 2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, aims to address the privacy and security concerns associated with traditional machine learning training data. It is now widely applied in fields such as transportation, healthcare, and finance, effectively protecting users’ personal data privacy and security. In federated learning, different training clients typically have differently distributed training data. Traditional federated learning involves training the same model across all clients and using aggregation algorithms to produce a global model, which is updated through multiple rounds of parameter exchanges. This method of aggregating a single global model during training is also known as centralized federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
However, traditional centralized federated learning is a double-edged sword <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. On the positive side, centralized federated learning consolidates all local models. In the initial federated learning aggregation algorithm, FedAvg, the parameters of local models are averaged, yielding good results on independently and identically distributed (IID) data. This aggregation method is relatively simple and achieves effective results. On the negative side, centralized federated learning only aggregates a single global model, which may not perform well on clients with differently distributed training data. Using the same global model for clients with different data distributions can lead to suboptimal performance, as these clients lack a targeted global model. When there are insufficient training samples, clients cannot learn effective data features through the aggregation of the global model, leading to the non-IID problem in federated learning.
For federated learning research, keeping training data local and sharing local model parameters not only protects the privacy and security of local training data but also provides clients with different data distributions a new way to learn more features from other clients’ local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. This is particularly important in cases where sample distribution is imbalanced and individual clients have a small amount of training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) problem in federated learning, a solution known as personalized federated learning has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The non-IID problem refers to the issue where centralized federated learning fails to meet the model training needs of each training client due to inconsistent local training data distributions across different clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. personalized federated learning offers targeted model updates for each training client, allowing them to train models based on their own data characteristics and meet their specific model update requirements.
However, as an emerging technology, personalized federated learning currently lacks effective incentive mechanisms to encourage active participation from training clients in the training process and achieve effective positive updates to the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Without effective incentives, training clients may lack motivation for model training, and the necessary computational and communication resources for training may not be adequately compensated. Consequently, training clients may participate passively or not at all, hindering the continuous development of federated learning.
Compared to centralized federated learning, personalized federated learning does not rely on a single global model, making it challenging to uniformly evaluate the contributions of local training clients to the global model’s training. Therefore, more equitable and scientific incentive mechanisms are needed to promote the sustained development of personalized federated learning.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model for Non-IID Data (BFLN), which consists of two key components: the prototype-based aggregation algorithm (PAA) and the clustering centroids-based consensus algorithm (CCCA).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In PAA, we cluster local models using a prototype-based approach, where models within the same cluster are aggregated to achieve personalized updates. This effectively addresses the non-IID problem in federated learning. In CCCA, we designate the training client closest to the cluster centroid as the representative client for that cluster, which then joins a packing queue and takes turns packaging blocks, ensuring the sustainability of the blockchain packaging process. Additionally, CCCA introduces an incentive mechanism based on the number of cluster members: the more members in a cluster, the greater the rewards for its training clients. This is based on the premise that a larger number of members within a cluster indicates a greater contribution of that cluster’s local models to the training of other local models, and thus, they deserve more rewards.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section provides a comprehensive review of relevant literature. We start by briefly introducing the work on non-iid data distribution in personalized federated learning. Subsequently, we delve into the state-of-the-art approaches in incorporating incentive mechanisms into FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many personalized federated learning (FL) approaches have been proposed to address the non-i.i.d. (non-independent and identically distributed) problem.
Canh T. Dinh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed the personalized FL (pFedMe) algorithm using Moreau envelopes as clients’ regularized loss functions. This algorithm helps decouple the optimization of personalized models from the learning of the global model in personalized FL’s bi-level problem.
Alireza Fallah et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> explored personalized solutions for federated learning to find an initial shared model that users can adapt to their local datasets by performing one or a few gradient descent steps on their local data.
A. Tan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> summarized and analyzed the development of personalized federated learning, examining its motivations, highlighting its ideas, challenges, and opportunities, and offering prospects for its future development.
Liam Collins et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed a new federated learning framework to learn shared data representations across clients and local models for each client. This method demonstrated linear convergence in a linear setting, achieving near-optimal sample complexity and effectively reducing the dimensionality of each client’s problem.
Yuyang Deng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> introduced the adaptive personalized federated learning (APFL) algorithm, where each client trains their local model while contributing to the global model. They also proposed a communication-efficient dual-stage optimization method to reduce the number of communication rounds.
Aviv Shamsian et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a new approach using a hypernetwork to tackle the non-i.i.d. problem by training a central hypernetwork model that generates a set of models, one for each client. This architecture provides effective parameter sharing among clients while maintaining the ability to generate unique and diverse personalized models. Additionally, since hypernetwork parameters are never transmitted, this method decouples communication costs from model size.
Qiong Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a personalized federated learning framework for smart IoT applications in a cloud-edge architecture. To address heterogeneity in IoT environments, this study examined personalized federated learning methods to mitigate the negative impacts of heterogeneity and meet the requirements of rapid processing and low latency in smart IoT applications.
Michael Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> calculated the optimal weighted model combination for each client based on how much a client can benefit from another client’s model.
Xiaokang Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a personalized federated learning framework based on model contrastive learning (PFL-MCL). This framework effectively enhances communication and interaction in the metaverse environment by leveraging large-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-modal metaverse data. Unlike traditional FL architectures, this framework develops a multi-center aggregation structure that learns multiple global models based on dynamically updated local model weight changes, and it constructs a hierarchical neural network structure that includes personalized and federated modules.
Zihan Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> introduced a new PFL algorithm, FedACS, with an attention-based client selection mechanism. FedACS integrates an attention mechanism to enhance collaboration among clients with similar data distributions and alleviate data scarcity issues. It prioritizes and allocates resources based on data similarity.</p>

</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">At the same time, various incentive mechanisms for federated learning have been proposed.
Peng Sun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> introduced a contract-based personalized privacy-preserving incentive mechanism called Pain-FL. This mechanism provides customized payments to employees with different privacy preferences as compensation for privacy leakage costs while ensuring satisfactory convergence performance of the learning model.
Ahmad Faraz Khan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed PI-FL, a one-time personalized solution accompanied by a token-based incentive mechanism to reward personalized training. PI-FL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by generating high-quality personalized models while respecting client privacy.
Mengqian Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> combined game theory with an incentive mechanism and differential privacy (DP) to design an FL scheme (incentive mechanism for FL). They explored three DP variants and conducted convergence analysis on DP-based FL models. Then, using game theory, they analyzed the natural state of servers and clients during the FL process and formulated utility functions for both parties, considering potential attacks.
Jiawen Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> designed a user-centric privacy-preserving framework for decentralized federated learning (FL) in the healthcare metaverse. They used Age of Information (AoI) as an effective data freshness indicator and proposed an AoI-based contract theory model under Prospect Theory (PT) to incentivize data sharing in a user-centric manner.
Shenglv Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposed a learning-based federated meta-learning incentive mechanism to motivate local clients to join data alliances. First, they suggested rewarding clients based on the amount of data they contribute to model training. To analyze the behavior of model owners and local clients, they formulated the incentive training task as a Stackelberg game and designed a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learn the optimal pricing and participation strategies for task publishers and local clients.
Shuyuan Zheng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> addressed both incentive mechanisms and privacy protection with FL-Market. This market incentivizes data owners by providing appropriate payments and privacy protection. FL-Market enables data owners to receive compensation based on their privacy loss.
Yufeng Zhan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> studied incentive mechanisms in federated learning to encourage edge clients to participate in model training. Specifically, they designed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based incentive mechanism to determine the optimal pricing strategy for the parameter server and the optimal training strategy for edge clients.
Jingwen Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a federated learning incentive mechanism based on reputation and reverse auction theory. Participants bid for tasks, with their reputation indirectly reflecting their reliability and data quality. In this federated learning scheme, participants are selected and rewarded by combining their reputation and bids within a limited budget.
Rui Hu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> designed an effective incentive mechanism using game theory to select users most likely to provide reliable data and compensate them for their privacy leakage costs.
Yajing Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed a blockchain-enabled secure and incentive federated learning (BESIFL) paradigm.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When there are significant differences in data distribution among training clients in federated learning, training a single global model to learn the knowledge embedded in all clients’ data is often ineffective. A deep learning model can be divided into two parts: the representation layer and the decision layer. The representation layer, typically comprising the early layers of a deep learning model, learns and expresses the knowledge contained in the training data for use by the decision layer. The decision layer classifies the input data based on the knowledge provided by the representation layer.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For training clients with non-IID data distributions, the representation layer learns different knowledge due to the varied data distributions and quantities of different types of data they possess. In this scenario, aggregating the representation layer parameters from different training clients into a single model, as done in traditional federated learning, fails to accurately fit the data from different clients.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we introduce the proposed BFLN model, which comprises two main components: the prototype-based aggregation algorithm (PAA) and the consensus algorithm based on cluster centroids (CACC). In the PAA, we propose a new federated learning aggregation algorithm specifically designed for non-IID data. In the CACC, we introduce a novel consensus algorithm tailored for federated learning, along with an incentive mechanism for personalized federated learning.</p>

Compared to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, our method inputs the same data into different local models from the aggregation client to obtain prototype vectors.

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In BFLN, we propose a consensus algorithm based on clustering centroids. Leveraging the partition results from spectral clustering in PAA, we select local training clients closest to the centroids of each cluster and add them to the packing queue. Inspired by the DPoS consensus algorithm, where cluster centroids are added to the packing queue as block producers who take turns to pack blocks, in each round, these packing clients also serve as aggregation clients by inputting local data into different local models to obtain prototype vectors. This queuing mechanism ensures block packing efficiency, reducing computational waste compared to the widely used PoW consensus algorithm. Given their randomness and representative nature of cluster clients, centroids are selected from each cluster to join the packing queue.
After performing spectral clustering on local models in PAA, we compute the centroids of each cluster. We calculate the average Pearson correlation coefficient within each cluster to determine the centroids.

Upon receiving local models, during block packaging, the aggregation client includes transactions in the block that contain hash values of all aggregated local models. The consensus algorithm verifies whether the hash values of local models included in the transactions initiated by the aggregation client match those submitted by the local training clients. Only if the aggregation client’s transactions include the hash values of local models can the local training clients receive rewards distributed by the blockchain network.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this chapter, we tested the model performance on three datasets under three different levels of data label bias distribution.

In the CIFAR10 dataset, when the training data bias is 0.1, BFLN achieves the best performance with 5 clusters, reaching an accuracy of 0.8769, which is a 1.02% improvement over the best-performing baseline, FedProto. When the data bias is 0.3, BFLN performs best with 7 clusters, achieving an accuracy of 0.7806, surpassing other baseline algorithms. At a bias level of 0.5, BFLN again achieves the best results with 7 clusters.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the CIFAR100 dataset, when the training data bias is 0.1, BFLN with 7 clusters improves by 1.92% over the best-performing baseline, FedProx, achieving the highest model accuracy. With a bias of 0.3, BFLN reaches an accuracy of 0.3973 with 7 clusters, higher than any other baseline algorithms. When the bias is 0.5, BFLN achieves an accuracy of 0.3589 with 7 clusters, surpassing the best-performing baseline, FedProx, by 1.24%. In the CIFAR100 dataset, the best performance is consistently achieved with 7 clusters, which is the largest number of clusters we tested.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the SVHN dataset, with a training data bias of 0.1, BFLN achieves the best results with 7 clusters. At a bias level of 0.3, the highest accuracy is achieved with 6 clusters. When the bias is 0.5, BFLN with 7 clusters outperforms all baseline models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, the accuracy improvement of the BFLN model on the SVHN dataset is less pronounced. This might be because the SVHN dataset is relatively simpler than CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and the models already achieve relatively high accuracy under different bias levels. In CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, when the data bias is lower, the improvement of our proposed BFLN model over baseline models might be more significant. This could be because BFLN clusters the prototype vectors and aggregates local model parameters, resulting in better clustering of training clients with similar data when the data bias is higher.</p>

This is because, with fewer clusters, the similarity requirement for prototype vectors during clustering is lower, making it easier for local training clients to be grouped into the same cluster. With more clusters, the similarity requirement for prototype vectors is higher, and only clients with highly similar prototype vectors are grouped into the same cluster, leading to greater differences in rewards among different training clients.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model for Non-IID Data. Our goal is to address the non-IID problem and develop an incentive mechanism for personalized federated learning. To achieve this, we introduce two main components: the prototype-based aggregation algorithm and the consensus algorithm based on cluster centroids. These components cluster local models by comparing prototype vectors obtained from different local models with the same input data, thereby achieving personalized federated learning. Additionally, we propose an incentive mechanism tailored to the characteristics of BFLN, ensuring the enthusiasm of clients participating in federated learning training. Compared to existing personalized federated learning methods, our proposed BFLN demonstrates better performance in scenarios with non-IID local data distributions. Experimental results show that our incentive mechanism is effective and aggregation algorithm has better performance than baseline algorithms.</p>
