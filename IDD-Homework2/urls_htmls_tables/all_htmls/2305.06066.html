<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) based magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction can facilitate learning valuable priors from multi-site institutions without violating patient’s privacy for accelerating MR imaging. However, existing methods rely on fully sampled data for collaborative training of the model. The client that only possesses undersampled data can neither participate in FL nor benefit from other clients. Furthermore, heterogeneous data distributions hinder FL from training an effective deep learning reconstruction model and thus cause performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose a Self-Supervised Federated Learning method (SSFedMRI). SSFedMRI explores the physics-based contrastive reconstruction networks in each client to realize cross-site collaborative training in the absence of fully sampled data. Furthermore, a personalized soft update scheme is designed to simultaneously capture the global shared representations among different centers and maintain the specific data distribution of each client. The proposed method is evaluated on four datasets and compared to the latest state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that SSFedMRI possesses strong capability in reconstructing accurate MR images both visually and quantitatively on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an effective tool in the clinic for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis evaluation. However, since the MRI data acquisition process needs to traverse a sequence of paths in k-space, the imaging speed is slow, which has been a bottleneck limiting factor for the wide adoption of MRI in routine clinical practice. Undersampled data acquisition is an effective technique to accelerate MR imaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To reconstruct high-quality MR images from undersampled k-space data, deep learning methods have been widely used <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The performance of deep learning models depends heavily on the dataset utilized. Large quantities of heterogeneous paired undersampled and fully sampled data are required to properly train a deep learning model, whereas collecting these data at a single institution is challenging. Multi-institutional collaboration is necessary in this case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One method to utilize multi-institutional data is gathering the data together and training a centralized model on this large dataset. Although the method is straightforward and effective, it involves a data privacy issue. Federated learning (FL) methods are proposed to specifically address this issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Unlike centralized training, FL methods utilize decentralized data in multiple institutions to collaboratively learn a global model without sharing any local raw data. One classic FL method, FedAvg, obtains the weights of the global model by averaging the weights of local models during each communication round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Although this type of FL can exploit multi-institutional data while protecting data privacy, they suffer from a notable data heterogeneity issue. The multi-institutional data are probably acquired with different imaging protocols. Large discrepancies may exist between the data distributions, which can hinder the learning of an effective global model and in turn, lead to inferior performance for each client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, several methods have been proposed to address the issue of data heterogeneity in FL for accelerating MR imaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, adversarial alignment between source and target sites was proposed to improve the similarity of latent-space representations in reconstruction models. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the reconstruction models (unconditional GAN and U-Net) were divided into an aggregated part and an unaggregated part to learn the generalized and client-specific representations. These methods have achieved better reconstruction performances than traditional federated learning methods. However, all these methods adopted the fully-supervised training approach, and they assumed that enough fully sampled data exist in each institution. In real situations, according to the setting of normal scanning protocols, the acquisition of fully sample data in hospitals is rare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Therefore, developing FL methods that only utilize undersampled data is desired for real clinical applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a self-supervised federated learning method for accelerating MR imaging (SSFedMRI). SSFedMRI can solve the issues of fully sampled data deficiency on each client, achieving cross-site collaborative training with only undersampled data. Specifically, we re-undersample the acquired undersampled k-space data on each client, set them to physics-based contrastive reconstruction networks, and perform local training with designed self-supervised loss. Then, the updated local model will be aggregated into a global model in each communication round. Because the employed physics-based reconstruction networks have fewer parameters than existing FL-based methods, which apply data-based reconstruction network as base framework in clients, reduced communication costs are expected. Heterogeneous data distribution usually causes performance degradation in FL. To address this issue, we propose a personalized soft update scheme. Specifically, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Self-supervised federated learning methods learn representative information from cross-site unlabeled data with different training schemes. Among them, federated contrastive learning (FCL) is a popular direction, which combines contrastive learning with FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.

However, the above workflow of FL for MRI reconstruction has two issues: 1) Whether the client without fully sampled data can participate in FL and benefit from distributed datasets of other clients? 2) For each client, whether it is the best to apply the global model to overwrite entire parameters of local model in each communication round? Our self-supervised FL method for MRI reconstruction in this work is proposed to specifically address these concerns.</p>

SSFedMRI is constructed to tackle the issue of fully sampled data deficiency in FL for MRI reconstruction. To mitigate performance degradation due to data heterogeneity, we design a soft update in SSFedMRI to get the personalized model. SSFedMRI trains a global model with undersampled data supervision and personalized local models via soft update. The pipeline in each communication round of SSFedMRI consists of five steps: (1) local training – On each local client, physics-based contrastive reconstruction networks are constructed for MRI reconstruction. The acquired raw k-space data are re-undersampled into two subsets, which are treated as the inputs of the physics-based contrastive networks. The physics-based contrastive reconstruction networks are trained for <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="L" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">L</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐿</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">L</annotation></semantics></math> epochs with an undersampled consistency loss, a contrastive consistency loss, and a regulation term (Eq. 6 and Eq. 7).

(5) Local model update (soft update) – In each communication round, the local models are softly updated by adding corresponding update items, which are determined by the discrepancies between the global model and the local models.

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Previous FL methods for MRI reconstruction performed supervised learning in the local training step, requiring fully sampled reference data on each client. Here, in SSFedMRI, we perform self-supervised learning with physics-based contrastive reconstruction networks instead. Two different sets of re-undersampled data are extracted from the raw undersampled k-space data, which are treated as the inputs to the contrastive networks. The physics-based contrastive reconstruction networks consist of two same models, which have the same network architecture but with different parameters.</p>

Specifically, we introduce an update item <math id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\left(\Theta_{g}^{r}-\Theta_{k}^{r}\right)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.cmml"><msubsup id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">Θ</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.3.cmml">g</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.3.cmml">r</mi></msubsup><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><msubsup id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.cmml">Θ</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.3.cmml">k</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml">r</mi></msubsup></mrow><mo id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1"><minus id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.1"></minus><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.2">Θ</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.2.3">𝑔</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.2.3">𝑟</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.2">Θ</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.2.3">𝑘</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1.1.1.1.3.3">𝑟</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p1.7.m7.1c">\left(\Theta_{g}^{r}-\Theta_{k}^{r}\right)</annotation></semantics></math> to measure the discrepancy between the global mode and each local model.

To comprehensively compare reconstruction accuracy of these methods with different amounts of training data, we perform experiments under two scenarios. In scenario 5, the reconstruction models are trained with the number of local training dataset described in section IV (4128 slices, 2750 slices, 360 slices, and 2634 slices for training, respectively). In scenario 6, the local training datasets are further reduced to 400 slices, 220 slices, 360 slices and 450 slices, respectively.
The first sub-table of Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.2.1 Reconstruction accuracy ‣ 5.2 Comparison with supervised FL methods ‣ 5 Results ‣ Self-Supervised Federated Learning for Fast MR Imaging" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> lists the quantitative results (PSNR and SSIM) of different approaches under scenario 5. Similarly, the average values of PSNR and SSIM achieved by our proposed SSFedMRI are comparable with or slightly higher than the two existing supervised FL-based methods for MRI reconstruction (FL-MRCM and FedMRI). Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.2.1 Reconstruction accuracy ‣ 5.2 Comparison with supervised FL methods ‣ 5 Results ‣ Self-Supervised Federated Learning for Fast MR Imaging" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> plots the visual reconstruction results and the corresponding error maps (with a display range of [0, 0.7]) of above methods under scenario 5. From the qualitative results, we can observe that our proposed SSFedMRI, which trains in a self-supervised manner, can achieve comparable reconstruction performance when compared to the two supervised federated learning methods. The error maps also reveal that SSFedMRI achieves competitive reconstruction results, especially on the edge of the brain image, the edge reconstructed using SSFedMRI are clearer than that of the others.</p>

Under this more challenging experimental setting, our SSFedMRI performs the best when compared to FL-MRCM and FedMRI. In addition, the performance enhancement brought by SSFedMRI is larger than the setting under scenario 5. Specifically, in scenario 5, the average value of PSNR achieved by SSFedMRI is 9.92<math id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> higher than that of FL-MRCM.

Therefore, we conclude that SSFedMRI is more effective when limited local training data are provided. The reason for above results is that the FL-MRCM and FedMRI employs U-Net as base network, their reconstruction performances rely on sufficient local training data. But in SSFedMRI, MoDL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is employed as base network, which exhibits more superiority when the training data is reduced due to the application of MRI’s physics properties.</p>

Then, we remove the personalized soft update operation (FedProx SS) from SSFedMRI. Here, the global model is applied to overwrite the local models before local training in each communication round. Finally, we remove both the personalized soft update operation and the regularization item in Eq.

Furthermore, we observe that the performances of Fedprox SS are worse than that of FedAvg SS, which may be affected by imbalance data quality and different capabilities of local models by self-supervised learning.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we aim to solve the issue of fully sampled data deficiency in FL for MRI reconstruction. We propose a self-supervised federated learning method, SSFedMRI. Physics-based contrastive reconstruction networks are built on each client to achieve cross-site collaborative training in the absence of fully sampled reference data without sharing data. Compared with existing FL-based methods, reduced communication cost in FL is achieved due to the decreased number of network parameters. To further mitigate performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity in FL, a personalized soft update operation is proposed to softly update local models. Particularly, in each communication round, instead of utilizing the global model to overwrite the local models, SSFedMRI enforces local models to consider the discrepancies between the local models and the global model, forcing local models to learn cross-site prior information from participating clients while still holding optimization towards the local data distributions. Extensive experiments on multi-site complex-valued MRI datasets acquired with different imaging protocols have been performed. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our SSFedMRI can achieve better performances.</p>
