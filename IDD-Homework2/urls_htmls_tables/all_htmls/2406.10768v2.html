We now present our findings to understand the varied needs of rideshare drivers broadly situated under the umbrella of the need for transparency. While the need for transparency surfaced as the primary design theme, representing over 42% <math alttext="(24721/58728)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="p1.1.m1.1"><semantics id="p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2" stretchy="false" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">24721</mn><mo id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mn id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">58728</mn></mrow><mo id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3" stretchy="false" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1"><divide id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1"></divide><cn id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" type="integer" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">24721</cn><cn id="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" type="integer" xref="p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">58728</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="p1.1.m1.1c">(24721/58728)</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="p1.1.m1.1d">( 24721 / 58728 )</annotation></semantics></math> of the concerns generated from Reddit, and forming the bulk of our qualitative data, it’s important to recognize that this theme is not standalone. Drivers identified other needs which are directly derived from and are a consequence of non-transparent practices. Specifically, the absence of transparent practices frequently results in unpredictable work schedules and earnings, jeopardizes driver safety due to a lack of comprehensive ride information, and triggers fairness issues regarding algorithmic decisions and driver treatment.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="p2.1">As a result, we divide our findings into four themes identified from both the driver interviews and Reddit data: enhancing transparency, increasing predictability and agency, improving safety, and ensuring fairness. We present an overview of the findings in Figure <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="p2.1.1">\ref</span>fig:findings-interview-overview. For each theme, we discuss the specific harms, workers’ mitigation strategies, and the design features they suggest for platforms to implement. We complement our rich qualitative interview data concerning RQ1 with quantitative insights from over 400,000 <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="p2.1.2">\texttt</span>r/uberdrivers and <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="p2.1.3">\texttt</span>r/lyftdrivers Reddit community members, across more than 1 million submissions and comments, highlighting the widespread nature of these harms. Specifically, we include a table that presents the most representative harms (ranked according to the frequency of occurrence in the data) identified on Reddit, along with relevant quotes, for each of the themes, compare and interpret that along with the qualitative interview themes.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="id2.1.4.1.1">\thesubsubsection</span> </span>Harm: Lack of desired information for doing work</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="id2.1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id2.1.p1.1">Drivers work under opaque conditions that make it difficult for them to assess the set of opportunities available to them, which hinders their ability to make informed work decisions. Drivers were primarily frustrated with the lack of transparency in geographic information relevant to trips, information regarding surges and bonuses, and how individual ratings and decisions affected their metrics and, thus, their status within the platform. P2 explained their frustration about the lack of transparency with trip destinations, saying: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id2.1.p1.1.1">“If you’re not a high enough tier, you get less information [about the trip]. So you don’t even know exactly like, where the trip is going.” P2</span>. Making <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id2.1.p1.1.2">access to precise geographical features of a trip contingent on a driver’s tier status</span>, exacerbates issues of transparency because a driver’s access to information is contingent on a convoluted algorithmic process that determines their tier status.
Drivers also describe frustrations with the clarity of information they are given about surges and bonuses. Drivers describe the way that bonuses and surges are shown to them as confusing at best and misleading at worst. For example, when navigating the surge heatmap (see Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_ref_self"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\thefigure</span></span></span> for example), <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id2.1.p1.1.3">drivers have a difficult time discerning the exact boundaries of the surge region</span>. P9 told us that: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id2.1.p1.1.4">“I don’t know exactly the boundaries like the limits. When one starts and when one and the other one, you know ends but or starts”P9</span>. Lack of clarity on boundaries in the surge map reduces the utility of the surge map interface as P8 points out: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id2.1.p1.1.5">“So the whole surge map is just terrible because you don’t know where you need to be on the map to actually get the money.” P8</span>. Uncertainty about information presented on the surge pricing map makes it difficult for drivers to form efficient work strategies and impacts their earnings.
Drivers also claimed that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id2.1.p1.1.6">the way information about bonuses is presented in the app is misleading because it fails to clearly explain how much additional money drivers can earn by completing the bonus</span>. P3 says:</p>
<blockquote class="ltx_quote" id="id2.1.p1.2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id2.1.p1.2.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id2.1.p1.2.1.1">”So [Uber] can make that more transparent and stop being deceptive…Because [Uber will] tell you ’We’ll give you a bonus if you do 40 rides like for $200.00.’ But if you already made your $200.00 in your 40 rides, you don’t get anything.” P3</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id2.1.p1.3">Drivers complain that the way bonuses are currently presented is misleading because drivers do not get the bonus amount <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id2.1.p1.3.1">on top</span> of their earnings, but rather the bonus is used to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id2.1.p1.3.2">top off</span> drivers’ earnings if they earn less than that amount for the required amount of rides. However, drivers say that this caveat is not made clear on the bonus offerings page.
Finally, drivers were <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id2.1.p1.3.3">frustrated by the lack of explanation about how individual ratings and decisions impacted their overall in-app metrics</span>. Drivers described feelings of frustration with the lack of explanation about how individual rider ratings and decisions about whether to accept or cancel a trip impacted their overall scores. The lack of information about how their overall metrics were calculated impacted drivers’ behaviors leading some to make decisions that could impact their safety (e.g., not cancelling a trip when the passenger exhibited threatening behavior).
Drivers experience issues with accessing transparent and explainable information that is needed to inform their work strategies. They lack access to precise information about geographical features of trips, clarity on how bonuses and surges function, and explanations regarding how overall driver metrics are calculated. However, all the drivers we spoke with developed strategies for dealing with these informational shortcomings.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id2.1.p1.3.4">Comparison with Reddit Findings:</span>
The transparency and explainability concerns surfaced on Reddit in Table <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:tab:reddit-transparency</span> not only broaden but also reinforce the findings from our interviews, emphasizing the shared notion that rideshare workers lack the necessary information to effectively perform their jobs. Nearly 50% of the transparency concerns related to opaque fares and understanding promotions.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="id3.2.4.1.1">\thesubsubsection</span> </span>Current Mitigations: Reliance on lived experience and social infrastructures</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="id3.2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id3.2.p1.1">Drivers relied on their own lived experiences and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id3.2.p1.1.1">social interactions with other drivers to mitigate lack of transparency and explainability</span> within the rideshare platform. P2 recounted how they learned not to accept rides with destinations in New York because as a driver registered in New Jersey they were not allowed to accept rides in New York without a TLC license:</p>
<blockquote class="ltx_quote" id="id3.2.p1.2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id3.2.p1.2.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id3.2.p1.2.1.1">”I’ve noticed that most of [the rides] take me into New York. So it’s not worth it because I have to come back because I can’t drive in New York. I don’t know if you know that like drivers get a specific area [where they can work], so I could drop off passengers in New York, but I can’t find the ride to go back, so it’s not worth it, because now who’s paying that toll to go that way and not all the mileage and stuff to go back? It’s not something I do anymore because it’s costing me money.” P2</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id3.2.p1.3">Because Uber does not tell drivers on the ride offer screen that they may not be eligible to start new trips from the end destination of the current trip, drivers like P2 have to learn through experience where they should work. Drivers also learned to rely on humans over the algorithm when it came to routing instructions: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id3.2.p1.3.1">“[I] care more about following the passengers direction if they know any particular route” P9</span>. P9 illustrates a shared belief amongst drivers that localized human knowledge is more useful than what the algorithm provides. Drivers rely on online forums such as r/uberdrivers, a popular subreddit, or information from other drivers whom they know to get clarification on how bonuses and quests work. P3 points to the importance of asking more experienced drivers for help on understanding bonus offers saying: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id3.2.p1.3.2">” you have to ask somebody that’s another driver, especially somebody that drives all over, they know. You know, they’ll help you with it.” P3</span>. Drivers are driven off the platform to find supplemental information that enables them to navigate their work on the platform. They draw upon social infrastructures, both in-person and online communities, as well as their own lived experiences to mitigate issues with transparency and explainability.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="id4.3.4.1.1">\thesubsubsection</span> </span>Design Feature 1: Improve ride pickup/dropoff location, fare, and duration information</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="id4.3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id4.3.p1.1">Drivers suggested several design interventions to increase transparency about basic features of a trip offer including ride pickup/dropoff location, anticipated fare, and duration. Drivers called for design interventions that clearly <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id4.3.p1.1.1">display the relevant geographic features of a trip including contextual information</span> that would make it easier for the driver to quickly understand where they are going: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id4.3.p1.1.2">“But what I try to do is I ask the customer, I said, which school are you going to or, you know which town, you know, do, you know, give me, like, an idea.” P3</span>. Including contextual geographic like the name of the town or landmarks in the proximity of the dropoff location helps the driver better understand where they’re going.
Drivers suggested the platform could show standardized <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id4.3.p1.1.3">information about fare breakdowns</span> that make it easier for them to understand how much they will earn from a trip. P4 suggested a model like the one taxi cab companies use where: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id4.3.p1.1.4">“they started off with the base pay. And then there was a there was a certain per mile you went, and then there was also a charge for per minute that you were inside that vehicle.” P4</span>. These fare breakdowns would make it easier for drivers to forecast their earnings and understand how fares were being calculated.
Finally, drivers asked that information about the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id4.3.p1.1.5">duration of a trip be accurate and included alongside the pickup/dropoff location and fare breakdown</span>: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id4.3.p1.1.6">“And if it’s showing the rate, I think it should also show what the duration of the trip is going to be and how far it is” P5</span>. Duration estimates should also incorporate local traffic conditions as many drivers pointed out that duration estimates could be unrealistic.
Drivers pointed out that the amount and quality of information they received for a trip offer was contingent on their tier status. This selective access to information based on a black-boxed determination of driver tier status compounds transparency issues. To overcome transparency issues drivers suggest design interventions that show contextualized geographic information, understandable fare breakdowns, and accurate trip duration estimates.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id5.4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id5.4.p1.1">Aside from design interventions that aid drivers in the immediate moment of getting a ride offer, drivers also want <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id5.4.p1.1.1">post-hoc explanations of how algorithmic decisions about fare breakdowns, overall driver metrics, and promotions are made</span>.
Drivers feel that these explanations would help them make strategic decisions about how to navigate their work. P6 illustrates the importance of knowing how fares are calculated when communicating with passengers:</p>
<blockquote class="ltx_quote" id="id5.4.p1.2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id5.4.p1.2.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id5.4.p1.2.1.1">“I do because sometimes the passengers complain, they get in and say my ride costs X amount of dollars. Why? Why does it cost so much now? And I try not to…get into it. But it’s good to know. So sometimes the passenger comes, gets in the car. And say, well I spent $50.00 for a ride. And I say, well, I only got $18.00 to you know, to myself.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id5.4.p1.3">Knowing how fare breakdowns are calculated could help drivers navigate situations such as the one P6 found themselves in.
Other drivers asked for <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id5.4.p1.3.1">clear explanations of how acceptance and cancellation rates were calculated</span> because they felt compelled to complete rides that they perceived to be unsafe as they were worried about affecting these metrics. Drivers also asked for explanations about how the acceptance and cancellation rates impacted the trips they were offered as they felt that having lower rates would lead to less desirable trip offers but they struggled to gather empirical evidence that would disprove this hypothesis: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id5.4.p1.3.2">“like what [is Uber] basing that off of? I feel like since I started driving a little bit more full time I haven’t gotten [a quest bonus] in quite some time.” P4</span>. P4 illustrates the uncertainty they faced when trying to understand what led to bonus offers. P2 also told us that they wanted explanations about how reward amounts for bonuses are calculated so they could make decisions about how often they needed to drive: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id5.4.p1.3.3">“I mean how the rewards are being calculated? But these numbers change a lot, so I have no idea how these rewards are calculated.” P2</span>.
In summary, drivers want explanations of how algorithmic decisions are made so they can make informed decisions about their work strategies. They want explanations to be provided post-hoc to enable adequate time for reflection.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id6.1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id6.1.p1.1">Drivers face <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id6.1.p1.1.1">challenges with the app’s non-transparent misleading design and confusing interface</span>, impacting their work decisions. For instance, in a trip offer screen (see Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_ref_self"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\thefigure</span></span></span> for example), $24.99 is shown in large font with $2.00 surge in smaller font underneath, leading to mixed interpretations. P3 views this as deceptive, thinking the real rate is $22.99, while others expect it to be nearly $27. This ambiguity complicates quick decision-making. Moreover, drivers P4, P5, and P6 criticize the malfunctioning destination filter, as P6 states: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id6.1.p1.1.2">“Every time I use it, it sends me away from my house. I live close to Philadelphia, it may try to send me to New York.”</span>
Drivers believe that the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id6.1.p1.1.3">platform intentionally matches them with impossible promotions</span>, during hours when they don’t want to work. This belief is not unfounded, given how rideshare platforms rely heavily on algorithmic mechanism design to nudge drivers to go online to increase supply <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">viljoenDesignChoicesMechanism2021</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">rosenblat2016algorithmic</span>]</cite>. P3 described their frustration with this nudging:</p>
<blockquote class="ltx_quote" id="id6.1.p1.2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id6.1.p1.2.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id6.1.p1.2.1.1">“[Uber] offers you the times for the boost that they know that you’re not driving…And I’m like, why are they offering it? It could be something at 11:00 at night…I’m not driving for that. So why are you sending it to me?” P3</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id6.1.p1.3">P3, like many of the drivers we spoke with, has set hours when they want to work but they felt like Uber intentionally only offered them attractive quests outside of their desired work hours. P1 believes this type of nudging is intentional and served to:<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id6.1.p1.3.1">“keep drivers online and that’s how [Uber] makes the most money. When you’re going, you don’t stop…but if you also go offline they punish you. So it’s the same thing. You gotta keep going.” P1</span>. Drivers felt like they had to stay online to get good ride offers and that the algorithm would punish them for logging off by not offering them attractive trips during their online time.
When drivers participate in promotions, they say that the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id6.1.p1.3.2">platform intentionally tries to prevent them from receiving the full promotion amount</span>. P3 describes how the surge incentive disappears when they arrive in the surging area indicated on their map: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id6.1.p1.3.3">“what [Uber is] doing is they’re actually trying to get you to these areas and then the bonus disappears and it’s happening so much lately.” P3</span>. P1 describes Uber offering them non-lucrative and infeasible rides when they near the end of their quest to derail them from completing the required tasks to earn the promotion: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id6.1.p1.3.4">“So they like bait you with ’Oh, you hit this one [ride].’ But you’ll run out of time…or you’ll end up in the middle of Westchester at 4:00 in the morning.” P1</span>. Moreover, several drivers were disappointed that quest terms vary among drivers. The misleading design of surges and quests, that bait drivers to log on or work in certain areas without a guarantee of increased earnings makes it difficult for drivers to achieve predictability and establish a routine with their work strategies.
In summary, drivers describe how Uber’s dark patterns and gamified promotions makes it difficult for them to predict their earnings which keeps them online for longer hours and impedes their ability to develop a stable work routine.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id6.1.p1.3.5">Comparison with Reddit Findings:</span>
The concerns regarding predictability and agency, as detailed in Table <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:tab:reddit-predictability</span> surfaced from Reddit, generally align with and expand upon our interview findings. Similar to interviews, they highlight that drivers frequently encounter unpredictability due to the gamification of earnings, coupled with a limited ability to influence these gamified earnings. Drivers on Reddit also highlight other unpredictability issues, for example, in availability of rides and ride assignments.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id7.2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id7.2.p1.1">To cope with unpredictable earnings as a result of opaque and non-transparent algorithmic features, drivers initially experimented with different strategies to identify profitable trip offers. Experienced drivers, like P9, learned to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id7.2.p1.1.1">avoid chasing surges due to its unpredictability and prefer to accept surges that align with their routine</span>, explaining, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id7.2.p1.1.2">“[I] absolutely [do] not [chase the surge]…because I know it changes with supply and demand.”</span> Similarly, drivers like P5 initially tried to maximize earnings by strategically entering surge areas, saying, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id7.2.p1.1.3">“I may go offline and try to get to the $19 area.”</span> However, they soon realized the inefficiency of this approach, with P5 noting the frustration of surges diminishing upon arrival: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id7.2.p1.1.4">“I expect that by the time I get there [$19 surge] will probably be $8 and then you know you have wasted time.”</span> This experience led drivers to focus on promotions that fit their existing work patterns, as P2 shares, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id7.2.p1.1.5">“I don’t even try to shoot for any higher [value] quest…I just pick the lowest one.”</span>
Drivers also have <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id7.2.p1.1.6">strategies to navigate the app’s algorithm for more predictable rides</span>. P5, for example, focuses on reserved airport trips, explaining, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id7.2.p1.1.7">“once I’ve got a rebound trip from the airport, I turn on my destination filter from there, and work back towards the airport. And because the airport is a popular destination, it usually works.”</span> This preference for airport rides stems from their reliability, as P4 notes, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id7.2.p1.1.8">“I would obviously always get another airport ride to go pick somebody up.”</span> This approach helps drivers secure consistent fares.
Ultimately, about half of our drivers (P1, P2, P3, P8) reported that algorithmic nudges like surges, boosts, quests, and rewards no longer impact their driving decisions because these nudges are too unreliable in terms of earnings. Instead, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id7.2.p1.1.9">drivers rely on more stable metrics like the estimated distance, time, and pickup/dropoff location for a trip</span> to guide their work strategy. Through trial and error, drivers learn about the algorithm’s behavior and tend to avoid unpredictable bonus offers.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id8.3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id8.3.p1.1">Drivers want consistency in the information that they are shown so that they can achieve a baseline level of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id8.3.p1.1.1">predictability that allows them to develop reliable work strategies</span>. For example, if an area is shown as surging on the surge map, drivers expect that the surge still be ongoing when they arrive to do a trip in the surge area. Drivers suggest that the platform could tell them how much they can make from a surge via SMS to help drivers get a better picture of their potential earnings: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id8.3.p1.1.2">“Before the surge they can send SMS to drivers [saying] ’This is what potentially you can make.’ I think that…will motivate a lot of drivers as well. Because people always want to gain information, they can make extra money.” P7</span>. Drivers say surges could be more consistent by extending the time period for which they last: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id8.3.p1.1.3">“Make it should be a whole, say 2 hours bonus time.” P6</span>. To address the fact that surge maps often have confusing and unclear boundaries, some drivers suggest surges could be designed so that: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id8.3.p1.1.4">“if you pick a passenger up right outside the zone. And you’re driving through the zone…you still should be able to get some part of the surge” P6</span>.
Drivers want more <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id8.3.p1.1.5">certainty about potential earnings from surge pricing rides ahead of time</span>, with some pointing to the quests as a good example of how Uber could achieve this. With quests, drivers know how much additional money they can expect to make whereas with the surge there is no guarantee of additional money because the surge areas tend to disappear. However, drivers point to issues with misleading information about quests that could be improved through more easily accessible explanations of the feature.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id9.4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id9.4.p1.1">Drivers want to be able to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id9.4.p1.1.1">easily access explanations for how algorithmic features of the platform work</span>. P3 illustrates this through their experience with the quest feature: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id9.4.p1.1.2">“So they can make [the bonus amount] more transparent and stop being deceptive because the older drivers know that’s not how it used to be, yeah. I mean, they do tell you on the second page that but that’s not right though.” P3</span>. Here P3 calls out how information on how much drivers can expect to earn from a bonus is hidden from drivers when it should be caveated upfront that the bonus amount is supplemental not additional to driver earnings from completed tasks. P6 similarly calls for information about <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id9.4.p1.1.3">“how many rides make up a boost?” P6</span> so drivers better understand how they can increase their earnings through participating in these incentive offers.
Drivers believe access to information about expected earnings is essential in increasing predictability in their work. P5 points out that Uber already can show the information they want saying: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id9.4.p1.1.4">“Why can’t you have the best of both worlds? I think you can have upfront pricing and have a mileage rate at the same time. I mean, they kind of already do it with the reservations.” P5</span>. Here P5 demonstrates how having both rate per mile and rate per minute would help them explain and predict their earnings from a trip offer. Moreover, they claim that with reserved trips, they can already see this information upfront implying that the platform can offer these breakdowns for other trips as well.
In summary, drivers want the explainability of algorithmic features within the Uber platform to increase the predictability of their earnings. For the most part, drivers suggest design solutions that are antithetical to the gamification that Uber relies on to control their marketplace. Drivers see this gamification as the primary driver of unpredictability and suggest interventions that reduce the amount of gamification involved in task allocation.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id10.1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id10.1.p1.1">The lack of transparency in the algorithmic design of rideshare platforms leads to insufficient information for drivers, resulting in unsafe driving conditions. P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, and P9 emphasize the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id10.1.p1.1.1">difficulty in making quick, informed offer decisions during rides, which compromises safety</span>. P1 explains the challenge of determining safe routes under time pressure: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id10.1.p1.1.2">“I got to think about the safest route to get there. It kind of just throws safety out the window because I’m busy reading this.”</span>
P2 adds to this highlighting an experience where he was receiving ride offers while driving on the freeway: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id10.1.p1.1.3">“I’m literally on the bridge, like going 60 or whatever, because of the speed limit, and they literally send me a request, like what do I do?”</span>. P7 highlights the distraction caused by continuous notifications.
Safety concerns are not limited to the road; <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id10.1.p1.1.4">neighborhood safety is also a pressing issue for drivers</span>, especially since drivers can’t see the dropoff location before passenger pickup and are under pressure to accept pickup requests from unsafe neighborhoods. P1 shares a disturbing experience in Philadelphia involving a passenger with a handgun, highlighting the inability to avoid unsafe neighborhoods if one wants to earn a living: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id10.1.p1.1.5">“If you want to stay out of a bad neighborhood…you will never make any money doing this job.”</span> Although drivers care deeply about the safety of all people in their vehicle, as P4: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id10.1.p1.1.6">“my main focus is the safety of not only myself, but also my passenger”</span>, they emphasize that the platform prioritizes profits over people. As P3 laments, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id10.1.p1.1.7">“[Uber] doesn’t think about your safety…they just think about the money. Like how much money can they make? I want safety first, but they don’t think about that.”</span>, thus preventing drivers from prioritizing safety.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id10.1.p1.1.8">Comparison with Reddit Findings:</span>
The Reddit findings presented in Table <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:tab:reddit-safety</span> corroborate and expand upon the interview insights regarding safety. They agree with the need for better decision-making tools for drivers when considering rides and navigating to potentially unsafe neighborhoods. Additionally, these findings broaden the discussion by spotlighting other safety concerns, such as the challenges in reaching support services and contesting false complaints, which are often initially vetted by an algorithm before any human intervention.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="id11.2.p1.1">Drivers face a complex decision-making process prioritizing their safety and earnings. P5 and P6 <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id11.2.p1.1.1">consider passenger ratings and pickup areas as crucial factors for safety</span>. P5 states, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id11.2.p1.1.2">“I’m not going to cancel the trip for the sake of not trying to damage my rating. And especially if it’s like a 4.6 in a not so good area, you know, I’m just not going to take it.”</span> She also emphasizes the importance of safety at night, especially for female drivers: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id11.2.p1.1.3">“What their rating? Is especially like as the woman I drive at night. You know, safety is, my main concern.”</span>
In contrast, some <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id11.2.p1.1.4">drivers prioritize their performance metrics over neighborhood safety and passenger ratings</span>. P9 explains their approach to maintaining a good acceptance rate: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id11.2.p1.1.5">“What happens if you lose a request? Your acceptance rate gets hit. Because of that I set up the app for automatically accepting the ride.”</span> P5 emphasizes reducing phone usage in the presence of passengers to prevent alarming them and avoiding potential complaints: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id11.2.p1.1.6">“I try to touch my phone as little as possible, especially in front of a passenger, because I think it freaks them out too.”</span>
Ultimately, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id11.2.p1.1.7">drivers navigate a precarious balance between ensuring their safety and optimizing for earnings</span>. Some, like P6, will <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id11.2.p1.1.8">not wait long in unsafe neighborhoods</span>: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id11.2.p1.1.9">“If I go to a bad neighborhood. You know, I don’t get a response, you know, within a couple minutes, then I’m definitely trying to pull off.”</span> And P7 discusses the importance of understanding passenger psychology for self-protection. Yet, drivers like P1 often feel <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id11.2.p1.1.10">compelled to accept rides in risky areas</span>, as declining can affect their earnings and the algorithm may offer the same ride again: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id11.2.p1.1.11">“I usually roll the dice and take the person…like 3:00am in the morning at the bottom, which is in West Philly, which is like a really bad neighborhood, you gotta decide if it’s worth it because you’re gambling … that person might try to rob you.”</span> However, he is quick to add that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id11.2.p1.1.12">“You don’t have a choice, otherwise you will make no money.

<div class="ltx_para" id="id12.3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id12.3.p1.1">Drivers assert that actions taken during a ride, such as accepting or canceling offers, should not adversely affect their performance metrics, with a strong focus on ensuring safety while driving. P7 clearly articulates this need, emphasizing that the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id12.3.p1.1.1">algorithm should not penalize drivers for decisions made while driving</span>: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id12.3.p1.1.2">“I think the algorithm is not supposed to punish drivers when they’re driving.”</span> ” This sentiment is echoed by P5, who argues against penalties for not using the phone during a ride as it interferes with navigation: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id12.3.p1.1.3">“I don’t think we should be penalized for, not handling our phone while we’re driving. If the request comes in … it obstructs the navigation we’re using.”</span>
Additionally, drivers emphasize that their <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id12.3.p1.1.4">cancellation rate should not be impacted by cancellations made for safety reasons during a ride</span>. P7 insists that such cancellations, made while driving, should not affect their cancellation metrics: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id12.3.p1.1.5">“Once you’re driving already, if you make cancellations, it should not affect your cancellation.”</span> P5 extends this argument to cancellations due to low passenger ratings, advocating that safety considerations should override concerns about metrics: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id12.3.p1.1.6">“I don’t think we should be docked or penalized or should go towards our cancellation rate for cancellations due to passengers that have low ratings and cancellations that we do while we’re driving.”</span> These statements highlight the drivers’ unanimous call for a system that prioritizes their safety over algorithmic decisions.

<div class="ltx_para" id="id13.1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id13.1.p1.1">Drivers face financial uncertainty due to the lack of transparency in earnings and promotions on rideshare platforms. This financial instability faced by drivers is intensified by the lack of employment protections, leading to issues like algorithmic wage discrimination and insufficient earnings, exacerbated by the lack of minimum wage laws.
Participants highlight issues of algorithmic wage description within the rideshare ecosystem where drivers, despite performing similar work, experienced unequal pay. P2 noted <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id13.1.p1.1.1">significant pay differences for similar work</span>, particularly for airport runs, where she compared her wages with that earned by other drivers. She lamented <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id13.1.p1.1.2">“if you had two different phones and you got two different drivers, one person was getting one thing and somebody else was getting another … and I was like, that can’t be right …it was the same distance, just different people … why is one person offered a higher rate and why is another person offered a lower rate?”</span>. This confusion led P2 to initially, incorrectly assume a technical error of the rideshare platform and explain to a fellow driver at the airport <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id13.1.p1.1.3">“It’s something wrong with your phone. Let’s restart these babies.”</span> This underscores the fact that drivers are often left to question their own devices rather than recognizing systemic flaws in the algorithmic design.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id15.3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id15.3.p2.1">P8 shared screenshots demonstrating evidence of algorithmic wage discrimination with the interviewers. Figure <span class="ltx_ref ltx_ref_self"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\thefigure</span></span></span> shows different rate cards for similar rides across the Garden State Parkway in NJ. The rate card showed $1.23/mile and $0.21/minute for pickups from the east, but only $0.70/mile and $0.18/minute from the west, even though the pickup spots may be less than a mile apart. P8 noted, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id15.3.p2.1.1">“From Lakewood MVC West of the Parkway to Costco [on the] East, Uber charges $9.92 one way, and $11.94 the other.”</span> This evidence aligns with other drivers’ experiences and also highlights the algorithm’s role in wage (and price) discrimination.
Drivers also described experiences highlighting the algorithm’s limitations in considering real-world variables such as traffic and local laws, which lead to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id15.3.p2.1.2">earnings below the state minimum wage</span>. P5 recounted an instance of being stuck in traffic for an hour, only to receive a payment that fell below the NJ minimum wage of $14.13 in 2023, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id15.3.p2.1.3">”I only got paid like $13, but I spent a whole hour in traffic.”</span> Similarly, P9 described a financially unrewarding trip from Garfield, NJ to JFK Airport, where the algorithm did not adequately compensate for time, tolls, and traffic, exacerbated by regional regulations <span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote" id="footnote1"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>NJ drivers cannot pickup riders in NY without additional TLC certifications, see <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="footnote1.1">\url</span>https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/new-york/get-a-license/tlc-application/</span></span></span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id15.3.p2.1.4">”I ended up driving like 4 and 1/2 hours. And Uber paid me like $70.00 or $75.00, but that was with tolls included… So I ended up having like probably $50 or even probably a little less”</span>. Participants highlighted the challenge in holding platforms accountable for below-minimum-wage rides, citing the lack of transparency as platforms do not publicly disclose ride statistics.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id15.3.p2.1.5">Wage and price discrimination, potentially influenced by the demographic traits</span> of drivers and riders, remains opaque with non-transparent platform policies. P4 and P7, both Black men, highlight how drivers’ ratings and earnings are impacted by passengers’ behaviors linked to their race. P4 noted <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id15.3.p2.1.6">“what might be offensive to one person might not be offensive to another. You know, America is a huge melting pot.”</span>. P7 echoed this sentiment, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id15.3.p2.1.7">”Some people…they act certain kind of way based on their race, based on their background, based on where they live…some drivers get a lot of bad ratings.”</span>. He further mused about whether these ratings and reviews may indirectly influence the algorithm’s matching and compensation outcomes.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id15.3.p2.1.8">Comparison with Reddit Findings:</span>
The findings from Reddit, as shown in Table <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:tab:reddit-fairness</span>, not only reinforce the insights from our interviews but also extend the discussion on fairness. Reddit drivers, echoing interview participants, express apprehensions regarding algorithmic biases favoring specific driver attributes, notably demographics. In contrast to interviews, Reddit drivers predominantly emphasize concerns related to elevated service fees (24%) and algorithm-driven driver deactivations (20%), further emphasizing the complexities surrounding fairness in the rideshare ecosystem.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id16.4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id16.4.p1.1">Drivers confront and try to mitigate the effects of financial precarity with a few strategies that, while resourceful, remain significantly limited without substantive platform-led changes.
Full-time drivers, are forced to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id16.4.p1.1.1">work extended hours</span>, as P4 says <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id16.4.p1.1.2">“But you know what…you gotta force yourself to go and do”</span>, to offset pay disparities. P9 echoes this sentiment by stating that, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id16.4.p1.1.3">“the algorithm is kind of like in your nose and it keeps track of how much money you’re making. At the end of the day you notice that I’m not making more than 20 bucks an hour…as a full time driver, you better put in those hours, a lot of hours. So the flexibility right, that is gone.”</span>.
Drivers employ strategies such as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id16.4.p1.1.4">switching apps or relocating</span> to find better fares. P9 describes using both Uber and Lyft: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id16.4.p1.1.5">“I have my other app Lyft you know. I turn [it] on and let it give me a ride. You turn off Uber.”</span> P4 mentions moving to a different area for better offers: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id16.4.p1.1.6">“OK, let me drive, like, 10 miles away from there and then turn back on the app.”</span>
These strategies, while showcasing drivers’ adaptability, underscore the need for platform-level reforms to genuinely address financial precarity.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="id17.5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="id17.5.p1.1">In addressing the issue of fair compensation, drivers emphasize that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="id17.5.p1.1.1">fair pay would eliminate the need for complex algorithmic incentives</span> like surge pricing, different rate cards, and quests. P7 succinctly states, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id17.5.p1.1.2">“I think it’s pretty much just money, yeah.”</span> Similarly, P5 suggests, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id17.5.p1.1.3">“If it can go back to the original rates [before/during Covid-19] that Uber drivers were getting paid, there wouldn’t be a need for all of this.”</span> Echoing this sentiment, P4 adds, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id17.5.p1.1.4">“If it was fair pay, honestly, then, a lot of these issues wouldn’t be a thing. You know, if the mileage and the time equated to the pay that you deserve without any additional bumps or anything like that, then I don’t think there will really be much of an issue.”</span> These statements underline a shared desire for a straightforward, and fair pay structure.
In elaborating on what would be a fair compensation, after accounting for tolls, traffic, return trips, wear and tear of the vehicle, among other factors, P4 offered a practical suggestion, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id17.5.p1.1.5">“if you made at least a dollar per mile used, I think that would be fair enough.”</span>.
