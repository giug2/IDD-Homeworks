<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm that trains machine learning (ML) models on clients’ devices in a distributed manner without the need of transmitting clients’ data to the FL server. In many applications of ML (e.g., image classification), the labels of training data need to be generated manually by human agents (e.g., recognizing and annotating objects in an image), which are usually costly and error-prone. In this paper, we study FL with crowdsourced data labeling where the local data of each participating client of FL are labeled manually by the client. We consider the strategic behavior of clients who may not make desired effort in their local data labeling and local model computation (quantified by the mini-batch size used in the stochastic gradient computation), and may misreport their local models to the FL server. We first characterize the performance bounds on the training loss as a function of clients’ data labeling effort, local computation effort, and reported local models, which reveal the impacts of these factors on the training loss. With these insights, we devise Labeling and Computation Effort and local Model Elicitation (LCEME) mechanisms which incentivize strategic clients to make truthful efforts as desired by the server in local data labeling and local model computation, and also report true local models to the server. The truthful design of the LCEME mechanism exploits the non-trivial dependence of the training loss on clients’ hidden efforts and private local models, and overcomes the intricate coupling in the joint elicitation of clients’ efforts and local models. Under the LCEME mechanism, we characterize the server’s optimal local computation effort assignments and analyze their performance. We evaluate the proposed FL algorithms with crowdsourced data labeling and the LCEME mechanism for the MNIST-based hand-written digit classification. The results corroborate the improved learning accuracy and cost-effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is an emerging and promising ML paradigm, which performs the training of ML models in a distributed manner. Instead of transmitting data from a potentially large number of devices to a central server in the edge or cloud for training, FL allows the data to remain at devices (such as smartphone), and trains a global ML model on the server by collecting and aggregating model updates locally computed on each device based on her local data. One significant advantage of using FL is to preserve the privacy of individual device’s data. Moreover, since only local ML model updates, instead of local data, are sent to the server, the communication costs can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, FL can exploit the substantial computation capabilities of ubiquitous smart devices, which are often under-utilized. As a result, FL can achieve collaborative intelligence, which can enable many AI applications based on networked systems, such as connected and autonomous vehicles, collaborative robots, multi-user virtual/mixed reality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent studies on FL typically focus on supervised learning, which requires a large amount of training data with data labels in the learning process. In many applications of ML, data labels have to be generated manually by human users. For example, for image classification, the object in an image should be recognized and annotated by a human user as the label of the image data. Therefore, as FL does not allow a client to share her local data with the server or other clients, to participate in FL, a client needs to manually label her local data (e.g., images), before she can compute local model updates from her locally labeled data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, data labels generated by human clients of FL are subject to errors. For example, a client may misclassify a dog as a cat. As a result, this incorrect data label will lead to error in the local model, and thus error in the global model obtained by the FL server. Moreover, the labeling error rate of a client generally varies for different clients, depending on the client’s knowledge level of the labeling task. For example, a client who is familiar with dogs will have a lower labeling error rate than another client who is not. Furthermore, the accuracy of data labels is also affected by a client’s effort made in the data labeling task. The data label error rate will be low when the client makes much effort in labeling the data, and otherwise is high when the client makes little or no effort. For example, a client may make no effort in image classification by randomly guessing the object in an image without actually recognizing it.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While a client’s effort impacts the accuracy of her data labels, the effort can be her hidden action that is only known by the client herself and cannot be observed by the FL server. Due to the inaccurate nature of data labels, a strategic client may label her local data arbitrarily without making effort in data labeling, while the server will not be able to verify whether effort is actually made or not. Moreover, the effort made by a client in computing her local model update, which can be quantified by the mini-batch size used by the client in stochastic gradient descent, can also be the client’s hidden action that cannot be verified by the server. As a result, a client may have incentive to compute her local update with a small mini-batch size so as to reduce her resources used in local computation. Furthermore, the local model computed by a client from her local data can also be her private information that she can manipulate in favor of herself, e.g., a client may increase or decrease her true local model and report it to the server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the presence of such strategic clients with hidden data labeling and local computation efforts and private local models, our goal is to incentivize the clients to make truthful efforts as desired by the FL server and reveal their true local models. Such a truthful incentive mechanism is desirable as it eliminates the possibility of manipulation, which would encourage clients to participate in FL. More importantly, the truthful elicitation of clients’ efforts and local models ensures that the FL server can obtain a global model with high and guaranteed accuracy from the learning process, which is a key performance metric of FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The joint elicitation of data labeling effort, local computation effort, and local models for FL calls for a new design that is very different from existing truthful mechanisms. First, the training loss of the global model obtained from FL has a non-trivial dependence on clients’ exerted efforts and reported models. As a result, existing incentive mechanisms for effort and data elicitation do not work for the problem here. Second, due to the complex relationship between the impacts of labeling effort, computation effort, and local models on the training loss, the joint elicitation of effort and models needs to overcome the coupling therein. Third, given the truthful incentive mechanism for effort and model elicitation, the FL server needs to determine how much effort should be made by each client, in order to maximize the server’s payoff.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning.</span> FL has emerged as a disruptive computing paradigm for ML by democratizing the learning process to potentially many individual devices. Most existing studies on FL have focused on algorithm design for FL, such as for reducing the local model drifts across non-IID clients and participating clients selection. Meanwhile, there have been several recent works on computation and communication resource allocation for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, a few recent works studied incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> for FL that take into account participating clients’ strategic behavior. In particular, most of these works considered compensating clients’ communication and computation costs with an economic approach, such as Stackelberg game <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, auction theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, cooperative game <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and contract theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. However, all these prior works have focused on either incentivizing clients’ participation via cost compensation, or truthfully eliciting clients’ participation costs. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed VCG-based mechanisms that incentivize clients to truthfully report their local models. In contrast, this paper studies incentive mechanisms for truthful elicitation of clients’ local models as well as their efforts in data labeling and local computation.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Truthful Incentive Mechanism for Effort and Data Elicitation.</span> There have been lots of research on incentive mechanisms for various applications of data collection and processing, particularly for data crowdsourcing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Many incentive mechanisms incentivize agents to truthfully reveal their participating cost, where the cost is considered to be private for an agent that may not be revealed truthfully without appropriate incentive. There have been studies on truthful mechanism design for hidden efforts in economics literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which is concerned with strategic agents that can make hidden efforts not desired by a principal who recruits the agents to work on a task. A few recent works have studied this problem in the context of crowdsourcing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Mechanism design for truthful elicitation of strategic agents’ data (e.g., opinions) has been extensively studied in various applications (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>), more recently for crowdsourcing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. The data of an agent can be private information that the agent can manipulate in favor of her benefit. Different from existing works, in this paper, we focus on FL and aim to design truthful mechanisms that jointly elicit clients’ hidden efforts in data labeling and local computation and private local models. The truthful mechanism design is non-trivially different from existing works, due to 1) complex dependence of the training loss on clients’ data labeling and local computation efforts and local models; 2) intricate coupling in joint elicitation of the clients’ efforts and models.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From the above problem formulation, we observe that there exists a tradeoff between the FL training loss and the server’s payment to clients. We know that the training loss reduces when clients use larger mini-batch sizes to compute their local updates from Theorem <a href="#Thmthm1" title="Theorem 1 ‣ IV Training Loss Analysis ‣ Truthful Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning with Crowdsourced Data Labeling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. However, using larger mini-batch sizes increases the server’s payment. Therefore, we aim to find the optimal computation effort (in the form of mini-batch size) assignment for each client to maximize the server’s payoff.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We compare the server’s payoff while clients make different computation efforts. From Fig. <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI Simulation Results ‣ Truthful Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning with Crowdsourced Data Labeling" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, we can see that the server’s payoff is maximized when clients make the server’s optimal computation effort. When clients do not make the optimal computation effort, the server’s payoff is lower even if the total computation effort of clients is the same as the optimal computation effort allocation. This is because, in the former case, the computation effort allocation does not care about clients’ heterogeneous computation cost and thus causes higher computation costs.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied FL with crowdsourced data labels, where the local data of each participating client are labeled manually by the client. We characterized the performance bounds on the training loss as a function of clients’ data labeling effort, local computation effort, and reported local models. We then devised truthful incentive mechanisms which motivate strategic clients to make truthful efforts as desired by the server in data labeling and local model computation, and also report true local models to the server based on the derived performance bound. Simulations based on real data demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For future work, we will extend our study to more general settings. In this paper, we studied truthful mechanism design under the assumption that clients’ costs are known to the server. The mechanism design problem where clients’ costs are also private is more practical but challenging. Another direction is to consider partial participation of clients. In this case, the truthful mechanism design and the optimal labeling effort assignment will be different.</p>
