<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning framework that enables collaborative model training while respecting data privacy. In various applications, non-uniform availability or participation of users is unavoidable due to an adverse or stochastic environment, the latter often being uncontrollable during learning. Here, we posit a generic user selection mechanism implementing a possibly randomized, stationary selection policy, suggestively termed as a Random Access Model (RAM). We propose a new formulation of the FL problem which effectively captures and mitigates limited participation of data originating from infrequent, or restricted users, at the presence of a RAM. By employing the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) over the (unknown) RAM distribution, we extend the expected loss FL objective to a risk-aware objective, enabling the design of an efficient training algorithm that is completely oblivious to the RAM, and with essentially identical complexity as FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves significantly improved performance as compared with standard FL, under a variety of setups.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework allowing multiple users to train a global model collaboratively without sharing their local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In recent years, the classical Federated Averaging approach (FedAvg) has developed into an essential learning paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, following a certain basic workflow where each user locally updates its own model parameters and then periodically sends its updated parameters to a central server. The server then appropriately aggregates the received updates of the users and broadcasts to them the new global model parameters. This scheme is repeated until the global model converges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Vanilla FedAvg faces the problem of instability, caused either due to non- indepedent and identically distributed (non-iid) data among users (known as ”client-drift”) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, or due to non-uniform user availability, which happens as a result of several factors, such as network outages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, battery drain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, or user inactivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For instance, when a user device is unavailable, it cannot communicate with the server for a certain time interval. This leads to incomplete global model convergence, to a possible bias of the global model towards the data from the most available users, and less accurate performance of the global model to the data that the less available user have, especially in a strongly heterogeneous regime.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In prior works, several methods address the challenge of non-uniform client availability in FL. For the (server) aggregation step, a set of techniques focuses on re-weighting the model parameters of the users by adapting their weights dynamically. In particular, some works focus on the adaptation of the aggregation coefficients based on several criteria, such as completion of the local steps the users have done <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, or the temporal correlation and their low availability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, or their conformity level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, or their performance on previous steps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, the non-uniform availability of users could be treated by dividing users into blocks based on their relative frequency, and applying a pluralistic aggregation step at each block has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Lastly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> suggests a different FL system that adopts a multiple-channel approach, following specifically the ALOHA protocol and adapting the access probability of users based on their local updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A second group of techniques explores optimal user sampling strategies. Selection of users based on local characteristics, such as their local performance, level of importance, or irrelevance, is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, respectively.
Optimal user selection has also been explored by minimizing the variance of the numbers of times the server samples a client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, or by learning a selection strategy for clients with intermittent availability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Further, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> uses stratified user sampling based on their data statistics to address system-induced bias under time-varying client availability. Lastly, a well-defined communication protocol where the server periodically selects user devices that meet appropriate criteria, is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">In this work</span>, we deal with two key limitations, critical in practical scenarios. First, we consider a stochastic environment allowing only one (for simplicity) user to transmit data each time, with different and possibly highly biased selection probabilities (weights) for each user (restricted random user selection). Secondly, the server is completely agnostic to user selection probabilities, and cannot direct user participation. Under these conditions, the server communicates with the users through a noisy channel potentially adversarial to the learning procedure. We posit an intermediate provider, e.g., a multiplexer or switch, which we call the <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Random Access Model (RAM)</span>, between users and the server. The RAM is responsible for relaying user model updates to the server by selecting a certain number of users to relay at each update (and communication) round.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The user selection criteria of the RAM remain unknown to both the server and users. Therefore, at least from the perspective of the server and users, the simplest approach to describe RAM user selection is by using a memoryless probabilistic model, i.e., the RAM spits out each user with some fixed probability, independently across communication rounds. In other words, the RAM acts as a stationary <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">erasure channel</span>, where at each round the updates of only one user survive, while the updates of the rest of the users are discarded, according to a fixed user selection distribution. That is, the RAM implements a possibly randomized user selection policy.
Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning Under Restricted User Availability" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> depicts this scheme, where the RAM allows only one user to relay its local model to the server each time. The server cannot intervene and works as a simple broadcaster.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Under this setting, we propose a FL approach which is agnostic to user selection implemented by the RAM, by extending the expected empirical loss to a weighted risk-aware objective, using the <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Conditional Value-at-Risk</span> (CVaR) over the (unknown) distribution dictating such selection of users. This approach is, to the best of our knowledge, new and results in a robust training algorithm
which exploits the structure of FedAvg, with <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">at most</span> identical computational, iteration and communication complexity, at the expense of tuning two additional hyper-parameters. Our approach demonstrates notably superior performance compared with standard FL, which struggles to achieve accurate data classification when operating under limited access to user updates. Our experimental evaluations take place on both synthetic and standard benchmark datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">As a motivating example we consider a toy logistic regression problem on 2D synthetic data in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Problem Setup ‣ Federated Learning Under Restricted User Availability" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Each user trains on distinct patterns; this setup may resemble, e.g., sensors at different locations, each observing features corresponding to those patterns. Even for an easily verifiable setting with three or four classes, we observe that standard FL fails to classify data from less frequent users, while the proposed approach succeeds at finding decision boundaries that correctly classify the data from all users. All experiments were performed under the same training conditions (number of global rounds, step sizes, etc.). This example is elaborated in detail in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 A Motivating Example ‣ 3 Proposed Approach ‣ Federated Learning Under Restricted User Availability" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>.

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The RAM provides an abstraction for capturing intricacies involved in the communication among network nodes in numerous networking applications. In the following, we discuss some relevant examples. More specifically, user participation with different relative frequencies naturally appears in the context of routing or switching. In this case, the RAM may embody a router or switch operating at the network layer, implementing some possibly randomized (steady-state) device selection policy, with the goal of routing numerous requests intelligently.
The RAM may also model the role of the MAC sub-layer of a data-link network layer in
managing access to a shared communication medium and potentially optimizing traffic prioritization for multiple users by, e.g., performing informed bandwidth allocation to different devices. Further, the RAM could describe potential user unavailability as an impact of network infrastructure at the physical layer. In this case, the RAM models the effects of varying traffic or interference patterns, resulting from allocating physical resources, such as power or frequency (carrier) directly.

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In all those setups, highly biased and non-uniform user selections may result naturally under common circumstances. These include, for instance, service provider imbalanced user priorities due to certain contracts or monetary constraints, geographical constraints (e.g., communication in rural areas or in underwater applications),
frequency band availability or scarcity in the physical layer, and opportunistic resource allocation policies. Additionally, user selection bias may be induced as a result of network outages and disruptions caused by environmental conditions, equipment failures, power outages, or even natural disasters, affecting user network access dramatically and thus causing non-uniformity in the availability of user data. Last but not least, user selection bias may result due to communication rate limitations caused by privacy concerns and censoring related to data from certain sources or of certain types.</span></p>

In contrast, the proposed algorithm allows the server to manage user selection bias by optimizing efficiently under data scarcity. Our algorithm can in fact systematically manage non-uniform user participation, by adaptively focusing more on less frequent users. This is possible by exploiting native properties of the CVaR. The proposed technical approach also shares some similarities with </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.8.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a><span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.9.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">]</span></cite><span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In this work, we studied FL under an unknown random access model (RAM) describing biased, non-uniform, skewed and/or restricted random user participation. Departing from the standard expected loss model, we proposed a new risk-aware objective constructed by taking the CVaR over the RAM distribution, resulting in an efficient training algorithm which is oblivious
to the RAM, but at the same time addresses
limited participation of infrequent users.
Through experimental evaluation on 2D synthetic, Mnist, and FashionMnist datasets, we have demonstrated that the proposed risk-aware approach brings substantial potential performance gains over standard FL relying on FedAvg which, to the best of our knowledge, is currently a state-of-the-art method for handling FL problems with no server intervention on user participation.
