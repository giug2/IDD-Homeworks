<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">In the medical field, multi-center collaborations are often sought to yield more generalizable findings by leveraging the heterogeneity of patient and clinical data. However, recent privacy regulations hinder the possibility to share data, and consequently, to come up with machine learning-based solutions that support diagnosis and prognosis.
Federated learning (FL) aims at sidestepping this limitation by bringing AI-based solutions to data owners and only sharing local AI models, or parts thereof, that need then to be aggregated.
However, most of the existing federated learning solutions are still at their infancy and show several shortcomings, from the lack of a reliable and effective aggregation scheme able to retain the knowledge learned locally to weak privacy preservation as real data may be reconstructed from model updates.
Furthermore, the majority of these approaches, especially those dealing with medical data, relies on a centralized distributed learning strategy that poses robustness, scalability and trust issues.
In this paper we present a federated and decentralized learning strategy, <em id="id9.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedER</em>, that, exploiting experience replay and generative adversarial concepts, effectively integrates features from local nodes, providing models able to generalize across multiple datasets while maintaining privacy.
FedER is tested on two tasks — tuberculosis and melanoma classification — using multiple datasets in order to simulate realistic <em id="id9.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-i.i.d.</em> medical data scenarios. Results show that our approach achieves performance comparable to standard (non-federated) learning and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art federated methods in their centralized (thus, more favourable) formulation.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advances of deep learning in the medical imaging domain have shown that, while data-driven approaches represent a powerful and promising tool for supporting physicians’ decisions, the availability of large-scale datasets plays a key role in the effectiveness and reliability of the resulting models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, the curation of large medical imaging datasets is a complex task: data collection at single institutions is relatively slow and the integration of historical data may require significant efforts to deal with different data formats, storage modalities and acquisition devices; moreover, medical institutions are often reluctant to share their own data, due to privacy concerns. As a consequence, this affects the quality, reliability and generalizability of models trained on local datasets, which unavoidably suffer from bias and overfitting issues, reducing the ability to address future data distribution shifts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In order to overcome the lack of large-scale datasets, methodological solutions can be adopted: in particular, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> encompasses a family of strategies for distributed training over multiple nodes, each with its own private dataset, which typically communicate with a central node by sending local model updates, used to train the main model. In this scenario, no data is explicitly shared between nodes, thus addressing the required privacy issues.
However, this family of techniques generally performs well when dataset distributions are approximately <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.i.d.</em> and local gradients/models contribute to learning shared features: unfortunately, in practice this hypothesis rarely holds, due to differences in the acquisition and in the clinical nature of data collected by multiple institutions. Moreover, the presence of a central node, besides representing a single point of failure, requires that all nodes trust it to correctly and fairly treat updates from all sources: indeed, privacy issues arise when transferring local updates to the “semi-honest” central node <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which might attempt to reconstruct original inputs from gradients or parameter variations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
To address the above limitations, we present <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedER</em>, a federated learning approach that, leveraging experience replay from continual learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and generative models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, proposes a principled way for training local models that approximately converge to the same decisions, without the need of a shared model architecture and of central coordination.
<em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedER</em> also enforces privacy preservation through the transmission of synthetic data generated in a way to obfuscate real data patterns.
<br class="ltx_break">Specifically, FedER’s learning strategy envisages multiple nodes that initially train their local models and a GAN on their own datasets. The GAN will be used in order to generate a privacy-preserving synthesized version of the dataset (buffer). Once local training is completed in a node, its model and the “buffer” of generated synthetic data are sent to a random node of the network. The receiving node then adapts the incoming model using its own data and the received buffer data, in order to limit model’s forgetting.
Data privacy is ensured through a privacy-preserving generative adversarial network (GAN) that employs a specific loss designed to maximize the distance from real data, while keeping a high level of realism and — as importantly — clinically-consistent features, in order to allow models to be trained effectively.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedER is tested on two tasks, simulating a <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-i.i.d.</em> medical scenario: 1) classification of tuberculosis from X-ray data, using Montgomery County and Shenzhen Hospital datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and 2) melanoma classification using skin images of the ISIC 2019 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The experimental setting is specifically designed to emulate a realistic medical <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-i.i.d.</em> scenario, where each node in the federation uses its own dataset. This is in stark contrast with common procedures where non-<em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.i.d.</em> distributions are simulated by splitting a single source dataset. Results show how our approach is able to reach performance similar to using centralized training on all real data together in a single node, while outperforming current state-of-the-art methods, such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Privacy-preserving capabilities are measured quantitatively by evaluating LPIPS distance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> between real images and samples generated, respectively, through latent space optimization on a standard GAN and by the proposed approach. Qualitatively, we also show several examples of generated images with corresponding closest match in the real dataset, demonstrating significant differences that prevent tracing back to the original real distribution.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> has recently emerged as a family of distributed learning strategies that allow nodes to keep training data private, while supporting the creation of a shared model. In a typical FL setting, a central server sends a model to a set of client nodes; each node fine-tunes the model on its own data, then sends local model updates back to the server; the server aggregates the updates by all nodes into the global model, which is sent back to nodes iteratively until convergence. Given the constraints existing in the medical domain, especially in terms of data sharing, it represents an appropriate test-bench for federated learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. The most straightforward way to aggregate information from multiple nodes is through averaging local models of each client, as proposed in FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. However, statistical data heterogeneity is an issue as it may lead to catastrophic forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. FedCurv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> addresses this limitation by adding a penalty term to the loss driving the local models to a shared optimum. FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> builds a shared global model in a layer-wise manner by matching and averaging hidden elements with similar feature extraction signatures.
Our method differs from existing feature integration approaches in that, instead of averaging model updates or gradients, which can be subject to input reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, each node attempts to learn features that perform well on its own dataset while retaining knowledge from other nodes, in a more principled way than parameter averaging.
The strategy of fitting the global model to local data is also sought by the recent federated <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized methods</span>. FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, for instance, keeps batch normalization layers private, while other model parameters are aggregated by the central node.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the presence of a central node that aggregates local updates simplifies the communication protocol when the number of clients is very large (thousands or millions), but introduces several downsides: it represents a single point of failure; it can become a bottleneck when the number of clients increases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>; in general, it may not always be available or desirable in collaborative learning scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we deal with <em id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">decentralized federated learning</em>, in which the central node is replaced by peer-to-peer communication between clients: there is no longer a global shared model as in standard FL, but the communication protocol is designed so that all local models approximately converge to the same solution. Decentralized learning is particularly suitable to application in the medical domain, where the number of nodes (i.e., institutions) is relatively low; however, research is still ongoing, and no effective solutions have been established. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, a Bayesian approach is proposed to learn a shared model over a graph of nodes, by aggregating information from local data with the model of each node’s one-hop neighbors. A secure weight averaging algorithm is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, where model parameters are not shared between nodes, but all converge to the same numerical values (with the disadvantages associated to parameter averaging with <em id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-i.i.d.</em> data distributions). Other approaches implement different communication strategies based on parameter sharing (e.g., decentralized variants on FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>). In general, many of the existing solutions do not target, nor are they tested on, the medical domains — most employ toy datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR10. Two works, similar in the decentralized learning spirit to ours, are proposed in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, where use cases of decentralized and swarm learning for medical image segmentation are presented. However, like other approaches, they adopt simple parameter averaging to integrate features or predictions from multiple nodes.</p>

The input model to the node is fine-tuned on both the private dataset and the buffer, in a way that is reminiscent of experience replay techniques in continual learning (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>), in order to learn features that transfer between nodes and that can handle non-<em id="S3.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.i.d.</em> distributions. At the end of each round (i.e., after performing several training iterations), the locally-trained model is sent to a randomly-chosen successor node together with a buffer of local synthetic samples, and the whole procedure is repeated.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current approaches for federated learning are mostly based on parameter averaging (e.g., FedAvg), which is, however, a straightforward way to combine knowledge from multiple sources: feature locations are not aligned over different models and may be disrupted by updates, before slowly converging to consensus: hypothetically, two models could learn the same set of features at different locations of the same layer, to only have them cancel each other when averaging. In a decentralized scenario, this issue is even exacerbated, due to the lack of an entity that enforces global agreement on node features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our approach, we address this problem by taking inspiration from continual learning strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> that learn how to perform a task with a non-<em id="S3.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.i.d</em> data stream without forgetting previously-learned knowledge: as a consequence, models are encouraged to reuse and adapt features so that they can equally serve the current and previous tasks. Analogously, in the federated learning setting, the objective is to train a global model trained on disjoint non-<em id="S3.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.i.d.</em> data distributions coming from different nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given these premises, we define a federated learning strategy where a node receives another node’s model and surrogate data (generated through our privacy-preserving GAN) — the <em id="S3.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">“previous task”</em> — and fine-tunes that model on its own private date — the <em id="S3.SS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">“current task”</em> — while using received synthetic data as a reference to what is necessary to retain/adapt from the knowledge learned by the previous
node. The idea is to build for each node a model able to tackle its internal data while not forgetting about the data seen in previous nodes/iterations.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We recall that GAN training is carried out <span id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">before</span> federated learning using training data only, while leaving out test samples, as mentioned in Sect. <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Datasets ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>.
Our privacy-preserving GAN employs StyleGAN2-ADA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> as a backbone, because of its suitability in low-data regimes and its generation capabilities. Training is carried out in two steps: 1) the GAN is initially trained without any privacy-preserving loss to support learning of high-quality visual features; 2) afterwards, we enable privacy-preserving loss and fine-tune the model in order to limit the embedding of patient-specific patterns in the GAN latent space.
For classification purposes, GANs are trained in a label-conditioned fashion with a mini-batch size of 32 and learning rate of 0.0025 for both the generator and the discriminator. Early-stopping criteria are based on the Frêchet Inception Distance (FID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> between real and synthetic distributions: in the first training step, we stop training if FID does not improve for 10,000 iterations; in the second training step, we employ a criterion which stops training if FID increases by a factor of 2.5 w.r.t. the value obtained in the first step.

In order to quantitatively evaluate privacy preservation, we also compute the average LPIPS distance between each real image and its closest synthetic sample by means of latent space projection (described in Sect. <a href="#S4.SS4" title="4.4 Privacy-preserving performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4</span></a>): the higher value of LPIPS, the lower the possibility to reconstruct real images from the generator.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We also compare FedER against standard training of the local node models, referred to as “Standalone” . Classification accuracy is computed using local node models on their own data. The results, reported in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2.1 Federated training ‣ 4.2 Training procedure and metrics ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, show that standalone training appears to be the most favourable scenario. Centralized strategies perform generally worse than standalone training, because of the non-<em id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.i.d.</em> nature of the data. However, when the centralized approach is trained with original data augmented with synthetic samples, its classification accuracy is on par with the standalone training, possibly due to the learned generative latent spaces that likely tend to smooth different modes of non-<em id="S4.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.i.d.</em> data. FedER, instead, outperforms its centralized counterpart and yields slightly worse performance (1.5 percent points less) than standalone training. Although this may appear, at a first glance, as a shortcoming of FedER, we recall that in a federated learning scenario, we aim at building a model that, leveraging multiple data distributions present in the federation, may generalize better, thus addressing possible future data drifts. In order to assess the capabilities of the trained models to achieve such a generalization, we measure the decision convergence by evaluating how a local node model performs on other node datasets. Results are in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2.2 GAN training ‣ 4.2 Training procedure and metrics ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and show a good average accuracy, with a low standard deviation, by FedER, indicating that each node model performs equally well on its own dataset and on the others (i.e., all node models converge to similar decisions). Conversely, standalone training yields significantly lower accuracy and higher standard deviation than ours, demonstrating to be an unsuitable strategy for the sought generalization properties.</p>

Results, for the tuberculosis and the melanoma tasks, are reported in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.3 Federated learning performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and show that FedER outperforms all methods under comparison. Interestingly, FedER learning strategy does better than: a) <span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">centralized methods</span>, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, suggesting that experience replay is a more effective feature aggregation approach than naive parameter averaging; b) personalized methods, such as FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which affects a limited aspect of feature representation (i.e., input layer distributions), while our approach adapts the entire model to local and remote tasks.
<br class="ltx_break">These above results suggest that experience replay plays a key role in federated models as a principled way to integrate features coming from different data distributions. To further assess its contribution, we evaluate FedER performance when using buffer at different sizes. Results on the tuberculosis task, measured as mean and standard deviation of the local node models over a given dataset, are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.3 Federated learning performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and indicate a clear contribution of the buffer in terms of overall performance and models’ agreement. Indeed, with no buffer we obtain the lowest average performance and the highest standard deviation. As the buffer is enabled, we can observe a performance gain (mainly for the Shenzhen dataset) and a significant drop in standard deviation. Performance improves as buffer size increases, although gain becomes negligible above 512. Since higher buffer sizes result in more data to be shared among nodes, we use a buffer size of 512, as the best trade-off between accuracy and communication costs.</p>

The histograms show that standard GAN training, with no privacy-preserving loss, tends to yield distances closer to 0, demonstrating that real images are indeed included into the generator latent space; while our model significantly mitigates this issue, by synthesizing samples that are substantially different than the original ones. In order to qualitatively substantiate these findings, Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Privacy-preserving performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> compares original samples from the Shenzhen dataset with the corresponding projections, generated with and without our privacy-preserving loss<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>We show only X-Ray synthesized samples, as the effect is of our privacy-preserving strategy, is more appreciable than in skin lesion data.</span></span></span>. It is easy to notice that generated samples with a traditional GAN highly resemble real data, making it impossible to share such samples, albeit synthetic, in a privacy-safe manner, as they clearly contain patient information.
Instead, comparing real images with the projections obtained from privacy-preserving GAN confirms the inability of the generator to find latent representations that recover real images used during training.</p>

It can be noted that FedER-A (i.e., “buffer-only sharing”) configuration achieves comparable performance to our standard FedER (82.76 vs 83.41), but, remarkably, it outperforms all existing federated learning methods on the same datasets (compare Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.3 Federated learning performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> with the node performance block in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.4 Privacy-preserving performance ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ FedER: Federated Learning through Experience Replay and Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>). The FedER-B (i.e., “synthetic-only training”) configuration, instead, performs slightly worse than the other two configurations, but is still on par with existing federated methods.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As for <em id="S4.SS5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">computational costs</em> of federated training, FedER incurs the same overhead for parameter optimization and aggregation as state-of-the-art methods.
Additionally, before federated training starts, FedER requires that each node trains a local privacy-preserving GAN off-line; this, however, does not affect online federated learning costs, as it is carried out only once at the very beginning of the whole procedure.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we argue that, in the medical domain, the number of institutions in a federation is relatively low and it is reasonable to assume that nodes can benefit from a powerful communication network and computing infrastructure: thus, the overhead introduced by FedER is tolerable, in light of the methodological advantages and the obtained performance and generalization capabilities showed by the resulting models.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose FedER, a decentralized federated learning framework that replaces traditional parameters averaging with a more principled feature integration approach based on the combination of experience replay and privacy-preserving generative models. In FedER, nodes communicate with each other by sharing local models and buffers of synthetic samples; local model updates are carried out in a way that encourages the reuse and adaptation of features learned by other nodes, thus avoiding potentially disruptive effects due to blind feature averaging. Experimental results show that our method outperforms significantly state-of-the-art centralized approaches in a non-<em id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.i.d.</em> scenario, which is a typical setting in the medical domain. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that our privacy-preserving generation approach is able to synthesize samples that are significantly different from real data, while correctly supporting the learning of discriminative features. In the future, we aim at investigating some unexplored properties of our method: for instance, unlike all other existing methods based on parameter averaging is required, our approach does not strictly require that all nodes share the same model architecture. Model heterogeneity could therefore be employed to create a shared ensemble and combine different feature learning capabilities.</p>
