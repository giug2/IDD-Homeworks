<p id="id3.2" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to learn a global model collaboratively without sharing their private data. However, the effectiveness of FL is highly dependent on the quality of the data that is being used for training. In particular, data heterogeneity issues, such as label distribution skew and feature skew, can significantly impact the performance of FL.
Previous studies in FL have primarily focused on addressing label distribution skew data heterogeneity, while only a few recent works have made initial progress in tackling feature skew issues. Notably, these two forms of data heterogeneity have been studied separately and have not been well explored within a unified FL framework.
To address this gap, we propose Fed-CO<sub id="id3.2.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="id3.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub>, a universal FL framework that handles both label distribution skew and feature skew within a <span id="id3.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">C</span>ooperation mechanism between the <span id="id3.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">O</span>nline and <span id="id3.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">O</span>ffline models. Specifically, the online model learns general knowledge that is shared among all clients, while the offline model is trained locally to learn the specialized knowledge of each individual client.
To further enhance model cooperation in the presence of feature shifts, we design an intra-client knowledge transfer mechanism that reinforces mutual learning between the online and offline models, and an inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism to increase the models’ domain generalization ability.
Extensive experiments show that our Fed-CO<sub id="id3.2.5" class="ltx_sub"><span id="id3.2.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> outperforms a wide range of existing personalized federated learning algorithms in terms of handling label distribution skew and feature skew, both individually and collectively. The empirical results are supported by our convergence analyses in a simplified setting.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a distributed learning framework that involves collaboratively training a global model with multiple clients while ensuring privacy protection.
The pioneering work FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> learns the global model by aggregating the local client models and obtains satisfactory performance when the client data are independently and identically distributed (IID).
However, when the data are heterogeneous and non-IID among clients, performance with the global model can degrade substantially <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Common data heterogeneity issues include label distribution skew and feature skew. Clients experiencing label distribution skew exhibit varying class distributions within the same domain, while clients encountering feature skew maintain consistent class distributions but belong to different domains.
As a promising solution to data heterogeneity issues, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged, where personalized models are trained for individual clients.
Most previous studies have focused on addressing label distribution skew <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, while only a few recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> have made initial progress in tackling feature shift issues.
So far, these two forms of data heterogeneity have been studied separately and have not been addressed within a unified FL framework.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a universal FL framework that effectively handles data heterogeneity issues arising from label distribution skew, feature skew, or their combination.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several algorithms personalized some parts of the model in FL with label distribution imbalance or feature shifts to retain and leverage some of the local offline information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
However, in realistic FL scenarios, where extreme label distribution skew, severe feature skew, or even both are present, these algorithms fail to effectively harness local specialized knowledge for satisfactory adaptation.
In fact, in some cases of extreme heterogeneity, models trained by those personalized algorithms may even perform worse than the locally-trained model, as the locally-trained model excels in capturing offline specialized knowledge.
On the other hand, in FL scenarios with milder heterogeneity, partially personalized models trained by PFL algorithms perform better due to their ability to access online general information from other clients.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">So, given that the model with partially personalized parameters and the locally trained model each perform better in different cases, the question is: Is there a more effective approach to fuse the online general knowledge and the offline specialized knowledge for better performance?
From our investigations, the answer is yes. Accordingly, we propose a novel universal cooperation framework with these two models to address this challenge for both label distribution skew and feature skew data heterogeneity, referring to the model with partially personalized parameters as the online model, and the locally trained model as the offline model.
Specifically, we personalize Batch Normalization layers in the online model and fuse the online and offline models’ predictions as the final prediction.
The prediction fusion between the online and offline models rectifies errors in their respective individual predictions and exhibits better performance.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In FL scenarios with feature skew, the general knowledge learned by the online model is domain-invariant, whereas the specialized knowledge learned by the offline model is domain-specific.
Cooperation that occurs solely by fusing predictions is not sufficient as this process does not let the online and offline models communicate during the training phase.
In turn, this impedes the transfer of domain-invariant and domain-specific knowledge between the models.
Hence, to further encourage cooperation between the models, we propose two novel knowledge transfer mechanisms - one intra-client and one inter-client - which work at the model and client level, respectively.
The intra-client knowledge transfer mechanism facilitates mutual learning between the online and offline models via knowledge distillation, which enables the online and offline models to benefit from both online domain-invariant and offline domain-specific knowledge.
Conversely, the inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism enhances the model’s domain generalization ability by introducing classifiers from the offline models of other clients to each local client.

We propose Fed-CO<sub id="S1.p5.5.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S1.p5.5.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub>, a universal cooperative FL framework for severe data heterogeneity including both label distribution skew and feature skew.
By simply fusing the online and offline models, Fed-CO<sub id="S1.p5.5.3" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S1.p5.5.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> can handle severe label distribution skew effectively.
To enhance model performance in the presence of severe feature skew, Fed-CO<sub id="S1.p5.5.4" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S1.p5.5.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> involves an intra-client knowledge transfer mechanism that improves model cooperation and an inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism that increases client cooperation.
We theoretically show that Fed-CO<sub id="S1.p5.5.5" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S1.p5.5.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> has a faster convergence rate than FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> in a simplified setting.

In real-world FL scenarios, label distribution imbalance among clients is a common phenomenon that poses challenges to learning a single model that can effectively cater to all clients.
A straightforward approach to personalizing the global model is fine-tuning it on local datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
Other approaches attempt to overcome distribution heterogeneity by exerting a proximal regularization term on the global model, as seen in examples like FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, pFedMe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and Ditto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Instead of adapting the single global model, learning personalized models is another main track. Here, the more explicit methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> personalize some of the model parameters while leaving other parameters for aggregation.
Similarly, FedMask <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> learns distinct binary masks for the last several layers of the local models.
Further, inspired by Hypernetworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, some methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> apply a hypernetwork to produce client-specific parameters for participants.
Beyond directly personalizing parts of the model parameters, some of the newer methods involve a two-branch architecture where the aim is to calibrate the model’s predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. For example, FedRoD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> uses a personal head to strengthen local learning, while PerFCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> splits the features in the local clients into shared parts and personalized parts.
FedProc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> uses prototypes as global knowledge to correct local training.
However, unlike these methods,
Fed-CO<sub id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S2.p1.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> maintains two separate personalized models for each client – one that learns online general knowledge and the other that learns offline specialized knowledge – with a focus on facilitating cooperation between the two models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, knowledge distillation, which transfers dark knowledge between models, has played an important role in addressing label distribution skew <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
Most of previous works in this arena rely heavily on a public dataset to transfer knowledge between the server and the local clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Only a limited number of studies have delved into the synergistic interplay between learning global knowledge and learning local knowledge, as well as strategies to optimize the mutual benefits of these two processes.
In FML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the global model and the local model engage in mutual learning, but only the local model is used for personalized predictions.
A very recent study, CD<sup id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S2.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sup>-pFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, employs cyclical distillation as a regularization term in conjunction with the local training cross-entropy loss to mitigate the gaps between the learned representations from local weights and those from global weights.
By contrast, our method utilizes knowledge distillation to facilitate the exchange of beneficial knowledge between the online and offline models before local training, as well as to ensure effective and adequate intra-client knowledge transfer.</p>

While various methods have shown promising results on label distribution data heterogeneity, they often suffer from significant performance degradation when confronted with the more challenging feature shift data heterogeneity.
To adapt to the feature shifts among different domains, FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> personalizes Batch Normalization (BN) layers for each participant.
Beyond personalizing BN layers, PartialFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> explores the strategy of selecting personalized parameters based on the feature characteristics of different clients.
To handle the feature skew, FedAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> learns the similarities between participants by analyzing their private parameters in the BN layers.
In a recent work called TrFedDis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, the concept of feature disentangling is used to capture both domain-invariant and domain-specific knowledge.
Our Fed-CO<sub id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S2.p3.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> deviates from such disentangling approaches and instead focuses on facilitating mutual learning between the online and offline models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When feature skew data heterogeneity is present, relying solely on prediction fusion for cooperation is insufficient.
This approach fails the communication between the online and offline models during the training phase, impeding the transfer of online domain-invariant and offline domain-specific knowledge.
Therefore, to enhance collaboration among the models in FL with feature skew, we propose novel intra-client and inter-client knowledge transfer mechanisms.
In the next two parts, we will introduce these mechanisms and discuss their role.</p>

Unlike previous algorithms that utilized a two-branch framework, aiming to make the knowledge learned by each branch as disjoint as possible through methods such as Contrastive Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> or Feature Disentangling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, we introduce a novel intra-client knowledge transfer mechanism to enhance the collaboration of the two models.
This mechanism employs knowledge distillation to facilitate mutual learning between the two models during the training phase.

As a result, neither of the two goals can be fully accomplished.
Furthermore, during local training, there is a risk of the online model losing general domain-invariant knowledge, which leads to a reduction in the amount of valuable information accessible to the offline model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.6" class="ltx_p">To address these challenges, we divide the local training process into two distinct phases: a mutual learning phase and a local adaptation phase to achieve their respective goals.
Concretely, in the mutual learning phase, we create a duplicate of the initial online model, which consists of its personalized BNs from the last round and other parameters updated with the global aggregation model.
Additionally, we retain a copy of the initial offline model from the last round.

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After the intra-client knowledge transfer in the first phase, both the online and offline models have gained beneficial knowledge from each other, and now it is opportune to let them adapt to the local data distributions.
The pertinent question is whether we can leverage additional knowledge from other clients to bridge the domain gaps in the local training.
Currently, the approach of acquiring knowledge from other clients is limited to aggregating shared parameters on the server.
In comparison to various advanced approaches used in Domain Generalization (DG) research, parameter aggregation alone may struggle to learn effective domain-invariant features.
The primary challenge stems from the isolation of private data, as FL prohibits cross-client access to data from other domains.
Without data from multiple domains, it is tough to directly apply techniques in DG.</p>

<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering that the offline model in each client is trained to capture local specialized domain-specific knowledge, we propose to leverage these lightweight classifiers of the offline model to transfer domain knowledge among clients, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Fed-CO2: Cooperation of Online and Offline Models for Severe Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(c).
The classifiers of the offline model from other clients are introduced to each local client, enabling the feature extractors of its online and offline models to generate robust and well-generalized features that can be effectively recognized by these introduced classifiers.
We share similar design intuitions with COPA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, but here our inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism stresses more on making use of knowledge from other clients to benefit the personalized model for each client rather than serving unseen novel clients.</p>

Specifically, we considered two different label distributions among participants: 1) Pathological Distribution, each client is randomly assigned 2 classes per client in CIFAR10 (10 classes per client in CIFAR100); 2) Dirichlet Distribution,
each client gets its private data through partitioning of the datasets using a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with a default parameter <math id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha=0.3" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">α</mi><mo id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">0.3</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝛼</ci><cn type="float" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">0.3</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\alpha=0.3</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For feature skew heterogeneity, we conducted extensive experiments on three datasets: Digits, Office-Caltech10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and DomainNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
In this non-IID data setting, each domain serves as a client, with each client having access to all the data from its respective domain.
Digits is composed of 5 different digit datasets with feature shift: SVHN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, USPS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, SynthDigits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, MNIST-M <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> and MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.
Office-Caltech10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> owns data from four different domains including Amazon, DSLR, WebCam, and Caltech-256.
DomainNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> is a challenging dataset that comprises six distinct domains, namely Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch.
To explore the more realistic FL scenarios with both label distribution skew and feature skew, we exert a Dirichlet Distribution to datasets with feature shift.

our Fed-CO<sub id="S5.SS2.p3.3.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS2.p3.3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art PFL algorithms in terms of average test accuracy across almost all cases in experiments with label distribution skew.
Our state-of-the-art results across almost all cases prove that our method can more effectively excavate and utilize local information to overcome data heterogeneity caused by label distribution imbalance than previous methods.
It is worth highlighting that our Fed-CO<sub id="S5.SS2.p3.3.3" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS2.p3.3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> outperforms both SingleSet and FedBN, regardless of which one performs better individually.
This observation confirms that Fed-CO<sub id="S5.SS2.p3.3.4" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS2.p3.3.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> effectively integrates the general knowledge obtained by the online model and the specialized knowledge acquired by the offline model, resulting in enhanced performance.</p>

We exhibit the experiment results on Digits in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.2 Performance Evaluation ‣ 5 EXPERIMENTS ‣ Fed-CO2: Cooperation of Online and Offline Models for Severe Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, where we exerted a Dirichlet Distribution on each client with <math id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha=0.3" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">α</mi><mo id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">0.3</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.2">𝛼</ci><cn type="float" id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1.1.3">0.3</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p4.2.m2.1c">\alpha=0.3</annotation></semantics></math>.
From the results, it is evident that, even in the presence of two types of data heterogeneity, our Fed-CO<sub id="S5.SS2.p4.3.3" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS2.p4.3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> outperforms various state-of-the-art algorithms with a significant margin in every sub-dataset.
Therefore, we can conclude that under our universal cooperation framework, local clients not only make the most use of their local offline information but also benefit from the general knowledge shared by other clients for a better adaptation to local data, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in FL with both label distribution skew and feature skew.

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the presence of feature skew, we add intra-client and inter-client knowledge transfer mechanisms to foster the collaboration between the online and offline models for better local adaptation.
Here, we evaluate the efficacy of these two knowledge transfer mechanisms on the challenging DomainNet dataset through three additional experiments, as presented in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 5.3 Component Analysis ‣ 5 EXPERIMENTS ‣ Fed-CO2: Cooperation of Online and Offline Models for Severe Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
In these experiments, we selectively removed specific mechanisms from Fed-CO<sub id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS3.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> to investigate their individual contributions and functionalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.2" class="ltx_p">According to the experimental results, we can observe that: 1)
In the absence of intra-client and inter-client knowledge transfer mechanisms, Fed-CO<sub id="S5.SS3.p2.2.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS3.p2.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> exhibits a significant decline in performance, resulting in a performance level comparable to that of benchmark methods.
Therefore, cooperation relying solely on prediction fusion proves to be inadequate for FL with feature skew.
2)
The removal of either the intra-client or the inter-client knowledge transfer mechanisms will also result in an average decline in performance.
This phenomenon validates the effectiveness of our intra-client and inter-client knowledge transfer mechanisms, both of which contribute to enhancing the models’ capability to adapt to local data distributions.
3)
Compared with all three ablation experiments, our Fed-CO<sub id="S5.SS3.p2.2.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S5.SS3.p2.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> consistently achieves the highest performance on average and across the majority of sub-datasets.
These results firmly demonstrate that our cooperation framework effectively leverages both model-level and client-level collaboration through the intra-client knowledge transfer and inter-client knowledge transfer mechanisms, respectively, to adapt to feature shifts resulting from domain gaps.
Further analysis of these two cooperation mechanisms is supplemented in the Appendix.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed a new universal FL framework called Fed-CO<sub id="S6.p1.3.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S6.p1.3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> that is capable of handling label distribution skew and feature skew even when both are present in the same data.
The core of our approach is to foster cooperation between the online and offline models, leveraging the benefits of online general knowledge and offline specialized knowledge to effectively adapt to local data distribution.
To improve model collaboration in FL with feature shifts, we designed two novel knowledge transfer mechanisms: one intra-client and the other inter-client.
These mechanisms facilitate mutual learning between the online and offline models, concurrently enhancing the model’s capacity to generalize across different domains.
Comparisons with a wide range of state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets consistently show that Fed-CO<sub id="S6.p1.3.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S6.p1.3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> yields superior performance in addressing both label distribution skew and feature skew challenges, both individually and in combination. Extending Fed-CO<sub id="S6.p1.3.3" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S6.p1.3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> to scenarios with noisy training data is under consideration in our future work.</p>

<p id="A1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We adopted the setting used in FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> for feature skew heterogeneity, which involved adjusting the local training batch size to 32 to maintain consistency.
Additionally, we followed the implementation of selecting only the top 10 classes based on data amount from DomainNet to create the dataset for our experiments.
For experiments with label distribution skew and feature skew, we partitioned each sub-dataset into several parts with a Dirichlet Distribution and selected one part as the new training set.
Then we adjusted the label distribution in the test set to the same distribution in the new training set.
Specifically, based on the number of training images in each dataset, we divided each sub-dataset in Digits into three parts, each sub-dataset in Office-Caltech10 into two parts, and each sub-dataset in DomainNet into five parts.

We trained every algorithm with 1500 communication rounds.
Meanwhile, in experiments about feature skew non-iid heterogeneity, all clients participated in each communication round and every algorithm was trained with 300 communication rounds.
All training tasks were optimized with an SGD optimizer with the default learning rate 0.01. We used PyTorch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> to implement our algorithms with an RTX 2080 Ti GPU.</p>

It can be observed that when facing two severe forms of data heterogeneity, algorithms demonstrated significantly lower performance on Office-Caltech10 and DomainNet compared to FL scenarios with feature skew alone.
Even in such a challenging task, our Fed-CO<sub id="A5.p2.4.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A5.p2.4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> still achieves the highest average accuracy and outperforms locally-trained models.
This result proves that Fed-CO<sub id="A5.p2.4.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A5.p2.4.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> succeeds in making use of both general domain-invariant and specialized domain-specific knowledge to adapt to extreme local data heterogeneity.</p>

In these experiments, we compared the model trained by our Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS1.p2.3.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS1.p2.3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> with its online and offline models.</p>

It is evident that the online model outperforms the offline model when the label distribution imbalance is moderate, while the offline model excels when the imbalance is severe.
Across all extensive experiments, Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS1.p3.4.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS1.p3.4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> consistently surpasses both the standalone online model and the standalone offline model in terms of test accuracy statistics, exhibiting higher average and median values.
At the client level, Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS1.p3.4.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS1.p3.4.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> improves prediction accuracy for the majority of local clients.
Although Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS1.p3.4.3" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS1.p3.4.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> may not surpass the superior model between the online and offline models on a limited number of clients, it consistently outperforms the weaker model and achieves performance levels approaching that of the superior model.
Therefore, we can conclude that our collaborative FL framework, Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS1.p3.4.4" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS1.p3.4.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub>, which combines the strengths of online and offline models, is exceptionally effective.

For FL with feature skew, we conducted experiments that evaluate the performance of the online and offline models on DomainNet.
Based on the experimental results shown in Table <a href="#A6.T10" title="Table 10 ‣ F.1 Effectiveness of Cooperation Framework ‣ Appendix F Additional Experiments and Analyses ‣ Fed-CO2: Cooperation of Online and Offline Models for Severe Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, we have the following observations: First, the online model outperforms the offline model on most clients, except for the Quickdraw client. This phenomenon validates our hypothesis that when the feature shift is severe, the model aggregation will lead to the loss of important local offline information, resulting in the model’s failure to adapt to such significant data heterogeneity. Second, prediction fusion is even inferior to the online and offline models for some clients. This result reflects that prediction fusion is not sufficient to fuse online general knowledge and offline specialized knowledge in FL with severe data heterogeneity issues.
Therefore, for FL with feature skew, intra-client and inter-client knowledge transfer mechanisms are required to boost model and client cooperation under our novel framework.</p>

<p id="A6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in the main paper, intra-client and inter-client knowledge transfer mechanisms foster model-level and client-level collaboration to better make use of general domain-invariant and specialized domain-specific knowledge for a better adaptation to local data distribution.
In this section, we did further ablation studies on the challenging DomainNet dataset to investigate two mechanisms from a fine-grained angle.</p>

<p id="A6.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="A6.SS2.p2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ablation Study in Intra-client Knowledge Transfer Mechanism.</span>
In this section, we investigated the impact of the intra-client knowledge transfer mechanism on the online and offline models by excluding the inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism from Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS2.p2.2.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS2.p2.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub>.
Specifically, we performed separate intra-client knowledge transfers: from the offline model to the online model and from the online model to the offline model.
The results are demonstrated in Table <a href="#A6.T11" title="Table 11 ‣ F.2 Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms in Feature Skew ‣ Appendix F Additional Experiments and Analyses ‣ Fed-CO2: Cooperation of Online and Offline Models for Severe Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> and we can discover that knowledge transfer is beneficial to both online and offline models.
By transferring specialized domain-specific knowledge to the online model, we can observe an improvement in the performance of the Quickdraw client, which has a more extreme non-IID data distribution and relies more on local offline information.
Conversely, when transferring general domain-invariant knowledge to the offline model, we could notice enhanced performance in the remaining clients that present milder data heterogeneity and require more global information.
Hence, by incorporating the full intra-client knowledge transfer mechanism, our Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS2.p2.2.3" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS2.p2.2.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> effectively utilizes both online domain-invariant and offline domain-specific knowledge, resulting in improved average test accuracy.</p>

In this part, we removed the intra-client knowledge transfer mechanism from Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS2.p3.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> and did experiments to investigate the impact of inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism on online and offline models.
The experiments included exerting inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism on the online model, the offline model, and both models. Table <a href="#A6.T12" title="Table 12 ‣ F.2 Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms in Feature Skew ‣ Appendix F Additional Experiments and Analyses ‣ Fed-CO2: Cooperation of Online and Offline Models for Severe Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a> presents the experimental results.
The results demonstrate that knowledge from other domains benefits both the online and offline models, with the online model showing more remarkable improvement.
This observation aligns consistently with the purpose of the online model, which focuses on acquiring general domain-invariant knowledge that can be applied across various domains.
Furthermore, the application of the inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism to both the online and offline models yields optimal performance, which means simultaneously enhancing domain generalization ability for online and offline models can exploit domain-invariant knowledge more effectively.
In summary, our inter-client knowledge transfer mechanism enables each local client to acquire and exploit more domain-invariant knowledge resulting in a better adaptation to local data distribution.

<p id="A6.SS3.p1.4" class="ltx_p">Noise is another common factor causing data heterogeneity issues in real FL scenarios, where each client has the same label distribution but is subject to various degrees of noise.
Therefore, we implemented additional experiments on this new scenario to make the initial attempt. In detail, we divided the dataset CIFAR10 into 10 clients in a way to make them independently and identically distributed. Then we applied the increasing level of random Gaussian noise with mean <math id="A6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu_{i}=0" display="inline"><semantics id="A6.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow

<p id="A6.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to enhance the adaptation to local data distribution, it is necessary to personalize certain critical parameters in the online model to preserve the essential offline specialized knowledge.
In this section, we investigated and analyzed which specific parts of our online model should be personalized for optimal performance in FL with feature skew.
The most common strategy is to personalize Batch Normalization layers or the Classifier Head.
Therefore in our Fed-CO<sub id="A6.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sub"><span id="A6.SS5.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sub> approach, we conducted three experiments with different personalized components in the online model to compare and determine the optimal strategy.
The results for three datasets, namely DomainNet, Office-Caltech10, and Digits, are illustrated in Fig. <a href="#A6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ F.5 Personalized Parts in the Online model ‣ Appendix F Additional Experiments and Analyses ‣ Fed-CO2: Cooperation of Online and Offline Models for Severe Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.
It is evident from the observations that personalizing the Classification Head has a negative impact on almost every sub-dataset, resulting in lower classification accuracy.
Based on the results, we can conclude that personalizing Batch Normalization layers in our online model is the best strategy to adapt to feature shifts.</p>
