<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Specializing Directed Acyclic Graph Federated Learning(SDAGFL) is a new federated learning framework which updates model from the devices with similar data distribution through Directed Acyclic Graph Distributed Ledger Technology (DAG-DLT). SDAGFL has the advantage of personalization, resisting single point of failure and poisoning attack in fully decentralized federated learning. Because of these advantages, the SDAGFL is suitable for the federated learning in IoT scenario where the device is usually battery-powered. To promote the application of SDAGFL in IoT, we propose an energy optimized SDAGFL based event-triggered communication mechanism, called ESDAGFL. In ESDAGFL, the new model is broadcasted only when it is significantly changed. We evaluate the ESDAGFL on a clustered synthetically FEMNIST dataset and a dataset from texts by Shakespeare and Goethe’s works. The experiment results show that our approach can reduce energy consumption by 33% compared with SDAGFL, and realize the same balance between training accuracy and specialization as SDAGFL.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the Internet of Things(IoT) development, data have become more diversified and distributed, stimulating the demand for privacy and security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. As a result, traditional centralized cloud-based machine learning has been challenged. A few machine learning techniques have been proposed to meet these challenges. A technique called Federated Learning (FL)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> provides a promising solution that allows the clients to work together to build a global machine learning model without sharing the local data on their own devices. A typical federated learning framework consists of a server and some local clients. The clients in FL can access the same global model and train it using local data. Then, they update the trained local model to the server. Once the locally trained models are received, the server will aggregate them as a new global model and feed it back to the clients for the next local update. FL will repeat this process several rounds until the global model converges or the number of repetitions meets the predetermined target.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this way, the client can protect data privacy as FL implements model training without collecting user data. Nevertheless, there are still some challenges in Federated Learning as follows:</p>

The clients with higher computing power and network bandwidth can complete the local training faster than the others. Thus, the server will wait a long time until the slowest client to complete the local training before starting the next round.

In the SDAGFL, the participating clients use a DAG for the communication of models and an accuracy-biased random walk to obtain the models from other devices with similar data distribution to update their local model. It not only achieves overcoming the challenges of device heterogeneity, failure of a single point, and poisoning attack but also creates a balance between reaching a consensus on a generalized model and personalizing the model to the clients different from the traditional FL framework where all the participating clients training and reaching consensus for a global model together.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DAG-based Federated Learning is inspired by the DAG Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The DAG-DLT can achieve consensus Similar to the Nakamoto DLT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which is also called blockchain, in a distributed system. The DAG-DLT uses a DAG data structure to store the transactions, allowing multiple transactions to be added to the ledger simultaneously. As a result, the DAG-DLT is considered suitable for the scenario that includes many distributed devices. The Tangle<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> created by the IOTA foundation is a typical DAG-DLT designed for the devices of the Internet of Things to participate in a low-energy network. The Tangle has a higher Transaction Per Second (TPS) than the blockchain because the transactions in the Tangle can be confirmed within minutes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Because the Tangle has the advantages of high TPS, low energy usage, and decentralization, it has received the researchers’ extensive attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Four Tangle-based federated learning frameworks have been proposed as far as we know. Cao et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> deployed a federated learning framework with Tangle called DAG-FL. DAG-FL includes three layers: the federated learning layer, the DAG layer, and the application layer, and it implements federated learning with asynchronous training and anomaly detection features. Shuo Yuan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed ChainsFL, a two-layer hierarchical federated learning framework combining the Tangle and blockchain. The ChainsFL consists of a sub-ledger, the Raft <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>-based Hyperledger Fabric <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, deployed on edge nodes, and a Tangle-based master ledger. The ChainsFL has overcome the disadvantages of massive resource consumption and limited throughput in traditional blockchain-based FL. In addition, Schmid Robert et al. discussed the basic applicability of the combination of federated learning and the Tangle in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. They assumed a long-standing open network for continuous learning and development. In this framework, the tip selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain in the Tangle is used to implement model selection. The averaged model is used to update the model. The evaluation of this framework shows the high training accuracy and model-agnostic resistance against random poisoning and label-flipping attacks. Beilharz et al. further optimized the framework in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. They proposed an implicit model specialization framework for federated learning called Specializing DAG Federated Learning(SDAGFL). In SDAGFL, the implicit clustering of clients with a similar local dataset is achieved through the accuracy-biased random walk on DAG-DLT and Fedavg algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The above four frameworks show that the integration of the Tangle with federated learning can implement asynchronous training and poisoning attack resistance. What is better than the other three works, SDAGFL further sufficiently uses the DAG data structure’s feature, and an accuracy-biased random walk for model update realizes implicit clustering of the client. Thus, we think the SDAGFL, which uses adaptive device and data heterogeneity, resistant poisoning attack, and personal federated learning, is worthy of more study.</p>

The confidence is the number of the site node selected during the multiple random walks. And the rating is the number of nodes that directly and indirectly approved by every site node. Thus, the energy cost of this process contains two aspects: confidence computing and rating computing. Thus, the energy consumption of the client obtaining the “Reference Model” can be expressed as follows.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the traditional FL, ESDAGFL is a fully asynchronous federated learning framework without any central server. It realizes the training target through each client runs the training process continuously and independently as long as its resources permit. Therefore, the concept of the rounds is introduced to enable a better demonstration of the experimental results.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the clients are assigned to the same process and in our simulation experiments. Thus, the energy consumption can be considered directly proportional to the training time. We use the energy consumption of the process “client obtains two tip nodes” as an example.

The training time per round in baseline grows linearly. However, our approach’s training time per round grows subconsciously and slowly. The time growth in our approach is mainly due to the time increases of the accuracy-biased random walk because of the increases in DAG-DLT. The total training time are reduced by 34% and 33% for the handwriting recognition task and next character prediction task, respectively.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Specializing DAG federated learning is a new paradigm of federated learning. In this work, we analyze the energy consumption of SDAGFL for the IoT scenario. Based on the formulated energy consumption analysis, we proposed an event-triggered communication-based SDAGFL approach, called ESDAGFL, to reduce the energy consumption of SDAGFL. The client participates in the ESDAGFL publishes the trained model only when it significantly changes from the averaged model. We evaluate our proposed approach on the FMNIST-clustered and Poets datasets. The experiments show that our method can realize reducing 33% energy consumption compared with SDAGFL. It can reach an equal balance between the model’s performance and specialization as SDAGFL. We will research the dynamic adjustment of trigger thresholds in ESDAGFL and communication overhead optimization in SDAGFL.</p>
