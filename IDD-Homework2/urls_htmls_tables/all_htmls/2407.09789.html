<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">Generating synthetic samples from the convex space of the minority class is a popular oversampling approach for imbalanced classification problems. Recently, deep-learning approaches have been successfully applied to modeling the convex space of minority samples. Beyond oversampling, learning the convex space of neighborhoods in training data has not been used to generate entire tabular datasets.
In this paper, we introduce a deep learning architecture (NextConvGeN) with a generator and discriminator component that can generate synthetic samples by learning to model the convex space of tabular data. The generator takes data neighborhoods as input and creates synthetic samples within the convex space of that neighborhood. Thereafter, the discriminator tries to classify these synthetic samples against a randomly sampled batch of data from the rest of the data space.
We compared our proposed model with five state-of-the-art tabular generative models across ten publicly available datasets from the biomedical domain. Our analysis reveals that synthetic samples generated by NextConvGeN can better preserve classification and clustering performance across real and synthetic data than other synthetic data generation models. Synthetic data generation by deep learning of the convex space produces high scores for popular utility measures.
We further compared how diverse synthetic data generation strategies perform in the privacy-utility spectrum and produced critical arguments on the necessity of high utility models. Our research on deep learning of the convex space of tabular data opens up opportunities in clinical research, machine learning model development, decision support systems, and clinical data sharing.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We previously introduced models that utilize convex space learning to overcome imbalanced classification problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In these models, depending on the data distribution, synthetic samples are generated from specific regions of the minority class’s convex space, customized using linear interpolation on original samples. A convex space is the convex hull of the data space. The data points within a convex hull of a small neighborhood in the data space are assumed to share similar statistical characteristics in the convex space learning philosophy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The idea of convex space learning is to generate synthetic samples from appropriate regions of the convex space of the original data. The appropriate regions depend on the dataset and the task at hand, and such regions are ‘learned.’ For learning, traditional oversampling approaches use predefined rules that specify which regions of the convex space are appropriate for synthetic sample generation. However, these models are currently limited to skewed or imbalanced datasets with a clear distinction between majority and minority classes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, a convex space learning-based deep neural network model developed to tackle the imbalance issue in tabular data is the ConvGeN model by Schultz <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>published on <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Patter Recognition</span> journal. This model merges the convex space learning technique with deep generative modeling to create synthetic samples that balance the target classes for tabular data. The oversampling results with ConvGeN have been significant, at par with the state-of-the-art oversampling methods for imbalanced classification. However, this model was not generalized for the complete table generation. Following upon this, we broadened the application of the ConvGeN model beyond just imbalanced learning. We have adapted the model in a more general setting, exploring its potential for generating entire tabular data with diverse feature types.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Note that oversampling for imbalanced datasets is nothing but synthetic data generation. In the context of synthetic data generation, data modalities such as images or text are more popular. Significant progress has been made in synthetic data generation for computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering exciting possibilities for clinical research. Among the most commonly used models in computer vision are Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, synthetic data generation models have also been developed for tabular data, a widely used format for organizing and analyzing information consisting of rows and columns. Each column in a table represents a specific feature or attribute of the samples in rows <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. With well-defined features and an interpretable structure, clinical tabular data leads to more interpretable models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, in certain domains, such as bio-medicine, tabular data are subject to privacy. Therefore, access to data with confidential patient information, which includes sensitive medical records and personal identifiers, is difficult <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Such data must be protected to meet the requirements of privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Moreover, even when access is granted, the scale of available clinical data may only sometimes meet the requirements of modern data-driven approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Tabular synthetic data generation strategies are recently gaining popularity to counter challenges related to data privacy and data enrichment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The idea is to generate synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of real-world clinical data. If the synthetic data is shared instead of the real data, then ideally, there is no breach of privacy. However, there is an important point to note here. If the synthetic data is too similar to the real data (in terms of statistical and other empirical measures), then an ‘attacker’ (an entity interested in privacy breach) can track the original data back from the synthetic data. This defeats the purpose of synthetic data generation. On the other hand, if the synthetic data is too dissimilar to the original data, then any model built on the synthetic data might produce inconsistent results, reducing the utility of such data. A synthetic data generation model should preserve privacy and utility in an ideal scenario. There has been no objective study that determines how well tabular synthetic data generation models balance privacy and utility measures.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">VAE uses deep learning and probabilistic modeling to generate synthetic data. They have an encoder and a decoder and introduce a probabilistic interpretation of the latent space to account for underlying variability. A reparameterization method is used during sampling, and the training process maximizes the lower bound of evidence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. VAEs have advantages for data augmentation and creating more comprehensive datasets but also have limitations, such as difficulty handling discrete data.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">GANs revolutionized synthetic data generation by providing a robust framework for creating highly realistic and diverse samples. It was proposed by Goodfellow <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> in 2014 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. GANs have two primary components: a generator network that produces artificial samples from random noise inputs during training and a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and generated samples. Once trained, GANs can produce synthetic samples with complex patterns, textures, and structures, making them suitable for various applications like image synthesis, text generation, and data augmentation. GANs have several challenges that make them difficult to train. These include oscillatory loss, uninformative loss, mode collapse, hyperparameter tuning, and vanishing gradients. These problems are common to GANs regardless of domain or architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Addressing these issues is crucial for successful GAN training and high-quality data generation. Since the introduction of GANs, the field has seen significant advancements, including Conditional GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN, Coupled GAN, Auxiliary Classifier GAN, Wasserstein GANs, and more <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.3 </span>Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN)</h3>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In 2019, Xu <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> presented a new method for synthesizing data in tabular format using CTGAN. This method aims to model both continuous and categorical columns effectively. The technique involves a unique normalization approach for continuous features and a strategy to handle imbalances in discrete data. For continuous features, CTGAN employs a three-step process. Initially, it uses a variational Gaussian mixture model to model non-Gaussian and multimodal continuous distributions and estimate the number of modes. Each continuous value is then represented as a one-hot vector indicating the mode and a scalar indicating the value within that mode. Categorical columns, on the other hand, are represented through one-hot encoding. The final representation of a row in the tabular data is obtained by concatenating continuous and categorical columns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenge of imbalanced discrete data, CTGAN introduces a conditional vector, a one-hot-encoded vector representing the selection of a specific value for a categorical column. During training, a column with discrete values is uniformly selected, and a specific value is sampled based on the probability mass function across all possible values. The generator is then fed with this conditional vector and a noise vector, and the loss function is modified to penalize the generator for failing to produce the selected column with the chosen value. The concept of "packing" is introduced to prevent mode collapse in the generator. Training CTGAN involves providing a list of discrete columns; others are treated as continuous data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. According to the results of the experiments, CTGAN outperformed other generative models, including CLBN, PrivBN, MedGAN, VeeGAN, and TableGAN, regarding machine learning efficacy on real datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Imbalanced data classes and skewed distributions are prevalent problems in datasets across different fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. These challenges can hinder effective data analysis, research, and practical applications. To overcome these, researchers have devised an approach to tackle this issue through CTAB-GAN, the extension of CTGAN. This method combines conditional generation and sampling-based training techniques to enhance the representation of all classes, particularly those that are underrepresented, and preprocess variables with long-tailed distributions using a logarithmic transformation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Introducing a "conditional vector" to the generator allows it to adapt its synthesis procedure based on specific conditions, thereby improving the representation of all classes. The logarithmic transformation aids in compressing and reducing the distance between tail and bulk data, facilitating the encoding of all values, including tail ones, by the variational Gaussian mixture. To ensure the quality of synthetic data, researchers have introduced two terms into the generator’s loss function- information loss and classification loss. These terms minimize statistical differences between generated and real data, encourage the generator to match the real dataset’s statistical characteristics, and predict labels for synthetic data instances, ensuring adherence to expected semantic criteria. CTAB-GAN addresses challenges with continuous variables by employing mode-specific normalization, resulting in more accurate synthesis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

However, it is essential to note that GAN-based models, including CTAB-GAN, require a large sample size for training. Therefore, users should consider this aspect when assessing the practical applicability of CTAB-GAN, particularly in scenarios where resource constraints may pose challenges.

This oversight generates inaccuracies such as approximating zero values instead of exact zeros and assigning meaning to negative values where there is no reality. They have utilized sampling and mode-specific normalization methods from CTGAN to deal with imbalanced data and multimodal distribution, respectively. Additionally, to enhance the stability of GAN training, CTAB-GAN+ has incorporated the Wasserstein plus gradient penalty for the loss function, which was developed to address the exploding and vanishing gradient concerns that can arise in the original WGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, to safeguard the privacy of contributors while enabling meaningful aggregate analysis, the encoder part of the model uses differential privacy, which introduces controlled noise into datasets, ensuring that individual data points remain indistinguishable within the statistical analysis. CTAB-GAN+ outperforms other generative models regarding machine utility and statistical similarity, making it an excellent choice for data generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">TabDDPM uses diffusion models, known for generating images, and adjusts them to generate tabular data. These models add noise to the input data through iterative diffusion and then reverse it to produce a synthetic sample close to the original distribution. Recently, Kotelnikov <span id="S2.SS6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> introduced TabDDPM, a state-of-the-art method generative model for handling diverse features in tabular data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. They address differences in feature types by preprocessing continuous features with Gaussian quantile transformation and representing categorical features with one hot encoding. The model uses multinomial diffusion for categorical features and Gaussian diffusion for continuous features. Each categorical feature undergoes a separate diffusion process, where noise components are sampled independently for all features. A multilayer perceptron models the reverse diffusion step, which takes noisy input data and predicts Gaussian and multinomial diffusion outcomes. Training involves minimizing mean squared error for Gaussian diffusion and KL divergence for multinomial diffusion. A class conditional model is used for classification, and regression, the target is treated as an additional numerical feature. TabDDPM performs well on benchmark datasets, consistently generating high-quality synthetic samples compared to existing GAN or VAE-based models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, this model treats categorical features with one-hot encoding, which makes the original data sparse. This might affect the synthetic data generation, especially when the sample size is small. In addition, the TabDDPM model processes the feature types separately, possibly not capturing the relationship between different feature types.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section introduces the NextConvGeN model, designed to generate synthetic clinical tabular data using convex space learning.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">3.1 </span>Overview of NextConvGeN model</h3>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">NextConvGeN model is developed with its underlying principle based on the ConvGeN model. The learning approach of NextConvGeN is based on deep cooperative learning, which involves using two neural networks to learn convex coefficients during the training process. The generator network produces synthetic samples within the convex space of the input data neighborhood, while the discriminator network classifies these samples against the rest of the data space. The networks work together, learning from each other’s feedback and improving their capabilities over multiple iterations. NextConvGeN learns the optimal coefficients for convex combinations during training by adjusting the neural network’s parameters iteratively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike ConvGeN, which takes shuffled batches of minority class data neighborhoods as inputs, NextConvGeN’s generator is designed to receive shuffled neighborhood batches from the entire data space as its inputs. These neighborhoods are identified using a unique nonlinear dimensional reduction approach called Feature-type Distributed Clustering (FDC) introduced by Bej <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. This approach provides a more effective framework for generating informative low-dimensional embedding from high-dimensional tabular data than conventional Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a commonly used nonlinear dimension reduction technique with a choice of similarity measures. FDC applies the UMAP technique independently to each feature type (continuous, ordinal, and nominal) using specific similarity measures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The resulting lower dimension is more meaningful, considering the diverse feature types present in the data. Hence, we explore the neighborhoods based on this lower dimension.</p>

Those synthetic samples are classified against (ii) by the discriminator. By cooperating with the discriminator, the generator learns the appropriate coefficients of convex combinations for synthetic data generation in a way that improves the discriminator’s classification performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Note that the ConvGeN model could only be used in an imbalanced classification where there are well-defined minority and majority classes. Our proposed model does not require any such labels and can be used for general synthetic tabular data generation. Anticipating the primary application of the proposed model in the clinical and biomedical domain, an important change that we incorporated in the novel model is the choice of neighborhoods by incorporating different distance measures for various feature types (continuous, ordinal, and nominal).</p>

To determine the effectiveness of the proposed NextConvGeN model, we compared it against adopting four state-of-the-art approaches as benchmarks: TVAE, CTGAN, CTAB-GAN, CTAB-GAN+, and TabDDPM. We generate synthetic samples five times the size of real training samples from each generative model. Later, we down-sample (to the size of the training data) to maintain the cardinality of the target feature as in the real training data. This down-sampled synthetic data is then used for both utility and privacy evaluation. By downsampling to match the cardinality (number of unique values) of the target feature in the real data, we create a fair comparison where all the models are evaluated on the datasets with the same class distribution as real.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Evaluation measures are crucial in determining the effectiveness and reliability of synthetic data generated to represent real data. However, there are no standard measures for evaluating tabular synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>; hence, we have chosen some commonly used measures from the available sources for benchmarking. To compare the quality of synthetic data generated by several models, we evaluate the synthetic data in terms of Utility and Privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Utility measures for synthetic data are determined by the performance of synthetic data for any given task, such as classification or regression. Fidelity refers to the statistical similarity between real and its corresponding synthetic data. This encompasses aspects like the distribution of features across both datasets. Jordon <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> states that fidelity is often considered alongside utility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In our benchmarking evaluation, we therefore considered Fidelity measures under Utility. In the evaluation context, Privacy is a measure that quantifies the amount of information about the original data revealed by its corresponding synthetic data.

Gradient boosting classifier is employed due to its ability to combine weak models into a powerful learner that effectively handles numerical and categorical features. After training, both the models were tested on the same holdout data, which was not seen by either the classifiers or the generative models during training. This is known as holdout data analysis. The absolute difference in the performance (in terms of the F1-score) was calculated. It is important to note that a five-fold cross-validation was performed before training, and the absolute performance difference between the models is calculated. The smaller the differences, the better the machine learning efficiency of synthetic data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In benchmarking studies, it is often taken into account how well a synthetic data generation model can preserve privacy. However, only a few privacy measures are available. Moreover, there is no well-established standard measure yet to quantify how much synthetic data preserves privacy. In our benchmarking experiments, we used three privacy measures: Distance metrics, Membership Inference Attack (MIA), and Attribute Inference Attack (AIA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
If the synthetic data generated by a generative model is highly similar to the real data, then the average distance between the pairwise data points is expected to be very small. The smaller the distance, the higher the potential for privacy risks. MIA occurs when an attacker tries to determine if a patient record was employed in training a generative model. In contrast, AIA happens when an attacker has access to some attributes or features of the real data and tries to find the values of an unknown patient attribute using synthetic data. In the following, we provide further information on these measures.</p>

The metrics employed include Euclidean distance, Hausdorff distance, and cosine similarity. The pairwise similarity value is calculated for each pair of records between real and synthetic, and the mean values of those pairwise similarity values are analyzed. Euclidean distance captures the difference between two data points by calculating the straight-line distance in a multidimensional space. A smaller Euclidean distance indicates a high risk of privacy breach. Hausdorff distance calculates the maximum pairwise shortest distance between real and synthetic data. A smaller Hausdorff distance is associated with a higher privacy risk. Conversely, cosine similarity measures the directional similarity between data points, reflecting how closely their angles align in the multidimensional space. The higher the value of cosine similarity, the higher the privacy risk.</p>

The attackers will have access to complete synthetic data and quasi-identifiers for some real records. Quasi-identifiers are attributes or features that are not unique identifiers, such as age or gender. A decision tree classifier or regressor is trained on quasi-identifiers of synthetic data to learn the sensitive feature or attribute depending upon the target type <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

The TabDDPM model produces a p-value less than <math id="S5.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.05" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S5.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">0.05</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.3.m3.1b"><cn type="float" id="S5.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.3.m3.1.1">0.05</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.3.m3.1c">0.05</annotation></semantics></math> for only one dataset. Overall, TVAE, CTAB-GAN+, and TabDDPM demonstrate similarities between the synthetic and original continuous features. In the case of NextConvGeN, CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN, we find p-values above the <math id="S5.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.05" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.4.m4.1a"><mn id="S5.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml">0.05</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.4.m4.1b"><cn type="float" id="S5.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.4.m4.1.1">0.05</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.4.m4.1c">0.05</annotation></semantics></math> threshold for six, five, and four datasets, respectively.

<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Categorical features probability distributions across the synthetic and real data were compared using KL divergence, and the findings are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. A KL divergence score of zero signifies that the distributions are identical. In contrast, higher scores indicate that the distributions are different. TabDDPM proves to be the best-performing model, followed by NextConvGeN, generating synthetic data with categorical features probability distributions that are closer to the real data. However, one can observe that there are only small differences in the performances of the TabDDPM and NextConvGeN models, and they are quite comparable in terms of performance. TVAE, CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN models achieved higher KL divergence scores consistently compared to other models, indicating that the categorical probability distributions are not well preserved. On the other hand, CTAB-GAN+ produces a smaller KL divergence score compared to other GAN-based models and TVAE. Overall, the findings show that TabDDPM and NextConvGeN are suitable for generating synthetic categorical variables with similar probability distributions in real data.</p>

Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows the log cluster values for various generative models across ten publicly available data sets. This metric measures how similar the distribution of clusters is across real and synthetic data. A higher magnitude for this measure would indicate a similar distribution of clusters in real and synthetic. As per Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, TabDDPM produces higher log cluster measures for five of the ten benchmarking datasets, which is superior to any other model. This indicates that the synthetic data generated by TabDDPM follows a similar cluster distribution as that of real data. However, the performance of NextConvGeN is comparable to TabDDPM, with the second highest average magnitude of the log-cluster metric. This shows that the distribution of clusters can be better retained in synthetic data by the models TabDDPM and NextConvGeN.</p>

Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> compares the absolute cross-validation difference between the classifiers trained on real and synthetic data. The expected cross-validation difference is smaller when the synthetic data is similar to real data. We observe that out of ten benchmarking datasets, the NextConvGeN and TabDDPM model outperforms other synthetic data generation models for three datasets. The results indicate that even powerful classifiers like gradient boosting perform similarly when trained on synthetic data (generated by NextConvGeN or TabDDPM) and original data separately. On the other hand, the results of TVAE, CTGAN, CTAB-GAN, and CTAB-GAN+ show more considerable differences for most small clinical datasets compared to NextConvGeN and TabDDPM, indicating that these models are more suited for large datasets.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Assessment of predictive consistency of classifiers trained on synthetic data on unseen data:</span> To assess the comparability of classifiers trained on real and synthetic data, we evaluate their ability to perform on unseen real data (holdout data). To accomplish this, we compute the absolute difference in performance on holdout data between the classifiers trained on real and synthetic data, as detailed in Table <a href="#S5.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. As the difference gets closer to zero, it indicates that the classifiers trained on real and synthetic data are similar, as reflected by an equivalent F1 score when tested on holdout data. The results in the table demonstrate that NextConvGeN, TabDDPM, and CTAB-GAN are comparable by slight differences in the three datasets. However, the TVAE, CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ model performs better in two of ten benchmark datasets. It is noteworthy that all models except TVAE show zero absolute difference in the case of lung cancer data. We cannot conclusively say from the results whether a particular synthetic data generation model has an edge over the others.</p>

From the table, we can observe that NextConvGeN has a propensity score close to zero, suggesting that it is challenging for the machine learning classifiers to differentiate between real and NextConvGeN generated synthetic data.

The cross-correlation metric evaluates the statistical dependencies produced for a variable by considering other variables through a classifier.

These distances are calculated between real and its corresponding synthetic data generated by various generative models across ten benchmarking datasets. The generative models underwent five training rounds on real training data with different random seeds, and we averaged the resulting distances for each run to produce fifty values across the ten datasets. These results were then visually represented through box plots showcasing the distributions of Euclidean, Hausdorff, and Cosine similarities (refer to Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). The Euclidean distance (larger the better) box plot indicated that privacy risks were relatively uniform across generative models. However, the Hausdorff distance (larger the better) box plot highlighted lower privacy risks with CTGAN due to greater distances between real and synthetic samples, whereas other models showed smaller Hausdorff distances, indicating potential privacy concerns. On the other hand, CTAB-GAN exhibited minimal cosine similarity (smaller the better), indicating superior privacy protection, while NextConvGeN and TabDDPM had broader distributions with extreme values, suggesting possibly high privacy risks. In conclusion, while there were no significant differences in Euclidean distance performance among models, CTGAN and CTAB-GAN showed lower privacy risks regarding Hausdorff distance and cosine similarity, respectively.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6 </span>Discussion</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We will now discuss some interesting observations that arise from our results. Our result reflects the dilemma of designing a synthetic data generation strategy that preserves privacy and utility. High value for utility measures broadly indicate that the statistical distributions of the real and the synthetic data are similar. Moreover, it also indicates that the performance of machine learning tasks such as clustering or classification is similar across real and synthetic data. If the synthetic data is to be used as an alternative to real data, then high utility is required.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, notice the absolute five-fold cross-validation performance difference between the gradient descent classifier trained on real and synthetic data. For the CTGAN and CTAB-GAN models, the difference is more than ten percent for more than fifty percent of the datasets. There is no objective measure in the literature that comments on the effect of such difference once these synthetic data generation strategies are applied to practical, real-life scenarios. More than a ten percent difference on more than half the datasets intuitively translates to poorly performing models. However, if we focus too much on making the synthetic data similar enough to the real data, we automatically compromise on privacy. Once the data distribution of the synthetic data is too similar to that of the real data, it is easier to track the real data back from the synthetic data (reidentification risk). This is reflected in our results. We observe that TabDDPM and NextConvGeN models perform worse than CTGAN and CTAB-GAN regarding privacy measures. Therefore, our results reflect the utility-privacy dilemma.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Note that GAN-based models fundamentally rely on adversarial learning. Such models fundamentally try to learn a mapping from a random distribution (noise) to the data distribution. The real data is no longer needed for the synthetic sample generation step in such models. A random noise picked from the chosen noise distribution can be converted to a real data point. On the other hand, both TabDDPM and NextConvGeN use the real data points directly for the synthetic data generation. In NextConvGeN, for example, a data neighborhood sampled from a real data neighborhood is passed on to the generator to generate synthetic samples from the convex hull of that data neighborhood. This can be a key driving factor behind the high-utility performance of the TabDDPM and the NextConvGeN models. The poor utility performance of CTGAN, CTAB-GAN, and CTAB-GAN+ can be even more pronounced when the training dataset is smaller. We can expect the GAN models to require more training data, as they are essentially learning to map a completely random distribution to a known data distribution. In real-life scenarios, however, clinical data, particularly generated at a single health facility, is often small in size.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A natural question we can ask here is that which among the privacy and utility measures are more important. Unfortunately, not much research has been conducted to answer such a question. However, common sense suggests that a synthetic data generation model that performs poorly in terms of utility in the first place is of little value. Even though it preserves privacy, the synthetic data does not represent the real data well enough. Therefore, it is unsuitable for any machine learning analysis that is performed to make decisions based on real data. On the other hand, if at least the utility is high, then there are measures for the safe sharing of data in general, which can be used for sharing the synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. In such a case, the high-utility synthetic data can provide an additional level of data security. We would argue that a synthetic data generation model can be judged in terms of privacy, given that it satisfies utility requirements to some degree. We point out the necessity of an objective determination of a proper utility threshold for a synthetic data generation model to be considered for privacy preservation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we would like to highlight the mode collapse problem in TVAE and CTAB-GAN+. Mode collapse occurs when generative models converge on a limited set of outputs, failing to capture the full diversity of the data. Although CTAB-GAN+ is designed with a specific architectural feature to address mode collapse (training by sampling and packing), its performance on small clinical data has not been evaluated. The mode collapse in CTAB-GAN+ might be attributed to the limited training data. With a smaller dataset, the generators may struggle to learn the complex underlying distributions of minority samples, resulting in a preference for majority samples. In TVAE, information compression in the latent space during encoding could hinder the decoder’s ability to reconstruct all target classes. On the other hand, in NextConvGeN, the generators are trained in every minority sample neighborhood and generate samples within each neighborhood. Overall, the evaluation study suggests that TVAE and CTAB-GAN+ may not be optimal if the dataset is small and imbalanced.</p>

<div id="S6.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p6.2" class="ltx_p">There are many generative models that lack some practical aspects, such as the preservation of functional and logical dependencies in synthetic data. Typically, the features in tabular datasets can be logically or functionally dependent. Let us take a crude example to understand this. Say a tabular dataset has two features: BMI (real-valued) and Diabetes (binary-valued). Say the dataset is curated in a health facility that considers a BMI threshold of <math id="S6.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p6.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> for the diagnosis of Diabetes.

There is, therefore, a logical dependency between the two features of BMI and Diabetes. In synthetic data, if there is a data point for this, the BMI is greater than the threshold, but the Diabetes value is negative, then a logical fallacy arises. Notably, such intricate complicates arise in synthetic data generation for the tabular data modality, demanding more research on this topic.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">7 </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed the NextConvGeN model, a deep learning architecture for generating entire tabular data. The model improves on previous convex space learning (ConvGeN) model built for oversampling on imbalanced datasets. However, there are some important additions to our new model’s synthetic data generation process. Firstly, we used an improved approach to identify data neighborhoods. This approach involves separate dimension reduction for each feature type using appropriate distance measures, leading to a more informative lower-dimensional representation of the real data. This allows NextConvGeN to capture non-linear similarities when determining data neighborhoods. Secondly, we added the ‘Alpha clipping,’ a technique to control the variance of the synthetic samples generated in a data neighborhood. It also prevents the synthetic data generated from being too similar to the real data. Thirdly, we adapt the training procedure of NextConvGeN outside the context of imbalanced classification. In contrast to ConvGeN, which receives a minority neighborhood as input to the generator, which is discriminated against a batch of majority class samples, NextConvGeN receives an FDC-assisted data neighborhood, which is discriminated against a random batch drawn from the rest of the data distribution (complement of the FDC-assisted data neighborhood).</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In general, the performances of NextConvGeN are comparable to the TabDDPM model. However, NextConvGeN shows superior performance for utility measures. For classification tasks, we saw that synthetic samples generated by NextConvGeN preserve classification performance for synthetic data compared to real data even better compared to TabDDPM.
After comparing various synthetic data generation approaches, we delve into the critical challenge of balancing utility and privacy, an aspect overlooked in previous research. Finally, in Section <a href="#S6" title="6 Discussion ‣ Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we address the limitations of our approach and explore the broader context of this field. Our work, therefore, can be a valuable addition to the literature on synthetic tabular data generation. The proposed model has the potential for wider applications in utility-focused synthetic data generation and balanced privacy.</p>
