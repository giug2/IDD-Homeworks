<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Latest federated learning (FL) methods started to focus on how to use unlabeled data in clients for training due to users’ privacy concerns, high labeling costs, or lack of expertise. However, current Federated Semi-Supervised/Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) approaches fail to learn large-scale images because of the limited computing resources of local clients. In this paper, we introduce a new framework FedMAE, which stands for Federated Masked AutoEncoder, to address the problem of how to utilize unlabeled large-scale images for FL. Specifically, FedMAE can pre-train one-block Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) using large images in lightweight client devices, and then cascades multiple pre-trained one-block MAEs in the server to build a multi-block ViT backbone for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on image reconstruction and classification show that our FedMAE achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FSSL methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Self-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted extensive research attention for learning representations without costly data labeling. The common practice in computer vision is to design proxy tasks to allow visual representation learning from unlabeled images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The current state-of-the-art SSL methods integrate contrastive learning with Siamese networks to increase the similarity between two augmented versions of images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, or use autoencoder to reconstruct the input images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, while all these solutions assume training images are centrally available in cloud servers.
In the real world, however, decentralized image data are exploding in growth, and data collected by different parties may not be centralized due to data privacy regulations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing approaches cannot well use decentralized unlabeled data to learn a generic representation while preserving data privacy. Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>is an emerging distributed training technique in which several clients collectively train a global model through coordinated communication.
However, traditional federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> relies on data labels, while this assumption may be excessive as labeling data is expensive, time-consuming, and indispensable to the participation of domain experts. Decentralized data is normally unlabeled, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which are critical challenges for learning from multiple clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Motivated by these practical scenarios, many SSL methods are used in federated learning, such as FedU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, FedEMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and Orchestra <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Due to the limited computation resource of client devices, these approaches use small models, e.g., ResNet18, to train small images. The state-of-the-art methods have not revealed how lightweight clients learn unlabeled large-scale images effectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancement of Transformers has great achievements in computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, the biggest problem with applying Transformers in federated learning is a large weight, which is difficult to deploy on small computing devices for training large images. In this paper, we propose a simple, effective, and scalable framework, FedMAE, which stands for Federated Masked AutoEncoder. Our FedMAE only deploys the MAE with a one-block encoder and a one-block decoder as our pre-training model on the local clients and masks the random patches in the input image and then reconstructs the missing patches in the pixel space. Although the one-block model learns limited information and performs poorly in downstream tasks, we found that cascading many pre-trained one-block MAEs together (without weights aggregation in traditional FL) can achieve stunning performance in downstream tasks. With this design, FedMAE can achieve a win-win scenario, i.e., it improves model accuracy by training large images on lightweight client devices and allowing more distributed or mobile clients to participate in training asynchronously. To get a qualitative sense of our FedMAE performance, see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3rd item ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedMAE: Federated Self-Supervised Learning with One-Block Masked Auto-Encoder" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which compares the reconstruction effect of the un-pretrained five-block MAE and the five-block MAE pre-trained by FedMAE.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Self-Supervised Learning is a recent paradigm in unsupervised representation learning, especially discriminative SSL, which exploits the invariance of different views after data augmentation, making the representations of positive pairs similar while pushing negative pairs away. In order to obtain sufficient informative negative examples in contrastive learning, the methods usually rely on large memory banks such as Moco <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, or large batch size such as SimCLR<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.

RSCFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> relies on clients with labeled data to assist in learning unlabeled data in other clients.

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A masked autoencoder is a simple autoencoding method that reconstructs the original signal given its partial observation. To enable more local clients to participate in training, FedMAE’s pre-training model contains only one block of encoder and decoder, allowing many devices with insufficient computing power, e.g., mobile phones and Internet of Things devices, to participate in training on large images. Like all autoencoders, our one-block encoder maps the observed signal to a latent representation, and the one-block decoder reconstructs the original signal from the latent representation when pre-training. For the downstream model of FedMAE, we adopt a cascade design that allows multiple pre-trained one-block MAE connected in sequence to build a ViT model with multi-blocks for downstream training. Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.2 Federated Semi-Supervised/Self-Supervised Learning ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ FedMAE: Federated Self-Supervised Learning with One-Block Masked Auto-Encoder" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrates the idea, introduced next.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FedMAE, we build a tiny MAE with a one-block encoder and a one-block decoder as the pre-trained model for client devices. Our encoder is a ViT but applied only on visible, unmasked patches. Similar to a traditional ViT, our encoder embeds patches using a linear projection with additional positional embeddings and then processes the resultant set using a single Transformer block. Just as in a standard MAE, our encoder only performs on a small subset (e.g., 25%) of the whole set. Masked patches are removed, and no mask tokens are used for our encoder. The whole set is handled by a lightweight one-block decoder. The pre-trained model only has one Transformer block, which is used to predict masked patches for reconstructing original images.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">3.2 </span>Downstream Model</h3>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Without a doubt, the pre-trained model has a certain ability to filter interference that masks features because of the loss of explicit information. Therefore, when the pre-trained model is transferred to the downstream ViT classifier, its performance is significantly improved compared to the un-pretrained ViT, which can only obtain classification knowledge through label training and cannot mine implicit features. Moreover, the input and output of each block from the Transformer are in the same dimension, and each block in the multi-block ViT is learning how to extract feature representations. They have the same or similar learning capabilities, although there are some differences in extracting features. Due to the similarity of learning purposes for each block, FedMAE tries to cascade multiple one-block pre-trained MAEs, which will achieve higher-order implicit feature representations based on multi-block mapping to help boost and speed up the downstream task training.</p>

We use unmasked patches (25% of the whole image) for encoding, which means the model is tiny that is easy to deploy in many lightweight clients and train large images.
② shows the communication between clients and the server. Due to the special one-block structure of the pre-training model and the very small learning rate of Transformer, the average operation of multiple model weights is not necessary (or effective) to boost the accuracy. Therefore, FedMAE realises pure asynchronous training, i.e., multiple pre-training models can train on different clients asynchronously without relying on each other. ③ shows cascading multiple pre-trained one-block MAEs to form a multi-block model to help train the downstream task, e.g., both the encoder and decoder are needed to perform the image reconstruction task, and only the encoder is used to produce image representations for recognition.</p>

It can be seen that the original data are augmented with features interfering with corruption processing to form diverse variations. This strategy can improve the sample diversity as an augmentation on the one hand and reduce the variance on the other hand so that the system can learn the impact of feature interference on the data caused by multiple explicit information loss.</p>

In this paper, we mainly focus on the nature of the mapping and therefore use this mapping to simplify the problem, with the main aim of discussing the relationship between the sample, the loss function, and the optimal reconstruction in federated learning.</span></p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Datasets</span>
We conduct our experiments using several datasets. We use ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> with 1000 classes and Mini-ImageNet with 100 classes, and both of their input size is 224x224. The total number of mini-ImageNet is 60000, which are chosen from ImageNet by the method of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, while the ImageNet has 1,281,167 training images and 50000 test images.
We also use other public datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and Mini-INAT2021.
There are 60,000 32x32 color images in CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, where the training set has 50,000 images, and the test set has 10,000 images. CIFAR10 is used for the task of 10-class image classification, while CIFAR100 is utilized for the 100-class image classification task.
On the other hand, Mini-INAT2021 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is also a large-scale dataset, which is the more accessible version of INaturalist Dataset 2021. Compared to the original dataset which contains nearly 2.7M training images for 10000 natural species, the number of images in Mini-INAT2021 has been cut down to 50 training samples and 10 validation samples per specie for a total of 500K training images and 100K validation images. The maximum dimension of these images is 800 pixels.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Setup</span>
Our experiments consist of two phases: federated pre-training and downstream fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase, we use the Mini-ImageNet dataset if our results need to be compared with the results of other baselines. Otherwise, we use the ImageNet dataset to evaluate the effect of various parameters on the performance of our method.
The pre-training dataset is divided into K clients. When the data held by each client is assumed to be IID distributed among each other, the division of the dataset requires that each client holds images of all categories. When the data division is assumed to follow non-IID distribution, we divide the dataset by taking a sample of the Dirichet distribution’s class priors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. More heterogeneous division can be made by specifying smaller Dirichet parameter <math id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> during sampling.
Unless otherwise stated, the federated learning conducted in the pre-training phase adopts the following settings. The number of training rounds is set to 200, the number of local epochs is set to 10, the total number of local clients is set to 100, and the participation ratio is set to 0.05. In the downstream fine-tuning phase, we replace the decoder part of the pre-trained backbone with the head layer specified by the downstream task and retrain the weights and biases of all layers. For all downstream tasks, the model is trained for 100 epochs at a batch size of 64. In addition, for the supervised evaluation, we fine-tuned the new model using 100% of the labeled data. For the semi-supervised evaluation, we use 10% of the labeled data for fine-tuning. Since the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets are relatively simple, we only test supervised evaluation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first assess the accuracies, model parameters and GFLOPs of different FSSL methods using fine-tune protocol and transfer learning evaluation.
In this experiment, we examine FedMAE’s performance in IID and Non-IID scenarios since cross-device FL is our key purpose for developing FedMAE. The pre-training dataset used in FL is Mini-ImageNet, and the downstream tasks’ datasets are CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Mini-INAT and ImageNet.
Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedMAE: Federated Self-Supervised Learning with One-Block Masked Auto-Encoder" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows our FedMAE can achieve state-of-the-art results on small image datasets such as CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Meanwhile, FedMAE demonstrates exceptional performance on large image datasets, such as Mini-INAT and ImageNet, surpassing other FSSL techniques in both IID and non-IID scenarios in terms of accuracy. Specifically, in the IID environment with 100% labeled data, FedMAE achieves an accuracy of 46.01% on Mini-INAT, which is 7.27% higher than the accuracy obtained by other methods. In the non-IID scenario with 100% labeled data, FedMAE achieves an accuracy of 77.79% on ImageNet, which is 11.29% higher than the accuracy obtained by other methods.

The pre-training model of FedMAE is not only the smallest in parameters but also the smallest in GFLOPs, which means faster transmission between local clients and the server, and fewer computing power requirements for local clients. Although the downstream model of FedMAE has a large number of parameters due to the cascade design, the computation resources required for its training and subsequent inference are acceptable among all models at present, which can be deployed for inference in local clients.</p>

The data distribution in federated learning is dispersed and most current FSSL methods are based on contrastive learning, so SSL approaches tend to be sensitive to heterogeneity and therefore adopt certain strategies for this challenge. In contrast, FedMAE is robust and its performance generally does not degrade with increasing heterogeneity. In fact, the pre-trained model of FedMAE is an image reconstruction method that uses an autoencoder, which is not sensitive to image classification, FedMAE learns how to reconstruct the image itself rather than the class features of images in the period of pre-training.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since what one-block MAE can learn is very limited, we share a small amount of data on the server to help build a better downstream model. We tested the accuracies of downstream datasets when sharing 0, 1000, 5000 and 10000 unlabeled data on the server. In this scenario, we first use clients’ data for federated training, after 200 training rounds, we cascade 5 one-block pre-trained MAE to build a five-block MAE. Afterward, sharing data on the server will be fed into the five-block MAE to train a better downstream model for downstream tasks. The training epochs here for sharing data are 100. Results are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.4 Number of Clients. ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedMAE: Federated Self-Supervised Learning with One-Block Masked Auto-Encoder" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.

<p id="S5.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The participation ratio indicates the number of clients connecting to the server in each training round. In this experiment, our method follows the aggregation strategy of other FSSL methods to average the client models trained in each round, while Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 5.6 Local Epochs ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedMAE: Federated Self-Supervised Learning with One-Block Masked Auto-Encoder" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows that simply increasing this federated learning attribute does not produce a boost in fine-tuning accuracy as in other FSSL methods which uses CNN architecture. The reason why this attribute has no effect to the results is that the pre-train model is very short which only has one block autoencoder, and the learning rate is very small. If we increase the depth of the pre-trained backbone and the participation ratio, the fine-tuning accuracy may also be improved.</p>

<p id="S5.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to Table <a href="#S5.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 5.7 Participation Ratio ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedMAE: Federated Self-Supervised Learning with One-Block Masked Auto-Encoder" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, the fine-tuning accuracy for the downstream tasks increases as the number of training rounds increases in pre-training. This increase trend is more pronounced in the first 1200 rounds, while eases off in the later rounds. Therefore, for our method FedMAE, we consider a good Nash equilibrium between training cost and fine-tuning accuracy is 1200 training rounds.</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We further conducted additional experiments on the depth of the downstream model. Since the pre-trained model is an MAE with only one block, and its learning ability to extract features is very limited, so we want to know whether the pre-trained one-block encoder has a positive effect on the deeper blocks of a multi-block encoder. Therefore, we cascade different numbers of pre-trained models to compare with models of the same depth but without pre-training. The results are shown in Table <a href="#S5.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 5.8 Number of Training Rounds ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ FedMAE: Federated Self-Supervised Learning with One-Block Masked Auto-Encoder" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, which indicate that the pre-trained model still has a great influence on the overall downstream model as the depth increases. Although the increase in model depth would have improved the learning ability of the model, the result is obvious that the one-block pre-trained model improves the learning ability of each block of the downstream model with multi-blocks.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The results of the previous ablation study show that the fine-tuning accuracy is influenced by the depth of the downstream model, and our method FedMAE still has an effect on the downstream model as the depth increases. Based on this finding, we continue to test whether changing the number of pre-trained blocks in the downstream model could also affect the fine-tuning accuracy for downstream tasks. The model depth in this session is from one to five. The experimental results in Table <a href="#S6.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 6.1 Model Depth in Downstream Model ‣ 6 Ablation Study ‣ FedMAE: Federated Self-Supervised Learning with One-Block Masked Auto-Encoder" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> demonstrate that every pre-trained Transformer block in the cascaded encoder contributes to the improvement of fine-tuning accuracy. As the depth of the model increases, the more pre-trained blocks are cascaded in downstream models, the higher fine-tuning accuracy the downstream model has.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce a novel framework FedMAE, addressing the training of large-scale distributed unlabeled datasets in federated learning. Our pre-training model only contains a one-block encoder and a one-block decoder and uses a masking strategy for training data, so it is easy to deploy in various lightweight clients. Pre-training models in FL can be trained on different clients asynchronously without average aggregation. Pre-trained models are cascaded in the server to build a multi-block downstream model. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on image reconstruction and classification show that our FedMAE achieves a considerable boost compared to previous FSSL methods.</p>
