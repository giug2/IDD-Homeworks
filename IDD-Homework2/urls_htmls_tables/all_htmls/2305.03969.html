in which densely distributed edge devices periodically exchange model-updates with the server to complete the global model training.
Due to limited bandwidth and uncertain wireless environment, FEEL may impose heavy burden to the current communication system.
In addition, under the common FEEL framework, the server needs to wait for the slowest device to complete the update uploading before starting the aggregation process,
leading to the straggler issue that causes prolonged communication time.
In this paper, we propose to accelerate FEEL from two aspects: i.e., 1) performing data compression on the edge devices and 2) setting a deadline on the edge server to exclude the straggler devices.
However, undesired gradient compression errors and transmission outage are introduced by the aforementioned operations respectively, affecting the convergence of FEEL as well.
In view of these practical issues, we formulate a training time minimization problem, with the compression ratio and deadline to be optimized.
To this end,
an asymptotically unbiased aggregation scheme is first proposed to ensure zero optimality gap after convergence,
and the impact of compression error and transmission outage on the overall training time are quantified through convergence analysis.
Then, the formulated problem is solved in an alternating manner, based on which, the novel <em id="id6.id1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">joint compression and deadline optimization</em> (JCDO) algorithm is derived.
Numerical experiments
for different use cases in FEEL including image classification and autonomous driving
show that the proposed method is nearly 30X faster than the vanilla FedSGD algorithm, and outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated edge learning</em> (FEEL) is a popular distributed learning framework for tackling the privacy-preserving training issues at the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
By distributing the computations across edge devices, the edge server only needs to collect the local updates instead of the original private data.
Through frequent model interaction, the rich data widely distributed at edge devices can be fully utilized for training without compromising their privacy.
Nevertheless, the improvement of model performance in deep learning is usually accompanied with a significant increase in model size.
As the edge devices need to upload the computed learning updates (e.g., local gradients or models) to the edge server at each round, the data transmission brings a huge overload to the current wireless communication system, causing transmission jam or unbearable delay.
This thus prompts an active research area focusing on developing communication-efficient techniques to deploy FEEL over wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To alleviate the communication bottleneck, a common and intuitive approach is to compress the local updates to be uploaded via lossy compression techniques, e.g., quantization and sparsification.
By quantization, the compression is achieved through representing each element with less bits. A lot of quantization schemes had been developed for the distributed learning settings, e.g., SignSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, TernSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, QSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, etc.
By sparsification, the insignificant elements will be dropped, such that the compression can be achieved by only encoding the non-zero elements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
The work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> first considered the compression issue under the federated learning setting, where random mask, subsampling, and probabilistic quantization were proposed to reduce the uplink communication costs.
Realizing the vector features of the local update, the universal vector based rather than element based quantization scheme was proposed to further reduce the communication overhead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Based on quantization and sparsification, update compression had been achieved from the perspective of compressive sensing as well <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
With the aforementioned schemes, the transmission overhead could be reduced effectively.
In the meantime, gradient compression error will be introduced <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
For conducting compression in practical FEEL scenario, in addition to designing compression algorithm, one should also consider setting the compression ratio to efficiently utilize the communication resources.

Aware of the trade-off between the compression ratio and compression error, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed an adaptive quantization strategy, which starts with
a more aggressive quantization scheme and gradually increases its precision
as training progresses.
A similar “latter is better” principle was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Besides, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> proposed a fairness-aware sparcification method, which holds an equal number of non zero elements among the updates from different devices.
Nevertheless, the aforementioned methods focus on dynamic compression ratio over different training stages,
while the unstable wireless environment, representing the communication ability, is neglected.
Given this, it is desired to design the setting method for the purpose of combating against dynamic wireless channel and accelerating FEEL convergence.

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to performing data compression on the device side, some efforts can be made on the server side as well to tackle the communication bottleneck.
In a typical FEEL system, the upload communication time depends on the slowest device.
Due to the heterogeneity of computation and communication resources among devices, some devices with poor channel state or computational capacity may upload their updates much slower than the others, critically prolonging the per-round latency.
This is the well-known “straggler” problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.

Given this, FEEL are extended to the asynchronous setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, which enables devices to upload their updates periodically without strict synchronization.
However, the asynchrony usually results in divergent training, since the updates are obtained based on different global model and devices that can upload quickly tend to upload more frequently than those devices with slow upload speed.
Another alternative method for tackling straggler issue is device scheduling, which is applicable for synchronous FEEL.
It suggests that the edge server should carefully choose the non-straggler devices to upload their model updates.
On this basis,
a device scheduling scheme was initially proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> to mitigate the straggler problem and sample devices based on their resource conditions.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> further proposed to start the federated learning process with the faster devices and gradually involve the stragglers to improve the model performance.
In addition to active device sampling, a more practical and simpler way is to set a deadline for the uploading process to exclude the straggler devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
The edge server will start the aggregation process after the deadline, the updates from the straggler devices are thus dropped.

The deadline can exclude the straggler devices effectively.
However, due to the unreliability of wireless environment,
even non-straggler devices may fail to deliver the local updates,
causing undesired
transmission outages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> that hinder the convergence of the global model, especially in the non independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data distribution settings.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> jointly considered the impacts of data compression and transmission outage for compression ratio design,
and proposed to set the compression ratio to ensure equal outage probability across devices.
However, the deadline in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> is fixed and needs to be preset.
Given the transmission outage brought by the deadline,
it is desired to carefully set the deadline for achieving communication-efficient and FEEL with fast convergence.
<span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Furthermore, the likelihood of transmission outage is also affected by the amount of data being uploaded that depends on the compression ratio.
The collective influence on transmission outage probability arises a strong coupling between compression mechanism and the transmission deadline.<span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
However,
owing to the difficulty in quantifying the impacts of compression and deadline, prior works, to the best of our knowledge, focused on separate design (of either the deadline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> or the compression ratio <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>), or joint design with heuristic approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
<span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Unlike conventional hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate), the optimal values of compression ratio and deadline vary significantly across different learning tasks, wireless environments, and even training stages. Additionally, these parameters are interdependent, making manual tuning highly suboptimal and often leading to substantial performance degradation.
Therefore, the joint design with theoretical guarantee remains a critical issue and warrants immediate attention.<span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
To close this research gap, we make the first attempt to formulate the joint design problem and solve it directly.</span></span></span></span></p>

The online optimization strategy is adopted to avoid non-causal information acquisition.
We solve the resulting problem in an alternating manner, i.e., optimizing one variable by considering the other to be given in each iteration. For the sub-problem of compression ratio optimization, the quasi closed-form solution is derived for efficient calculation; For the sub-problem of deadline optimization, the optimal deadline can be obtained by bisection search efficiently, and it is found that the optimal deadline can adapt to the training stage and channel state through the dynamic change of a weight parameter.

One comes from stochastic compression, and the other is due to the failure in transmission within the required deadline.
In the following, we will analyze the two parts of randomness separately, in terms of compressed gradient error and its success transmission probability, which motivate the design of unbiased aggregation.

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As introduced in Section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3 Compression Model ‣ 2 System Models ‣ Joint Compression and Deadline Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>, the proposed compression includes two stages, e.g., sparsification and encoding.
We consider error only incurred by sparsification, while the encoding is error-free <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
The following lemma provides the statistical properties for the stochastic sparsification, which performs as a surrogate for the compression error.

Specifically, the choice of compression mechanism affects the actual uploading time, while the transmission deadline sets the permissible time window. It is important to note that optimizing one aspect without considering the other would not lead to optimal control over transmission outage. This highlights the strong coupling between compression and deadline and emphasizes the necessity of a joint optimization strategy.</em><span id="Thmremark1.p1.4.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"></span></p>

This indicates that when the transmission conditions is good (i.e., enough deadline or larger transmission rate), the optimal sparser will reserve more elements so as to reduce compression error. On the other hand, when conditions become worse, the sparser will turns its priority to suppress transmission outage by dropping more elements.</em><span id="Thmremark3.p1.10.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"></span></p>

The edge server needs to set the deadline according to the current global model and the channel state.
Intuitively, reducing the deadline can reduce the training latency of each round.
However, for the device side, it will increase the compression error w.r.t. the original local update, as devices have to increase the data compression degree to avoid to increase the outage probability.
According to Remark <a href="#Thmremark2" title="Remark 2. ‣ 3.2 Convergence Analysis ‣ 3 Unbiased Aggregation and Convergence Analysis ‣ Joint Compression and Deadline Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, a larger compression error requires more rounds, thus a smaller deadline does not necessarily lead to less training time.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed JCDO algorithm.
To this end, we consider the following benchmark schemes:
1) FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which uploads the model updates in full precision and waits for the arrive of the slowest device update before starting aggregation process;
2) FedTOE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, which aims to adjust the compression ratio to keep the devices having the same outage probability.
In addition, to verify the effectiveness of compressor and deadline optimization separately, two algorithms extended from JCDO algorithm, namely <em id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">compression-optimization</em> (CO) with a fixed deadline, and <em id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">deadline optimization</em> (DO) with a fixed sparse coefficient are considered as well.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">We consider two federated learning tasks, namely standard task and practical task.
For standard tasks, we consider image classification on FEMNIST dataset and CIFAR10 dataset, using Logistic regression model and VGG model, respectively.
Additionally, we aim to test on real-world advanced FEEL applications, which often involve more complex tasks than classification. Therefore to bridge this gap, we’ve included object detection tasks in autonomous driving applications.<span id="S5.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
Specifically, we consider training the well known YOLOV5 model on a realistic autonomous driving dataset, KITTI.
The training details and the characterization of datasets are presented in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table I ‣ 4.2.2 Deadline Optimization ‣ 4.2 Compression Ratio and Deadline Optimization ‣ 4 Joint Compression and Deadline Optimization ‣ Joint Compression and Deadline Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.
The number of device, communication settings, and computation parameters for the aforementioned tasks are concluded in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table II ‣ 4.2.2 Deadline Optimization ‣ 4.2 Compression Ratio and Deadline Optimization ‣ 4 Joint Compression and Deadline Optimization ‣ Joint Compression and Deadline Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.</span></span></p>

<p id="S5.p3.11" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.p3.11.11" class="ltx_text">Notably, in practical FEEL scenarios, there are many aspects of heterogeneity among devices.
Given this, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, we in this paper consider the heterogeneity issue from three aspects, namely dataset heterogeneity, computation heterogeneity, and communication heterogeneity:
1) Dataset heterogeneity: We use a label aware approach to partition the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Specifically, the whole CIFAR10 dataset is first sorted by the labels, then is divided into <math id="S5.p3.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="40" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p3.1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S5.p3.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p3.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">40</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p3.1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.p3.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p3.1.1.m1.1.1">40</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p3.1.1.m1.1c">40</annotation></semantics></math> shards of size <math id="S5.p3.2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1250" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p3.2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S5.p3.2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p3.2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">1250</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p3.2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.p3.2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p3.2.2.m2.1.1">1250</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p3.2.2.m2.1c">1250</annotation></semantics></math>.
Each device is assigned with 4 shards.
The FEMNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset for federated learning, it is generated from multiple users, thus does not need to be processed manually.
As for the KITTI dataset, we partitioned the dataset in a random manner, that is, each device is randomly assigned <math id="S5.p3.3.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="700" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p3.3.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S5.p3.3.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.p3.3.3.m3.1.1.cmml">700</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p3.3.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.p3.3.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p3.3.3.m3.1.1">700</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p3.3.3.m3.1c">700</annotation></semantics></math> training samples from the whole dataset without replacement.

Through extensive ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of both the compression and deadline optimization strategies, as well as their synergistic effects when jointly optimized. Thus, our joint optimization framework, JCDO, provides a compelling solution for improving the training efficiency in FEEL.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we compare the proposed JCDO algorithm with the benchmark schemes
given different bandwidth and number of devices.
Under a given training objective (i.e., the test accuracy achieves 0.5), the required communication time is depicted in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.1.3 Evaluation on Resources ‣ 5.1 FEEL for Standard Tasks: Classification on FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 Datasets ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Joint Compression and Deadline Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
It can be found that system bandwidth has a huge impact on the required training time.
More specifically, the proposed CO method outperforms FedTOE since CO minimizes the aggregation error introduced by data compression and transmission outage.
Moreover, the DO method that optimizes the per-round deadline outperforms FedTOE and has a comparable performance with CO, which illustrates the importance and necessity of deadline setting.
Finally, the proposed JCDO scheme attains the fastest convergence in all the examined bandwidth settings, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The performance comparison given various number of devices is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.1.3 Evaluation on Resources ‣ 5.1 FEEL for Standard Tasks: Classification on FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 Datasets ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Joint Compression and Deadline Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, where all the schemes have the same training time budget (i.e., 100ms).
After training, we evaluate the global model obtained through different schemes. When number of devices is small (i.e., 10), the randomness caused by transmission outage is large and more likely to result in biased aggregation, which eventually renders performance degradation.
As the number of devices increases, the performance of the scheme based on data compression and deadline setting gradually improves.
Compared to FedTOE, the two baseline algorithms, i.e., CO and DO, demonstrate some performance gain, and the proposed JCDO algorithm outperforms CO and DO, which further validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Firstly, it can be seen that the original FedSGD algorithm requires an extremely long time to complete the learning task.
This is because the FEEL requires a time-consuming data exchange during each update round.

which results in prohibitive communication overhead for bandwidth limited communication system.
In addition, due to the instability of the wireless environment, some straggler devices further prolong the per-round latency.
It reminds us that data compression and deadline design are necessary for the practical deployment of FEEL.
Secondly, the total training time of the other three schemes based on data compression is significantly shortened, all of them can complete the task in <math id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="9000" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1a"><mn id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">9000</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1.1">9000</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.4.m4.1c">9000</annotation></semantics></math>s.
Finally, the proposed JCDO scheme still outperforms CO and FedTOE, as it gives better guidance for the setting of sparse ratio and deadline based on theoretical analysis.
It can be found that the proposed JCDO scheme achieves a speed-up of 30 times compared to the vanilla FedSGD algorithm.
The robustness of the proposed scheme for tackling a variety of learning tasks is verified.</p>

At the later training stage (i.e., with a sufficient long training time), all the schemes have good detection performance.
We can conclude now that the proposed JCDO scheme is most communication-efficient among these schemes.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a communication-efficient FEEL algorithm called JCDO, which alleviates the communication burden through local update compression and deadline for the uploading process.
The compression ratio and the deadline are designed for remaining training time minimization, and obtained through alternating iterative optimization.
Experiments show that the proposed scheme can greatly accelerate FEEL,
and outperform the existing schemes.
Future works will focus on the extensions to the scenarios of model averaging and the aggregation weights optimization.
