<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Self-supervised learning in federated learning paradigm has been gaining a lot of interest both in industry and research due to the collaborative learning capability on unlabeled yet isolated data. However, self-supervised based federated learning strategies suffer from performance degradation due to label scarcity and diverse data distributions, i.e., data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the SelfFed framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Our proposed SelfFed framework works in two phases. The first phase is the pre-training paradigm that performs augmentive modeling using Swin Transformer based encoder in a decentralized manner. The first phase of SelfFed framework helps to overcome the data heterogeneity issue. The second phase is the fine-tuning paradigm that introduces contrastive network and a novel aggregation strategy that is trained on limited labeled data for a target task in a decentralized manner. This fine-tuning stage overcomes the label scarcity problem. We perform our experimental analysis on publicly available medical imaging datasets and show that our proposed SelfFed framework performs better when compared to existing baselines concerning non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data and label scarcity. Our method achieves a maximum improvement of 8.8% and 4.1% on Retina and COVID-FL datasets on non-IID dataset. Further, our proposed method outperforms existing baselines even when trained on a few (10%) labeled instances.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has been an active and challenging area of research for over a decade to the researchers associated with machine learning. IoMT comprises of various tasks including segmentation, classification, and disease detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Standard machine learning algorithms, when applied to analyze data generated by IoMT, are successful in improving the performance of aforementioned tasks. However, these methods face challenges that cannot be tackled when only traditional methods are used. Among these, one of the challenges is data privacy, as the patients data was shared to train a machine learning algorithm that not only risks data leakage but is also vulnerable to data manipulation, resulting in wrong diagnosis. Another challenge corresponds to the learning of IoMT data in a distributed manner. With heterogeneous sensing devices and wearable sensors, the IoMT data is rarely stored to a centralized server, therefore, data from different servers placed at different hospitals need to be trained in a distributed manner. Further, in real-scenarios, it is highly probable that the data from different servers and hospitals follow different distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In this regard, a decentralized learning paradigm is needed to train the data on client devices in order to ensure privacy and tackling heterogeneity in data distribution. The data privacy and varying data distribution issues have been addressed by a seminal work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which proposed using federated learning (FL) paradigm. In FL, each client would train individual models locally at the client side, followed by an aggregation of client models at the server side to construct a global model. The copies of the global model are then sent back to the client for improved inference.
<br class="ltx_break">In recent years, FL has seen drastic growth due to its characteristics that breaks regulatory restrictions, reduces data migration costs, and strengthens data privacy. The FL technique is characterized as distributed machine learning technique and has been widely adopted for applications in the domain of data mining, natural language processing, and computer vision. Although, FL implementations can deal with the data heterogeneity, which is one of the challenges that resists the realization of wider adoption of FL methods. Data heterogeneity issue gets more challenging due to the generation of diversified datasets with varying distributions at client side (due to heterogeneous sensing devices) and behavioral preferences that result in skewed distribution of labels (some sensors have could use heart rate, while others use heart rate variability or blood volume pulse in their daily life). Another challenge associated with FL approach is label scarcity and has been explored relatively lesser in the available literature. This issue could get severe in edge device setting, as the users do not have a user-friendly interface to annotate their data on their IoT or smartphone device. Further, in some cases, users are resistant to annotate the sensitive and private data due to privacy concerns. This is one of the probable reasons as to why large-scale labeled IoMT datasets are scarce in availability.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Researhers have worked extensively on the mitigation of data heterogeneity issue by proposing the training of a global model such as FedOPT, FedNOVA, FedProx, and FedAvg. Researchers have also proposed distributed and personalized FL frameworks to deal with the issue of data heterogeneity in the form of DBFL, Per-FedAvg, Ditto, and pFedMe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, the aforementioned methods work under the assumption that sufficient labels are available at the edge, which is not true in real-life scenarios, especially in the case of IoMT. An Example of label scarcity and data heterogeneity in IoMT are shown in Figure 1. For instance, some hospitals have more data concerning the severe conditions of the patients while others have more data related to the normal conditions of the patients. This phenomenon is referred to as label distribution skew or data partitions with non-identical distribution (non-IID). Another problem highlighted in Figure 1 is related to quantity skew as some hospitals have large amount of data while others have smaller number of images. Similarly, each of the client hospital might use different patient population, acquisition protocols, and devices, which results in feature distribution skew. Label Scarcity is also one of the challenges represented in Figure 1 as some hospitals have large number of annotated data while others might lack in expertise for annotating the data or small proportion of labeled data, respectively. 
<br class="ltx_break">Recently, researchers proposed to tackle the label scarcity issue in FL through semi-supervised methods by assuming that either client or server possess few labeled instances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The semi-supervised methods are based on pseudo-labeling and consistency loss for training a global model. Researchers also tried using unsupervised learning using Siamese network but the method was not able to handle data heterogeneity issue quite well. Furthermore, unsupervised learning in FL was also limited in terms of scalability concerning IoMT devices. Researchers have starting exploring the self-supervised learning strategies such as SimSiam <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, BYOL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, SwAV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and SimCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to tackle the problem of label scarcity but the problem of data heterogeneity still remains at large.
<br class="ltx_break">Extensive research efforts have been carried out to solve skewed data distribution problem that is caused due to the data heterogeneity. A recent study suggested that the family of vision transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> can reduce the issue of data heterogeneity to a certain extent in comparison to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> showed that adopting vision transformers can improve the overall performance in FL methods. Although the statement holds true on general computer vision applications that rely on supervised pre-training from ImageNet but the same cannot be adopted to IoMT data due to domain discrepancy. Therefore, the method that can handle data heterogeneity and label scarcity by leveraging small-scale labeled instances at client side and large-scale unlabeled data at the server side to learn global model in collaborative manner is needed.
<br class="ltx_break">In this paper, we address the label scarcity and data heterogeneity issue by proposing self-supervised federated learning (SelfFed) using online learning principles. The framework employs two phases, i.e. SelfFed pre-training phase and SelfFed Fine-tuning phase. Studies have proved that pre-training pertaining to self-supervised learning is an effective strategy to deal with inductive bias and skewness in label distribution. The visual features learnt from unlabeled data on the client side are leveraged to update the online network encoder at the server side. A contrastive network using consistency loss is trained on the server side, which shares the encoder weights and model parameters with the client side for stage 2 proceedings. The client side model in stage 2 is connected with a linear classifier, which is then trained in a supervised manner. The encoder parameters updated via cross-entropy loss are then shared with online network encoder for further aggregation. Unlike the existing works we use a target network and projection heads to extract high-quality representations. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, self-supervised learning has gained a lot of attention due to its capability of utilizing pretext task information for extracting better features and representations that can be leveraged as supervised information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is important to come up with a relevant pretext task that might vary with respect to different domains including graph, computer vision, natural language processing, and so forth. Generally, self-supervised techniques are categorized into contrastive-based, temporal-based, and context-based methods. The temporal-based methods model the temporal characteristics of the data such as next sentence prediction in natural language processing through BERT, or next action to be carried out in a video while computing the frame similarity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The sequential property in temporal-based self-supervised learning is also referred to as order-based constraint. Another technique utilizes contextual information such as frequency of words or similar words that define the same thing through Word2Vec for the task construction. This technique is termed as context-based self-supervised learning. Many researchers have used contextual information such as image coloring, rotation prediction, jigsaw, and other representations, for the tasks in computer vision field. However, contrastive learning is the most popular technique to be used with self-supervised learning.
<br class="ltx_break">Contrastive learning takes into account the feature space to distignuish between the data rather than considering the monotonous details of instances. This helps the contrastive learning to generate a model that is more generalizable and simpler, respectively. Contrastive learning uses InfoNCE loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to learn discriminating features among constrasting instances while identifying supportive features for identical instances. The simplicity and generalizable of the model can be achieved as the contrastive learning is able to distiniguish or identify similarity in instances at abstract semantic level, i.e. feature spaces. One of the ways to improve the performance of contrastive learning is to expand upon the number of negative samples. One of the seminal studies that employ siamese network for maintaining a queue of negative samples through momentum encoder is MoCo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. On the other end of the spectrum, SimCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> technique undertakes negative samples available in the current batch. Another approach has been proposed, i.e. BYOL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> that does not require negative samples, rather it uses augmented view of the available images to train its online networks, while maintaining a decent performance. Out of the aforementioned three, BYOL represents the closest match to the real-world situation.
<br class="ltx_break">Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have been adopted for federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> such as MAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, BEiT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and Swin Transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to overcome the data heterogeneity issues. Furthermore, the ViTs are also capable of learning representations from corrupted images using signal reconstruction. We refer these methods as augmentive modeling. Where constrastive learning relies on the data augmentations or large sample size, the ViTs achieve the same performance level due to their instrinsic characteristics.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning was first introduced by Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and has been popular due to its privacy preservation characteristics. FL paradigm eliminates the requirement of data sharing from client side while allowing models to train in a collaborative manner. Generally, the FL approaches train the model locally at the client side and maintain the aggregation of a global model at the server side. The aggregation and optimization of global model is carried out in an iterative manner through communication rounds between the server and the client, accordingly. The flow of the operations in FL is as follows:</p>

</ul>
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">There have been many algorithms in FL paradigm to aggregate the model updates, however the most popular of them is federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Local parameters are updated through multiple gradient descent updates, which increases the computation at the local node but decreases the amount of communication. Another similar approach for aggregating model updates is FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The main problem with such methods is the convergence that require large number of iterations, along with the heterogeneity of data and devices involved. Various methods have been proposed over the years to address non-IID data issue. These approaches can be generally categorized as methods focusing on aggregation and methods focusing on stability. The former strives for improving the efficiency of model aggregation process such as FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, while the latter pivots for stability of training process at the local nodes. The methods concerning stabilization include FedAMP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
The problem with the existing FL approaches is the assumption that the true labels for all the instances are available on devices. However, labeled data is a limited resource and require expertise when performed labeling. Even in some domains such as IoMT, labeling is synonymous to high costs. Another problem is associated with the heterogeneity of data from model initialization perspective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Some studies suggest that the problem of data heterogeneity can be alleviated by perform pre-training, however the use of ViTs have been considered to a more viable solution to address data heterogeneity issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, it is imperative to design FL-based methods that deal with both issues, i.e. data heterogeneity and label scarcity, respectively.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Contrastive networks employed in FL paradigm have shown promising results in alleviating non-IID problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The use of contrastive networks in FL is generally performed in two phases. The first phase extracts visual representations from distributed devices by performing collaborative pre-training on unlabeled data. This phase forwards the shared features and perform aggregation on model updates similar to conventional FL approaches. At the client side, local unlabeled data is utilized to perform comparative learning. The second phase performs fine-tuning using limited number of labels and pre-trained mode l from the previous phase. The second phase process is carried out via federated supervised learning on each device, respectively.
<br class="ltx_break">The works employing contrastive networks in FL paradigm undertake skewness concerning label distributions only. For instance, number of images are same with each client and the number of data instances are usually considered to be the more than 10K. Such assumption is not always true in real-world settings, therefore, it is yet to be observed how such methods perform when either of the aforementioned assumption does not hold. In this work, we propose the use of Swin transformer along with MAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to perform augmentive modeling as self-supervised task.

Augmentive modeling is performed in the first phase, which is referred to as self-supervised pre-training. The process of pre-training comprises of three steps. At each communication round, a local auto-encoder and decoder is trained at client side on unlabeled data. The weights of the local autoencoder are shared with the encoder at the server side. At server side a target and an online network is deployed having an encoder and projection head. The online network is responsible for updating the parameters of the target network via exponential moving average. The server shares the online network’s encoder weights with the clients. At the second phase, the client encoders are initialized with the global encoder weights and a linear classifier is stacked, accordingly. The fine-tuning is performed on labeled data as the client send only the encoder part to the online network for aggregation.</figcaption>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The workflow of the proposed SelfFed framework is shown in Figure 2. In the subsequent sections, we show that the proposed SelfFed framework is able to handle data heterogeneity as well as label scarcity problem. As shown in Figure 2, the proposed framework is divided into two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning stage concerning self-supervised federated learning. In pre-training stage, the augmentive modeling is exploited in order to learn representative knowledge in a distributed manner. In latter stage, federated models are fine-tuned by transferrence of representative knowledge from the previous stage to perform target task, respectively. For the augmentive modeling, we leverage MAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> method into our SelfFed framework. The reason for choosing MAE over BEiT is performance advantage as highlighted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. The MAE integrated SelfFed framework is denoted by SelfFed-MAE, accordingly. We provide details for the pre-training and fine-tuning of SelfFed-MAE in the subsequent subsections.</p>

The online network takes into account the former view while the target networks considers the later view of the image. These views undergo the encoder to extract the higher dimensional representation. Existing work such as MoCo-V2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> has validated the effectiveness of projection heads in FL paradigm. The projection heads outputs the representations in lower dimension. We used the same configuration of projection head as in existing studies, i.e. two linear layers with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation. It is shown through Figure 2, that the local encoders share the weights with online network only. Although the structure for both the target and online networks are same the parameters of the target network needs to be updated through exponential moving average via online network. The formulation is shown in equation 4.</p>

The images corresponding negative examples are fed into both the encoder and the projection head to extract features followed by their storage in the memory bank. InfoNCE is then used to maintain the consistency between representations of the same images and the different ones. Based on the feature vectors a memory queue is generated that act as the sequence of local negatives in a FIFO mechanism so that the contrast loss with each input sample is computed. The memory queue stores new features and discards the older ones in a recursive manner.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.6" class="ltx_p">At each communication round in phase 2, the online network at the server side transmits the encoder to the clients. At the client side in phase 2, a linear classifier is added, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is added for the classification task. The ground truth labels from the limited labeled dataset are used to compute the cross-entropy loss, that is widely used for computer vision tasks. For each client, the objective function is minimized and weights are adjusted. Each client then sends the encoder part to the server for model aggregation. The server aggregates the encoder with the FC layers, which is then considered the updated online network. The updated network is then used for subsequent round of training. The pre-training part in phase 1 mainly deals with the data heterogeneity. However, for mitigating the label scarcity problem, we propose that the server should take into account the size of the dataset of the client and the frequency of client selection. The assumption is that the advantage of data associated with the client chosen several times dwindle, which limits the improvement concerning self-supervised learning. We proposes an aggregation mechanism that maps the degradation relationship in order to improve the self-supervised learning process. Each client performs an update with respect to the formulation shown in equation 6.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We validate the performance of SelfFed method on two IoMT related tasks. The first is the classification of COVID-19 and pneuomonia from chest X-rays, and the second is to use retinal fundus images for diabetic retinopathy detection. Both of the tasks differ in terms of label distributions, image acquisition, and image modalities, respectively. For instance, chest X-rays are acquired using X-ray scanners while the fundus images are captured using specialized camera.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the COVID-19 dataset, we adopt COVID-FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> that represents federated data partitions in real-world settings. The COVID-FL comprises over 20k chest X-ray images curated from eight data repositories that are available in public domain. More details on each of the repository is provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Each of the eight repositories are represented as a data site to mimic a medical institution in FL paradigm. It also complies with data heterogeneity and label scarcity issues as classes might vary in the dataset corresponding to specific sites. Furthermore, the acquisition machines that obtained X-ray images were different, along with the patient populations. Therefore, the dataset naturally emulates the data heterogeneity and label scarcity issues. We follow the same protocol as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, such that the split ratio for training and testing is set to 80% and 20%, which yields around 16k training and 4k testing images. The proportion of the data at each site is homogeneous. Each client (i.e. hospital) is considered to be a test set that can be held out for evaluation.</p>

In this regard, such clients are partitioned further into sub-clients without coinciding. After such partitioning, the total number of clients stand at 12 for COVID-FL dataset.
<br class="ltx_break">For Retina dataset, we consider Dirichlet distribution as suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> to model non-IID and IID characteristics.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To validate the efficacy of the SelfFed-MAE approach, we compare our results with some baseline methods that include Swin Transformer (from scratch), ImageNet pre-training with Swin Transformer, ImageNet pre-training with ViT, ImageNet pre-training with BEiT, and ImageNet pre-training with MAE. For both the datasets, the baseline approaches are pre-trained on ImageNet22K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> in a centralized manner, while the Swin Transformer (from scratch) is trained in a decentralized manner. Additionally, for COVID-FL, we compare our approach with pre-trained Swin Transformer, ViT, BEiT, and MAE, on CXR14 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> which comprises of around 112K images. We run the fine-tuning process for 1K communication rounds and 100 communication rounds for the networks trained from scratch and for pre-trained networks, respectively. The results are reported in Figure 3, 4, and 5. The results show that the SelfFed-MAE is consistent in terms of result on both the dataset concerning data heterogeneity problem. Methods such as MAE and BEiT pre-trained on ImageNet show a large discrepancy (drop) in accuracy. Even when the heterogeneity level of the data is severe the proposed method yields not only the best accuracy but also a consistent hold over the performance degradation. We observe maximum accuracy improvement on Retina and COVID-FL dataset, i.e. 8.8% and 4.1%, using SelfFed-MAE over pre-trained networks, respectively.</p>

We use 10%, 30%, and 70% of labeled samples at the SelfFed fine-tuning stage, which results in 1K, 3K, and 6K labeled images, respectively. The results for this experiment are reported in Figure 6. Even with 10% of the labeled samples, our method achieves better performance in comparison to other baselines while using 100% of the labeled data in both IID and non-IID settings. The results for training Swin Transformer from scratch is compliant with the existing works as it does not perform well under less number of labeled samples.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper addresses an understudied scenario in FL paradigm where both the data heterogeneity and label scarcity issues are handled simultaneously. We proposed SelfFed framework that used augmentive modeling by leveraging MAE method to deal with data heterogeneity. We also propose a novel constrastive network that handles two views of an instance and propose a novel aggregation strategy that reduces the impact of a client who participated various times in the fine-tuning process. The fine-tuning stage comprising of our contrastive network and novel aggregation strategy overcomes the label scarcity issue. We illustrate with our experimental results that the proposed SelfFed is efficient when using non-IID data and performs better than existing baselines such as Swin Transformer pre-trained on ImageNet, ViT pre-trained on ImageNet, MAE pre-trained on ImageNet, and BEiT pre-trained on ImageNet. Our results also indicate that the SelfFed framework is successful in handling label scarcity, while outperforming existing baselines to the best of our knowledge.</p>
