<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id6.id1.1" class="ltx_text">This paper explores concurrent FL processes
within a three-tier system,
with edge servers between edge devices and FL servers.
A challenge in this setup is
the limited
bandwidth from edge devices to edge servers.
Thus, allocating the bandwidth efficiently and fairly to support simultaneous FL processes becomes crucial.
We propose a game-theoretic approach to model the bandwidth allocation problem
and develop
distributed and centralized heuristic schemes to
find an approximate Nash Equilibrium of the game.
Through rigorous analysis and experimentation,
we demonstrate that our schemes efficiently and fairly assign the
bandwidth to the FL processes
and outperform a baseline scheme where each edge server assigns bandwidth proportionally to the FL servers’ requests that it receives.
The proposed distributed and centralized schemes have similar performance.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A substantial amount of training data from multiple sources
is important to develop top-notch machine learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Due to the proliferation of smartphones and devices, wearable devices, and IoT sensors,
a significant portion of data produced these days is acquired beyond the cloud,
particularly at the distributed end devices at the edge.
Hence, much valuable real-world data exists in a highly distributed manner,
which could be utilized to train deep-learning models and develop more precise and intelligent applications.
Even though these smart devices collectively hold a substantial amount of valuable data,
their sensitive nature and diverse constraints
- such as privacy concerns of their owners and privacy laws
- make it extremely difficult
for companies to utilize or integrate such data without explicit consent for a special purpose.
As a result, methods that retain data on the local device
while sharing the model have become more appealing.
Traditional centralized learning needs all data to be gathered and
stored in a central location on a data center or cloud server,
which raises the concern of privacy risks and data leakage.
To overcome the challenges mentioned above,
federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm of distributed machine learning that
orchestrates model training across mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL has taken an important and even faster-growing role in
the trend of decentralizing machine learning and
making learning more privacy-preserving.
The distributed nature has benefited from
the cloud-edge computing paradigm
that has already been widely adopted in the industry.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Earlier research on FL has typically assumed
a two-tier architecture,
i.e., a central server and multiple end devices.
In this setup, the central server can be a cloud server located deep within the Internet
or an edge server positioned at the network edge.
While a cloud server can access a vast number of end devices and
train deep learning models using massive datasets,
the communication between the server and the end devices can be slow and unpredictable
due to long and dynamic network connections.
Conversely, an edge server can only connect with nearby end devices and
utilize their limited datasets, but
the communication between the server and the end devices is more efficient
due to short-range communication and low latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The above tradeoff has further motivated the proposal of three-tier architectures
such as the client-edge-cloud hierarchical system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>,
where end devices form a large base of clients,
a cloud server acts as the central parameter server for the FL process,
and a number of edge servers lie in the middle connecting the above two tiers.
This emerging architecture is expected to combine the advantages of
both the cloud server based and the edge server-based two-tier architecture,
and to deliver good scalability and performance at the same time.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As FL becomes increasingly popular, multiple FL processes could be ongoing simultaneously. Hence, in this paper, we extend the client-edge-cloud hierarchy into a more general three-tier architecture, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Fair Allocation of Bandwidth At Edge Servers For Concurrent Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, where multiple cloud-based FL servers could be at the top tier. The middle-tier edge servers should service the resource requests from the multiple ongoing FL processes led respectively by the multiple FL servers in the cloud. For example, the edge servers should allocate their communication bandwidth to connect the FL servers to their clients, which are end devices at the edge.
Ideally, each FL server should be able to communicate with as many of its clients as possible for fast convergence in learning. However, edge servers only have limited bandwidth and thus may not be able to simultaneously service all the requests from all the FL servers. Hence, it is a research problem how the middle-tier edge servers should allocate their bandwidth to achieve the following two goals: the bandwidth is utilized as fully as possible, and the allocation of bandwidth to cloud servers is as fair as possible. Note that the allocation decision should be made in a distributed manner because the involved parties have their own interests, and it is difficult to obtain their global state.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above research problem, we propose a game-theoretic approach. Specifically, we define a game to model the interactions among the three-tier components. Each edge server owns a certain amount of bandwidth and sells them at a certain price to maximize its profit, which is the product of the sold bandwidth units and the price. Meanwhile, each cloud server has a certain amount of funds and uses the fund to purchase bandwidth from all edge servers it connects with so that it can communicate with as many end devices as possible. We formalize each participant’s strategies, utilities, and constraints and define and solve the Nash Equilibrium, with which the allocation of the edge servers’ bandwidth is optimal because the bandwidth is fully utilized and fairly distributed to cloud servers based on their funds. In addition to the above theoretical study, we also developed a distributed scheme that allows the edge servers and cloud servers to find an allocation of the bandwidth with high utility and fair allocation without any central point of control. Due to the distributed nature, such a scheme should be feasible for practical application.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed distributed scheme. The experiments consider various scenarios with heterogeneous conditions and compare to two reference schemes, i.e., the centralized scheme with a hypothetical central point of control and a baseline (distributed) scheme where each edge server simply allocates its bandwidth to requesting cloud servers proportionally to their request sizes. The results show that our proposed distributed scheme performs similarly to the centralized scheme but outperforms the baseline scheme.
A substantial amount of training data from diverse sources is vital for advanced machine learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. As data is increasingly generated outside the cloud from smartphones, wearables, and IoT sensors, this valuable decentralized data can enhance deep-learning models for more precise and intelligent applications. However, privacy concerns and laws make it difficult for companies to use or integrate user data without explicit consent. To address this, Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a new approach, orchestrating model training across edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Due to the prominent features, many FL processes are commonly ongoing at any time. However, FL faces many challenges, including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy preservation.
This paper focuses on addressing the challenge of communication efficiency, especially the uplink bandwidth.
Furthermore, the limited communication resources on edge devices, where FL clients locate, pose additional challenges to communication efficiency. When many FL processes are ongoing
concurrently, it further emerges as a new problem as how do we coordinate the simultaneous tasks regarding resource scheduling among the FL clients involved in these FL processes. In networked systems nowadays, edge servers can play an important role in coordination and optimization
as they connect servers and their overlapping pools of clients. Research on FL has typically
assumed a hierarchical architecture where the central server is in the top tier and edge devices are in the bottom tier. In this architecture, a central server can
be a cloud server located deep within the Internet or an
edge device positioned at the network edge. While a cloud server can access many edge devices and train deep learning models using a larger dataset, the communication between the server and the edge devices can be slow and unpredictable due to long and dynamic network
connections. Conversely, communication between the edge server and the edge
devices are more efficient due to short-range communication
and low latency and utilize their limited datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. This situation motivates us to trade-offs between cloud and edge server-based architectures, cloud servers with access to extensive training data samples, and edge servers, enabling quick model updates in low latency.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has proposed a new multi-tier hierarchical architecture in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Fair Allocation of Bandwidth At Edge Servers For Concurrent Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> to address the uplink bandwidth allocation problem and provided detailed game-theoretic formulation, design, experiments, and system evaluation. The proposed hierarchical structure has multiple FL servers at the top, multiple edge servers in the middle, and edge devices at the bottom.
The concurrent operation of multiple federated learning servers improves scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance and enables geographically distributed collaborations, resulting in enhanced efficiency and resilience of federated learning processes.</p>

<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a virtual market is built to model and address the bandwidth allocation problem where edge servers compete by selling the bandwidth and making a profit.
The FL servers compete to acquire as much uplink bandwidth from the edge servers with certain available funds. This competitive behavior can be seen in an oligopolistic market in which the edge servers and the FL servers are motivated to act based on their self-interests instead of social benefit. In this scenario, we model the interaction between the FL and edge servers to address the bandwidth scheduling problem as a Stackleberg Game <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>

is challenging mainly because
FL servers compete for bandwidth at edge servers.

multiple FL servers to communicate with their FL clients respectively,

we assume the system that we study is a completing system,

Note that, if an FL server is not part of a competing system,
it is trivial to assign bandwidth to the server; i.e., for each edge server,
this FL server can simply be assigned with either its requested bandwidth
or the bandwidth affordable by the edge server, whichever is smaller.</p>

Recall that, a Stacklerberg Game models a decision-making system
that involves a leader and followers taking turns making choices.
The leader is the first to select its strategy,

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of each edge server is to gain high income from selling its bandwidth,
and that of each FL server is to purchase as much bandwidth as possible
for its clients using a given fund.
Note that, in this game model, a FL server’s utility does not factor in
the cost (i.e., the consumption of fund), because the FL server is
expected to purchase as much bandwidth using the available fund.
Their utilities should quantify the degree of satisfying their goals; also, it is natural that
the marginal increase of utilities should be diminishing.
Hence, we have the following definitions.</p>

According to Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem4" title="Theorem 4. ‣ III-G Solution of Nash Equilibrium ‣ III Game-Theoretic Formulation and Analysis ‣ Fair Allocation of Bandwidth At Edge Servers For Concurrent Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>,
a solution to the optimization problem (<a href="#S3.E10" title="In III-G Solution of Nash Equilibrium ‣ III Game-Theoretic Formulation and Analysis ‣ Fair Allocation of Bandwidth At Edge Servers For Concurrent Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>)-(<a href="#S3.E15" title="In III-G Solution of Nash Equilibrium ‣ III Game-Theoretic Formulation and Analysis ‣ Fair Allocation of Bandwidth At Edge Servers For Concurrent Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>)
is a Nash Equilibrium; that is,
if there is a solution to the optimization problem, the game should have Nash Equilibrium.
Hence, we only need to show the optimization problem has a solution.</p>

We prepare the MNIST dataset in a non-iid manner regarding class label distribution. There are two distributions: first, each client has data samples of only 1 class label; second, each client has data samples of 2 class labels. The distribution of the data sample is equal to each client.
We use a simple CNN classifier with a PyTorch sequential model
consisting of two convolutional layers and two FC layers.
The model uses the ReLU activation function.
The momentum is 0.5 and the learning rate is 0.01.
Each concurrent FL process runs for 20 global rounds,
each global round consists of 50 epochs.

(i.e., clients are uniformly distributed to edge servers),
the baseline and the game-theoretic schemes achieve similar test accuracy,
as shown in the last rows of
Tables <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table I ‣ V-D3 Heterogeneity of Required Bandwidth Per Client ‣ V-D Evaluation Results I: Clients Acquired by FL Servers under a Variety of Heterogeneity ‣ V Evaluations ‣ Fair Allocation of Bandwidth At Edge Servers For Concurrent Hierarchical Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.
In the first experiment,
each client has training data with only 1 class label;
in another experiment,
each client has training data with 2 class labels.
Therefore, not all FL servers can obtain models
trained from the data with most class labels.
Particularly,
if an FL server acquires a small number of clients,
its model is trained based on the data with only a few class labels.
Also, since
clients are randomly selected from the client pool,
an FL server could receive a model updated based on the data with
different number of class labels
in different rounds.
Thus, testing accuracy varies in rounds,
even though they get model updates from the same number of clients.
As we can see, the baseline scheme does not assign bandwidth fairly.

<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Research focuses on adapting the FL algorithm
to mitigate the communication load on the network,
involving techniques like
selecting clients that demonstrate notable training advancements,
compressing gradient vectors through quantization, or
speeding up training through sparse or structured updates.
Works show the development of new optimization and model aggregation algorithms such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a QSFL framework that optimizes FL uplink communication overhead from two levels:
rejecting redundant clients uploading model updates and
compressing models to unique segments for uploading.
Studies are also conducted to reduce communication costs
by shifting extensive model aggregations to the edge.
This approach avoids substantial communication overhead to the cloud
while maintaining learning performance.
Consequently, studies have focused on
the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework and explored communication efficiency issues.
A concept of Hierarchical Federated Learning networks has been put forth in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>,
where several edge servers initially conduct partial model aggregation.
A cloud server subsequently combines these intermediate results to generate the final model.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>,
they formulate a joint computation and communication resource allocation and edge association problem
for device users under Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HFEL) framework
to achieve global cost minimization.</p>

The authors introduced an effective algorithm to determine the optimal number of clusters while considering resource limitations,
and they carried out the training using edge computing.
Yang et al. introduced an architecture in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> for Hierarchical Federated Learning (H-FL).</p>

<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The authors develop a strategy to reconstruct the runtime distribution to counteract the degradation caused by non-IID data.
Additionally, they design a mechanism for compression correction that reduces communication overhead without compromising model performance.
Deng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> formulated the communication cost minimization (CCM) problem
to decrease the communication costs that arise from combining models from the edge and cloud within the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework.
The authors suggest that
improving the uniformity of the training data at the edge aggregator
can greatly enhance the performance of Federated Learning (FL).
They propose SHARE, which stands for SHaping dAta distRibution at Edge,
to efficiently solve the CCM problem by modifying the data distribution at the edge.

Feng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> used a Stackelberg game model
to analyze self-organized mobile devices’ transmission and training data pricing strategies and the model owner’s learning service subscription in the cooperative federated learning system.
Zou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> employed an evolutionary game theory to dynamically model the strategies of mobile devices
with bounded rationality in the federated learning system.
As far as we know, none of the previous works have addressed the scenarios where
multiple federated servers run simultaneously,
with edge servers serving as intermediaries between FL servers and edge devices.
Our paper tackles such scenarios with a game-theoretic approach.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studied the bandwidth allocation problem in
a three-tier FL system with multiple FL processes run concurrently.
We proposed a Stackelberg game-theoretic approach to formulate the problem and
designed heuristic distributed and centralized schemes to find an approximate Nash Equilibrium of the game.
We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results indicate that
our proposed scheme can efficiently and fairly allocate bandwidth at edge servers to support concurrent FL processes.</p>
