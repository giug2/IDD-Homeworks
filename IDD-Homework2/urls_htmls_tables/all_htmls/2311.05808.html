<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is known for its capability to safeguard participants’ data privacy. However, recently emerged model inversion attacks (MIAs) have shown that a malicious parameter server can reconstruct individual users’ local data samples through model updates. The state-of-the-art attacks either rely on computation-intensive search-based optimization processes to recover each input batch, making scaling difficult, or they involve the malicious parameter server adding extra modules before the global model architecture, rendering the attacks too conspicuous and easily detectable.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">To overcome these limitations, we propose Scale-MIA, a novel MIA capable of efficiently and accurately recovering training samples of clients from the aggregated updates, even when the system is under the protection of a robust secure aggregation protocol. Unlike existing approaches treating models as black boxes, Scale-MIA recognizes the importance of the intricate architecture and inner workings of machine learning models. It identifies the latent space as the critical layer for breaching privacy and decomposes the complex recovery task into an innovative two-step process to reduce computation complexity. The first step involves reconstructing the latent space representations (LSRs) from the aggregated model updates using a closed-form inversion mechanism, leveraging specially crafted adversarial linear layers. In the second step, the whole input batches are recovered from the LSRs by feeding them into a fine-tuned generative decoder.</p>
<p id="id3.id3" class="ltx_p">We implemented Scale-Scale-MIA on multiple commonly used machine learning models and conducted comprehensive experiments across various settings. The results demonstrate that Scale-MIA achieves excellent recovery performance on different datasets, exhibiting high reconstruction rates, accuracy, and attack efficiency on a larger scale compared to state-of-the-art MIAs.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework that enables its participants to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their individual datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Within this framework, the training process occurs iteratively between a central parameter server and a group of clients. During each training round, the parameter server first broadcasts a global model with a pre-agreed model architecture to all or a fraction of clients. The server then collects and aggregates the model updates (gradient or parameter updates) submitted by the clients, which are trained and derived from their respective local datasets. As no individual training data samples are exchanged between participants in this process, federated learning is widely recognized as a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving learning paradigm.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, recent research reveals that the privacy of FL is susceptible to breaches, enabling attackers to infer information about clients’ proprietary datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Of particular concern are the <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model inversion attacks (MIAs or gradient inversion attacks)</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>,
in which the adversary tries to reconstruct the original client training data from the model updates submitted by the clients. In these attacks, <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the parameter server is considered an honest-but-curious attacker</span> whose goal is to closely approximate the input samples by minimizing the distance between real gradients uploaded by an individual client and those generated by approximated dummy samples. These attacks can successfully reconstruct high-fidelity input images when the server gains access to individual model updates and undergoes sufficient optimization iterations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To counter these attacks, Bonawitz et al. propose the <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">secure aggregation (SA) protocol</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to prevent the server from gaining knowledge about individual model updates. Secure aggregation is a specialized secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol that allows clients to securely compute the summation of model updates without exposing individual values. As a result, SA ensures that the parameter server can only know the aggregated model updates and is mathematically unable to distinguish individual updates from random numbers. SA is considered one of the most robust defense mechanisms against various inference attacks targeting federated learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and several follow-up works have been proposed to further reduce the communication and computation overhead of the original SA protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, recent development in privacy attacks shows that the SA protocol is breakable when the attacker is able to modify the model parameters or architectures, which <span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">goes beyond the honest-but-curious threat model</span>.
Two distinct attack strategies have been identified to break the SA protocol. The first strategy involves obtaining individual model updates (gradients) or their approximations from the aggregated results by carefully manipulating the global model parameters and having the gradients of the target client dominate the aggregated result. This can be achieved by eliminating the gradients of all other clients except the target <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, or amplifying only the gradients of the target victim <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The attacker then utilizes the individual gradients to perform gradient inversion attacks, attempting to reconstruct the original inputs. The limitation of these attacks is that they still require the costly per-input batch optimization process as part of the gradient inversion step.
The second strategy involves a more direct approach to reconstructing the inputs from the aggregated results. To accomplish this, existing work requires the attacker to insert either a two-layer linear module <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> or a convolutional module <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> before the pre-agreed global model architecture, as well as possessing an auxiliary dataset. These modules are meticulously crafted or trained using the auxiliary dataset, enabling the attacker to reconstruct the inputs from the gradients of layers within these modules, using customized analytical methods when receiving local updates from the clients. However, this approach of modifying the pre-agreed model architecture is highly conspicuous and is unlikely to be accepted by the clients.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel and robust model inversion attack named Scale-MIA, designed to be scalable, efficient, and highly effective. Scale-MIA is capable of recovering a large batch of inputs directly from the aggregated results, even if the SA protocol is in place. Notably, Scale-MIA is stealthy, requiring no modifications to the pre-agreed model architecture. Our attack strategy eliminates the need for a costly per batch or sample search-based optimization process, resulting in significant computational speed-up while achieving accurate data retrieval.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A key reason behind the high computation complexity in existing MIA works is that they treat machine-learning models as black boxes. To design a more efficient attack, we delve into the architecture of machine learning models and focus on the <span id="S1.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">latent space</span>, which corresponds to the layer right after the convolutional modules (e.g., AlexNet, VGGNet) and vision transformer (ViT) modules. We identify this layer as the most critical component for realizing efficient gradient inversion, given that it serves as the fundamental “information bottleneck” of the entire model architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to a typical machine learning system that comprises a training phase and an inference phase, the proposed Scale-MIA also involves two distinct phases—the <span id="S1.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adversarial model generation</span> phase and the actual <span id="S1.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">input reconstruction</span> phase.
The adversarial model generation can be done offline by the attacker, i.e., malicious parameter server, and it only needs to be done once at the outset. The purpose is to generate a crafted adversarial global model that the attacker will distribute to the clients during the FL iterations. To generate the adversarial model, the attacker first trains a surrogate autoencoder, with its encoder being identical to the encoder of the real global model, and a customized generative decoder capable of reconstructing the inputs, utilizing the collected auxiliary dataset. Subsequently, the attacker feeds the auxiliary dataset to the already-trained encoder, enabling the estimate of essential statistical parameters for crafting an adversarial global model. This adversarial global model follows exactly the same architecture as the pre-agreed model architecture and serves as a crucial component to facilitate the actual inversion attack in the second phase. </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the second phase, the attacker disseminates the crafted adversarial global model to the clients and awaits local updates from them. Assuming the presence of the secure aggregation (SA) protocol, the attacker only receives the aggregated gradients (model updates) from these clients. The proposed input reconstruction method takes the aggregated gradients (model updates) as input and aims to recover as many original inputs as possible. To significantly reduce the complexity of the inversion attacks, we design a novel gradient inversion method, in which we decompose the reconstruction phase into a two-step recovery process, each with much lower computation complexity. We first disaggregate the received local model update into batched latent space representations (LSRs) through a closed-form “linear leakage” module and then feed these representations into the pre-trained generative decoder to recover the original input batch. As both recovery steps only involve linear-complexity operations, the overall inversion process becomes super efficient to conduct. Note the attack phase can be executed in a single federated learning round and is adaptable for launch at any desired time. </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Three factors could significantly impact the performance of Scale-MIA—The batch size that Scale-MIA can recover depends on the number of neurons in the first linear layer of the target model, the recovery accuracy is sensitive to the quantity and quality of the auxiliary dataset, and the recovery rate relies on the availability of a good statistical estimation of the distribution of LSRs.
Unfortunately, in practical scenarios, the first and third factors do not pose a significant barrier for the attacker. Popular machine-learning models commonly feature large linear layers and real-world data often follows a Gaussian distribution, contributing to better attack performance. The data quality of the auxiliary dataset remains an uncertain factor. Nonetheless, the attacker can enhance attack performance by leveraging publicly available datasets or manually collecting samples relevant to its target. Our experiments demonstrate that the attacker can successfully execute a highly effective inference attack using only open datasets or even just a few hundred targeted samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed Scale-MIA attack. A thorough comparison was made between our attack and existing MIAs using various image classification datasets, including Fashion MNIST (FMNIST) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, CIFAR-10, and the skin cancer dataset (HMNIST) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The results show a significant improvement in terms of attack accuracy, reconstruction fidelity, and efficiency when using Scale-MIA. We also evaluated Scale-MIA’s performance under different data settings, including variations in data amount and whether the data was iid or non-iid. The results consistently highlighted the success of Scale-MIA across all these settings. Particularly noteworthy is the results demonstrate that the attacker can effectively launch a targeted attack using his collected dataset over a specific class.</p>

Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> first identify this problem, and propose the deep leakage from gradient (DLG) attack which chooses the second norm as the distance function, and uses the L-BFGS optimizer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to solve the optimization problem. Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> find that the DLG attack does not always achieve convergence or return the ground-truth labels consistently. Therefore, the paper proposes an improved version of the DLG attack by first recovering the ground-truth label from the gradients with an analytical method and then reconstructing the original images with higher confidence. Geiping et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> further improve the optimization tool and achieve better image reconstruction fidelity, but requires a strong assumption as the labels of the inputs must be known. Yin et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> focus on reconstructing batched inputs instead of individual ones on the ImageNet dataset and ResNet model architecture, making the attack more practical. Hatamizadeh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> customize the attack for the vision transformer and achieve better performance than previous attacks.
However, these optimization-based gradient inversion attacks are computationally costly and need hundreds of optimization iterations to reconstruct one input batch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Many of them (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>) only perform well for a single or small batch of images (typically smaller than 16), representing a scalability challenge.</p>

Aono et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> analyze the privacy leakage of the linear models and show that the inputs to the linear layers can be perfectly reconstructed from the gradients, which is referred to as the “linear leakage”.

Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> propose an analytical recursive attack on privacy (R-GAP) to reconstruct the input layer by layer back from the output layer, particularly targeting linear and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> propose an analytical reconstruction attack specialized for the vision transformer (ViT) and can reconstruct high-fidelity images. But unfortunately, each of these analytical attacks is only designed for its own model architecture and cannot be generalized for others. Furthermore, they only perform well when assuming the reconstruction size is small.</p>

This implies that nothing more than the final aggregated results is leaked to the attacker.
Because the final results are aggregated from all training samples submitted by all participants, it is considered a large enough batch that is beyond the capability of previous gradient inversion attacks.
The SA protocol also has other properties such as communication efficiency and drop-out resilience, making it one of the most robust defense mechanisms against the federated learning privacy inference attacks.
The follow-up works further improve the performance of the original SA protocol by reducing the communication and computation overheads <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, enabling verifiable aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and bolstering the robustness of the secure aggregation against malicious attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although SA is designed to prevent the parameter server from knowing the individual gradients, recent work shows that the malicious parameter server can still recover the inputs just from the aggregated results.

This type of attack seeks to overturn SA’s main function by inferring the individual gradients (i.e., before SA) from the aggregated results. To achieve this, Wen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> propose a “fishing strategy” that magnifies the gradient of a targeted class to dominate the aggregated result by crafting the model parameters. The attack aims to generate a close-enough approximation of the individual gradients out of the final aggregated gradients, which is enough for the attacker to reconstruct the original images through existing optimization-based gradient inversion attacks.
Pasquini et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> propose a gradient suppression attack that zeros out all the gradient updates except the target victim’s, making the final aggregated result identical to the gradient of the target client. The attack achieves this by crafting the parameters of a single linear layer and keeping the outputs of that specific layer to be always smaller than zero, which further leads to zero gradients if the ReLU activation function is used.
Although the gradient disaggregation attacks can successfully break the SA protocol, they usually serve as the prerequisite attack to launch the gradient inversion attacks and are subject to the costly optimization overhead introduced by inversion steps. Moreover, this type of attack intrinsically assumes the batch size for calculating each gradient update is small, which may, unfortunately, violate the settings of some application scenarios such as for cross-silo federated learning.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Large Batch Reconstruction Attacks:</span> Another attack strategy to break the SA is to directly reconstruct the whole input batch from the final aggregated results, treating the SA as a black box. This is a challenging problem and the existing attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> have strong assumptions to accomplish it, including letting the attacker modify the pre-agreed model architecture
and possessing an auxiliary dataset that has a similar distribution as the clients’ training dataset. Fowl et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> propose to attach an extra module of two linear layers to the pre-agreed architecture with adversarial parameters generated from the statistical information of the auxiliary dataset and the global batch size information. By customizing the extra module, the attacker can leverage the “linear leakage” primitive to perfectly reconstruct the original inputs with arbitrarily large batch sizes. Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> improve this attack by adding a convolutional module before the original model architecture. By doing this the attacker can recover a larger batch of inputs with a smaller number of attack module parameters and support non-iid data settings. The key drawback of these attacks is that they require the attacker to either change the pre-agreed model architecture significantly during the training time or force the participants to agree on the model architecture he desires before, which is an overly strong assumption in practice.</p>

Compared to the existing large-batch reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, Scale-MIA assumes weaker attacker capability and is more stealthy and hard to detect.</p>

The equation shows that there are two aggregation phases involved in the training procedure including the local aggregation among all samples when each client calculates the gradient and the global aggregation over the gradients from all clients. Conceptually, the FL process can be viewed as a gradient descent process on an abstract global training batch containing all samples in the local batches, i.e., <math id="S3.SS1.p1.21.m5.1"

This approach also lacks a fundamental “disaggregation step” and the reversed results are usually still mixed together for batched inputs.

This observation motivates us to target the latent space as the key layer for Scale-MIA, as it is the “information bottleneck” of the entire architecture, preserving essential input data information while maintaining lower dimensions for efficient processing. In our approach, we decompose the inversion problem into two sub-problems— first recovering the LSRs from the aggregated gradients and subsequently recovering inputs from the LSRs.
Fortunately, we can utilize the linear leakage primitive with the first two layers in the MLP to recover the LSRs. This is a closed-form solution that ensures both recovery accuracy and small linear computation complexity.

There are three main factors that affect the performance of Scale-MIA. The first one is the neuron number of the first linear layer, denoted by <math id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>. This is because we adopt the linear leakage primitive as a component in our attack and therefore, our attack is subject to its constraints. Fortunately, the current neuron numbers of the first linear layers of the popular machine learning models are very large, typically more than one thousand (typical numbers: 1024/4096), which is enough for the attacker to reconstruct hundreds of samples simultaneously. Ideally, the attacker can reconstruct an input batch with size <math id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p1.2.m2.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>. But in practice, because of imperfect statistical estimation and data bias, this upper bound is never reached. In general, the larger the batch size is, the higher the probability there are collisions in the recovery bins. All collided images in a bin are mixed up and their recovery fails. In our experiment, we find that the attacker is able to recover images with a high recovery rate (<math id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\geq 0.6" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml"></mi><mo id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">≥</mo><mn id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">0.6</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1"><geq id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1"></geq><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">absent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">0.6</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p1.3.m3.1c">\geq 0.6</annotation></semantics></math>) when the batch size is smaller than half of the neuron number <math id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\frac{k}{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1a"><mfrac id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">k</mi><mn id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></mfrac><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1"><divide id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1"></divide><ci id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.2">𝑘</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p1.4.m4.1c">\frac{k}{2}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

In the ideal case, if the auxiliary dataset has the same distribution as the training dataset, the attacker can recover every sample in the training dataset. But in practice, there are usually data biases, and the auxiliary dataset cannot precisely represent the distribution of the training dataset. Fortunately, Scale-MIA enables the attacker to launch the targeted attack, which means even if the attacker cannot reconstruct all the samples with an amount-deficient and biased dataset, he can still infer a target class if there are enough data samples in that class. In other words, the attacker needs to collect as many data samples as possible for his target class, and the more he collects, the better the attack performs.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The third factor that affects the performance of Scale-MIA is whether the attacker can have a good estimation for the required CDF. The problem is whether the ground-truth CDF of the LSRs could be accurately estimated, for it may exhibit uncommon distributions and become hard to model and estimate. Fortunately, in our experiment, we find that the LSRs usually exhibit Gaussian or Laplace distribution and can be easily and accurately estimated.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Attack Overhead:</span> The major overhead imposed by Scale-MIA is in the adversarial model generation phase, or more specifically, the training process of the autoencoder. Except this, the CDF estimation step and model crafting step only involve analytical operations and are efficient to be performed. Fortunately, Scale-MIA allows this phase to be conducted fully offline and the attacker can leverage any computation resource to fulfill this. The attacker can also resort to finding publicly available pre-trained autoencoders because there are many pre-trained autoencoders available on the Internet that cover most of the popular machine-learning models. The attacker can directly use them if the FL framework chooses the global models among these popular model architectures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The input reconstruction phase (i.e., the attack phase) also only imposes very small overheads because this phase only requires closed-form matrix computation or feed-forward operations in already trained neural networks with linear complexity. A unique advantage of Scale-MIA is that the attacker can iteratively use the trained autoencoder to launch attacks for multiple rounds, i.e. “train once, and attack multiple rounds”.
In our experiment, we will show that Scale-MIA’s computation time for reconstructing one batch of input is more than 100 times smaller than the current costly optimization-based model inversion attacks.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Large Batch Reconstruction:</span> Scale-MIA enables the attacker to reconstruct a large batch of inputs simultaneously. To further improve the attack’s extendability to reconstruct different classes of data samples, the attacker can choose the large publicly available datasets as the auxiliary dataset. For example, the attacker can use the ImageNet dataset to train its autoencoder when he aims to recover images. The attacker may also train the autoencoder with a large medical dataset if he tries to recover some sensitive medical records.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Targeted Inference:</span> Another attack strategy for the attacker is to collect data samples for a certain target class to launch the targeted attack. For example, the attacker wants to infer the images of the “dog” class. What he needs to do is collect samples with the label “dog” as many as possible. As a result, even if the attacker can not recover the other classes of images, he can still recover the images with the label “dog” precisely. In practice, this gives the attacker the ability to obtain sensitive information for a certain victim class such as inferring the records of a certain group of patients. In our experiment, we will show that this is very practical and the attacker only needs to collect several hundred samples in order to obtain a decent attack performance.</p>

However, the individual gradients may still be an aggregated result with local batches and many of the existing attacks fail when the local batch size is large. They also suffer from the large computation overhead introduced by the costly iterative optimization rounds. Scale-MIA can be used to replace these attacks to enhance the disaggregation attacks, for Scale-MIA achieves better attack performance with significantly smaller attack overhead and larger attack scale.</p>

To make a fair comparison, we re-implemented all these attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset and with the Resnet model architecture unless this setting is not supported, for which we took the CNN instead. We focused on the average PSNR score and attack time (the time to recover one batch of inputs) metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the attacks on recovering sample batches whose sizes ranged from {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 256}.
We summarize the attack results in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 5.5 Practical Attack Scenarios ‣ 5 Attack Method ‣ Scale-MIA: A Scalable Model Inversion Attack against Secure Federated Learning via Latent Space Reconstruction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the experiment results, we observe that Scale-MIA outperforms all other attacks in terms of reconstruction accuracy, except the Robbing the fed attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which achieves a super-high accuracy because it has the strongest assumptions among all attacks.
We observe another interesting phenomenon: the average PSNR score for Scale-MIA increases as the batch size becomes larger, while all other attacks show the opposite trend. This may be because Scale-MIA is designed to recover large batches of inputs, and the impact of noise and uncertainty is exacerbated when the batch size is very small. The batch sizes we used in this experiment have reached or exceeded the performance upper bound of many attacks, but they have not yet reached the performance bottleneck of Scale-MIA.
In the next section, we will show that when the batch size continues to increase, Scale-MIA’s performance will reach its bottleneck and decrease with respect to batch sizes, showing a similar trend with others.

Particularly, the robbing the fed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> attack is a very powerful one as it achieved an even better PSNR score, and a similar level of attack efficiency performance on a large scale compared to Scale-MIA. But as we have discussed before, this is due to this attack having a much stronger assumption—being able to significantly modify the pre-agreed model architecture, which Scale-MIA does not need.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We implemented Scale-MIA on various model architectures, including convolutional neural network (CNN), AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, and ViT. Because the original Resnet and Vit only have a single linear layer after the encoder module, we mark an asterisk beside them, indicating that Scale-MIA only applies to their modified version with two linear layers.
We evaluated Scale-MIA’s performance in terms of reconstruction rate and average PSNR score of the successfully recovered samples with respect to batch sizes ranging from {64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} to validate Scale-MIA’s performance on recovering large batches. The experiment results are shown in Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 6.2 Benchmark Comparison ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Scale-MIA: A Scalable Model Inversion Attack against Secure Federated Learning via Latent Space Reconstruction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the results, we can see that in general Scale-MIA achieves high PSNR scores for all model architectures and batch sizes. There is no performance pitfall that leads to a significantly small PSNR score lower than our threshold, which means that all the successfully recovered samples are of good quality, even for very large input batches. Meanwhile, we observe that the recovery rate is monotonically decreasing with respect to larger batch sizes.
This is reasonable and in line with our expectation, as larger recovery batches increase the probability of recovery collisions and failures.

We observe that the LSR distribution of the CIFAR-10 and FMINIST datasets are highly similar to the Gaussian distribution and are easier to estimate. However, we notice a high peak in the distribution of the HMNIST dataset, which indicates its estimation is unstable. This can be verified by checking the recovery rate performance of ViT, Resnet, and VGG, for in these cases, the recovery rate of HMNIST is significantly smaller than the other two datasets. We consider this to be because of the intrinsic data bias of HMNIST. Compared to CIFAR-10 and FMNIST, HMNIST is much smaller to have only 5000 samples and some of its features may not follow the Gaussian distribution as most of the large datasets do. This leads to unstable and imperfect distribution estimation and finally affects the attack performance.</p>

We observe that the number of samples available to the attacker has very little impact on the recovery rate, as it remains relatively stable at high values across the full range of data availability. The PSNR score does decrease slightly when the number of samples decreases, but it remains to be in a decent range.
Specifically, even if the attacker only has 1% samples (500 images) of the training dataset, Scale-MIA still achieves very high recovery rates and PSNR scores in our experiment. This indicates that Scale-MIA is a practical attack and the attacker only needs to collect or generate a few hundred samples to obtain a decent attack performance.

The results show that data bias has a very limited impact on
the recovery rate, as it remains stable even when the attacker has only a few classes of samples. The decrease in PSNR score is also not significant, and even the worst value remains at a high level. These results demonstrate that Scale-MIA’s attack performance is robust against data bias.

Differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> has been widely used to protect training data privacy in machine learning systems recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. It has shown its effectiveness in protecting client-level and data record-level membership privacy for FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> by preventing the attacker from knowing whether one item (a client or a record) exists in the system.
Though DP can protect the FL system against membership inference attacks by its definition, it is demonstrated less effective against data reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.

In section <a href="#S5" title="5 Attack Method ‣ Scale-MIA: A Scalable Model Inversion Attack against Secure Federated Learning via Latent Space Reconstruction" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we discuss how to launch a targeted model inversion attack against a targeted class. However, in many situations, the attacker is more curious about sensitive information for a certain client.
Scale-MIA cannot accomplish this even if it can recover the whole batch in high fidelity because the attacker cannot
tell which recovered sample is from whom when SA protocol is in place. This is referred to as the “privacy by shuffling” property of the SA protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
To break this, Scale-MIA needs to be used in conjunction with the gradient disaggregation attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> by letting them first obtain the individual gradients from the victims and then using Scale-MIA as an enhancement to recover samples.</p>

Scale-MIA takes the “linear leakage” as its component, and as a result, it requires the model to have two consecutive linear layers. Although most of the existing model architectures have this module, some Resnet-based and ViT-based models do not. To conduct Scale-MIA on these models, the attacker must have stronger capabilities to add an extra linear layer at the end of the model.
Meanwhile, we observe that the ViT model contains built-in linear layers within its <math id="S7.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Enc" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">E</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">n</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml">c</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐸</ci><ci id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑛</ci><ci id="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S7.p3.1.m1.1.1.4">𝑐</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p3.1.m1.1c">Enc</annotation></semantics></math> module.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose Scale-MIA, a powerful MIA that breaks the strong SA mechanism by reconstructing the whole global batch simultaneously in an efficient manner. Scale-MIA launches the model inversion attack from a new angle by not treating the targeted model as a black box and decomposing the inversion problem in two steps including a LSR recovering step and an input generation step. Scale-MIA uses the closed-form “linear leakage” primitive to conduct the first step and a fine-tuned generative decoder for the second, making it highly efficient and suitable for large-scale reconstruction. With these distinct features, Scale-MIA represents a potent and inconspicuous approach to breach privacy in federated learning settings, prompting the need for robust defense mechanisms against such advanced attacks.</p>
