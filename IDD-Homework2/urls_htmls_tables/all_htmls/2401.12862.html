<p id="id16.id1" class="ltx_p">Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors. Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training. However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value. In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation. In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation. Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private. With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU. To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF. The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Roadside units (RSUs) are an important constituent of intelligent transportation systems (ITS).
They are often installed along roadsides, intersections, and other transportation scenarios and outfitted with various sensors and communication devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. With the rapid evolution of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, RSUs are able to offer significant added value for intelligent autonomous vehicles.
RSU perception can expand the field of view of autonomous vehicles, mitigate occlusion issues, and provide more accurate perception results for crucial categories such as pedestrians and cyclists <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, RSUs can serve as the central node of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, consolidating information from multiple autonomous vehicles and offering the potential to deploy more powerful computing devices for local training missions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At present, the RSU perception system only employs fixed machine-learning models for real-time situation awareness. Generally, these models are pre-trained on limited labeled datasets. Despite the fact that RSUs are equipped with high-resolution sensors capable of providing stable and precise scene observations, the continuously collected streaming data has not been effectively utilized to adapt the model to the current perceptual scene or to improve the model’s perceptual capability over time. From the model training perspective, a substantial portion of the streaming data remains underutilized.</p>
</div>
<figure id="S1.F1" class="ltx_figure"><img src="/html/2401.12862/assets/x1.png" id="S1.F1.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_square" width="438" height="428" alt="Refer to caption">
<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>FedRSU system overview, where multiple roadside units (RSUs) collaboratively train a scene flow estimation model without transmitting raw data under the coordination of a cloud server. Iteratively, each RSU trains a local model in a self-supervised manner, and the server aggregates local models. FedRSU can significantly alleviate the challenges of tedious labeling and limited data for one single RSU.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Two formidable challenges need to be addressed in order to leverage the infinite streaming data from RSU sensors to facilitate model training.
(1) The data labeling process is exceedingly arduous for transportation data. For RSU perception, the annotation of traffic data is crucial and advantageous for model training. However, the annotation process is always arduous and time-consuming, requiring extensive data storage, transmission, and manual labeling. The creation of annotated datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is always a laborious and expensive endeavor. It is unrealistic to annotate all the data collected by RSUs to continuously refine the perception model.
(2) Integrating data or models from multiple RSU edges is not trivial. In the intelligent transportation system, it is challenging to gather a massive amount of unlabeled data from various sources and train a universal model, as successfully achieved in computer vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> or natural language processing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The traffic scene data collected by RSUs may comprise a lot of sensitive information and cannot be shared publicly, such as camera data that contains sensitive facial features and vehicle license plate information. Moreover, the sheer amount of data makes it impossible to aggregate for centralized training due to communication bandwidth and storage limitations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In our design, we designate scene flow estimation as the principal task for each RSU. Scene flow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which is the 3D equivalent of optical flow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and describes the motion vector of points in 3D space.
Reasoning about motion and forecasting the future of a dynamic scene is particularly critical. Scene flow estimation can be a crucial task that supports various downstream tasks, including motion segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, instance segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, motion prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, trajectory prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and more. Also, scene flow is a commonly used representation format in self-supervised learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenge of traffic data annotation, our core idea is to use a recurrent self-supervision paradigm on every RSU client for scene flow estimation learning, as is shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. In transportation scenarios, one popular strategy of self-supervised learning is to obtain model guidance from sequential data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. With the constant stream of data, real-time scene flow prediction results of the deployed model can be supervised by subsequent future observations from RSU sensors. For each frame of the point cloud, its corresponding scene flow can be directly supervised by the succeeding frame of raw point cloud data. In this way, the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm consumes real-time sequential data, allowing for continuous learning and improvement. Additionally, given that RSUs are typically equipped with multi-modal sensors, we propose a multi-modal self-supervised learning method that leverages consecutive images to enhance the learning of point cloud scene flow.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenge of data integration, we introduce federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> as a promising solution. Federated learning offers a paradigm to collaboratively train a machine learning model under the coordination of a central server while keeping all training data on local devices.
With the power of FL, each RSU equipped with sensors and computational devices can train a local scene flow estimation model using its own extensive data and upload the model parameters for FL aggregation instead of transferring masses of raw data. In the whole training process, all training data are maintained decentralized.
Since RSUs are stationarily deployed at intersections, highways, parking lots, etc., the scene perceived by each RSU is fixed and limited. By fusing information from multiple RSUs in FL, the final global scene flow estimation model will be equipped with higher perception capability and generalization ability than the isolatedly trained local model.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 2: </span>The recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm. The prediction of the model can be supervised by the following frame of sensor data in a self-supervised manner. With the continuous data stream, the model can be continuously improved.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Integrating both solutions mentioned above, in this paper, we propose FedRSU, an FL framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation in the RSU scenarios. The FedRSU framework consists of numerous RSU clients and a centralized server. On each RSU client, a scene flow estimation model is deployed and the model is continuously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner. We propose a multi-model self-supervised method that trains the scene flow estimation model by leveraging information from both point cloud and image, where the sequential image data is applied to provide fine-grained supervision on the dynamic status of points.
Besides all RSU clients, a central cloud server coordinates models among all clients. All trained local models on RSU clients are uploaded, aggregated, and combined into a single global model. The global model encapsulates group knowledge and is subsequently distributed back to each client for further refinement. Through multiple rounds of client-server interactions, the resulting global model acquires an enhanced ability to comprehend diverse real-world scenes, a feat that is challenging for a single RSU to accomplish due to its limited perceptible area.
Consequently, our proposed FedRSU can enable more accurate and reliable perception capabilities in intelligent transportation systems, enhancing the effectiveness and security of the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Previous attempts applying federated learning (FL) to ITS have covered various tasks and applications, including perception tasks (e.g., object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, and bird’s eye view segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>), prediction tasks (e.g., steering wheel angle prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and trajectory prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>), and motion control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> or driver monitoring applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. However, previous efforts have serious problems in their designs and frameworks, whereas our proposed FedRSU boasts three distinct advantages over them. 1) The scene flow estimation task is critical and helpful for 3D scene understanding, which directly benefits RSU perception and overall ITS development. 2) We use RSUs as FL clients instead of onboard devices. Onboard devices have limited computing capability and cannot be employed for model training while carrying out real-time inference tasks in complex and dynamic traffic scenarios. 3) Previous works introduce the assumption of client-side ground truth labels, while raw sensor data generated by traffic participants are unable to be annotated due to privacy and data transmission limitations. Consequently, FL with supervised tasks cannot be practically deployed in a real-world ITS.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Previous RSU datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> only contain data from a single scenario and provide 3D bounding box annotation for scene perception.
To validate our scene flow FL framework FedRSU, we propose a large-scale RSU scene flow dataset, RSU-SF. The RSU-SF dataset comprises a total of 31,311 samples collected from 17 RSUs, with each RSU acting as a client in FL. The RSU scenes are derived from three RSU datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and a self-collected dataset, providing a diverse range of scenarios and data heterogeneity.
Data heterogeneity in the RSU-SF dataset arises from various aspects, including the diverse scenarios in which the RSUs are deployed, the different classes and densities of objects in these scenarios, and the varied modalities, sensor parameters, and sensor settings of the RSUs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the RSU-SF dataset, we validate the proposed FedRSU from three aspects:
(1) We conduct experiments under two classical FL settings: generalized FL and personalized FL. For the generalized FL setting, FedRSU improves <math id="S1.p10.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="33.25\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p10.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">33.25</mn><mo id="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p10.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p10.1.m1.1.1.2">33.25</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p10.1.m1.1c">33.25\%</annotation></semantics></math> over local learning in terms of epe3d metric and exhibits robust generalization to new clients not seen in the training data. For the personalized FL setting, FedRSU enhances the performance of each participating RSU client.
(2) The proposed multi-modal scene flow learning method on RSU clients facilitates enhanced performance of scene flow models across diverse experimental settings. Additionally, as more clients have multi-modal data, the overall performance of FedRSU models increases monotonously.
(3) We demonstrate that FedRSU is a general system that can incorporate a wide range of existing self-supervised scene flow methods and FL techniques. We benchmarked an assortment of methods within our FedRSU framework. Specifically, we implement three mainstream self-supervised methods for learning scene flow models at the client side <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Orthogonally, we integrate diverse FL methods, including six generalized FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> and seven personalized FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>.

Therefore, in our method, the denotation <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> can be any frame in the data stream.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For each RSU, it trains a local scene flow estimation model on its locally perceived data.
Considering the impracticality of annotating RSU’s data (which is arduous and time-consuming) and the limitation of scene understanding from a single modality, we propose to train the flow estimation model in a multi-modal recurrent self-supervised manner.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are two key designs in our framework.
1) Recurrent self-supervision: based on the continuously coming sensor data, each RSU is trained to predict the scene flow between two sequential scene frames, thereby constructing supervision from the data itself rather than by human annotating.
Such naturally existent supervision signal enables us to train the scene flow estimation model without any human labeling.
2) Multi-modality: based on the synchronously captured image data from cameras and point cloud data from LiDARs, we propose to leverage them during self-supervised learning. Therefore, these two modalities can complement each other to improve the scene flow estimation.</p>

Learning scene flow estimation without human labeling calls for self-supervised loss designing such that the model can learn from the data itself.
To achieve this, we consider two classical self-supervised loss terms, namely, Chamfer distance loss and smoothness regularization loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
These two terms encourage local model to predict the accurate flow while preserving appropriate local neighbor structures.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">With this predicted point cloud, one basic loss candidate is single-modal Chamfer loss, which enforces the source point cloud to move toward the target point cloud based on point cloud only.
However, despite point cloud can offer rich 3D structural information, it has limitations such as lack of color information, ambiguities in object boundaries, noise and artifacts, which can hinder the accurate prediction of scene flow.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle these limitations, we propose to leverage the image information of the corresponding camera to assist self-supervised learning.
We encode the image information into optical flow, which is utilized to guide the fine-grained Chamfer loss.
In this way, the image data serves to complement the limitations of point cloud data as it provides additional information about color, boundary and mitigates the effects of noise of point cloud.
Note that the optical flow is only used to assist training, leaving the pipeline during inference the same.</p>

Sharing data among RSUs (Central Learning), as the most direct solution, is faced with two critical practical issues:
1) the massive continuously generated data would bring too much burden for communication and memory;
2) recording and sharing data could raise privacy concerns as the raw data usually contains private information.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Addressing this, we propose to a new collaborative learning system FedRSU, which enables collaborative training of scene flow estimation model among multiple RSUs.
Through FedRSU, the final model is essentially the union of knowledge captured by multiple RSUs, breaking the perceptual limits of each individual RSU, thus facilitating more accurate and robust estimation.
Following the conventional procedures of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, the FedRSU consists of four iterative step for each communication round, namely, global model broadcasting, local model training, local model uploading, and global model updating. The overview of the FedRSU system is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III FedRSU: Federated Learning on RSUs ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

Besides, the corresponding camera image can serve as a supplementary aid for model training. In RSU-SF, the temporal interval between two consecutive frames is set to 0.1 seconds (i.e. a sensor sampling frequency of 10 Hz). Furthermore, we remove the ground points of each scene using a height threshold to simplify the scene flow learning. In a real-world RSU scenario, it is easy and straightforward to filter out background points since all sensors are deployed stationarily.</p>

In RSU-SF, these labels are derived from the 3D bounding boxes and tracking labels of scene participants. The method used to generate ground truth is similar to that employed by previous methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Specifically, we extract the rigid transformation of an object from its consecutive bounding box annotations, and then the flow of points within the bounding box can be directly calculated according to the rigid transformation.</p>

To demonstrate the practical impact and effectiveness of our framework in real-world scenarios, the RSU-SF dataset can greatly reflect the diversity of RSUs. We select three base datasets for RSU perception <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and collect another real-world RSU dataset. In total, RSU-SF consists of sensor data collected from 17 RSUs.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">DAIR-V2X <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is a large-scale multi-modality dataset for vehicle-to-infrastructure collaborative perception. The dataset comprises point cloud and image data collected from RSUs located at 7 different intersections. Due to the lack of accuracy in the original dataset labeling, we have relabeled all objects’ 3D bounding boxes and tracking labels for the infrastructure-side data. LUMPI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> is collected using five LiDAR devices deployed at different locations around a single intersection. We consider them as separate RSUs due to their significantly varying perception ranges and resolutions. As the annotations of LUMPI are not yet released, we only use it for training. Specifically, we selected 2,400 frames for training from each RSU. IPS300+ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is a multimodal dataset designed for roadside perception tasks in large-scale urban intersections. The dataset was collected using two intersection perception units equipped with lidar sensors and cameras. Its data is characterized by a high density of objects in the scene, resulting in a high label density and scene complexity. We selected around 3000 frames from the original dataset, out of which 600 frames with complete labels were manually chosen for generating validation and testing pairs.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To increase the scene diversity in our dataset and expand the number of RSUs, we collected additional data from three RSUs on a university campus.
We selected three distinct locations within the campus setting as the sites for data collection. These sites are situated adjacent to buildings and include the pedestrian pathway or parking lot.
Compared to other traffic scenes, the campus scene has a smaller perception range and a higher proportion of pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
The LiDAR and camera sensors were deployed at an angle of 45 degrees and a height of 10 meters. More sensor deployment comparisons can be found in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-A Dataset Collection ‣ IV RSU-SF Dataset ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.

Differently, our self-collected data is obtained from simpler roadside scenarios on campus.
Furthermore, the utilization of different LiDAR devices and various installation methods gives rise to significant disparities in the resolution and perception range of the point cloud data. we can observe that the perception range of the sensors varies from 20m to 280m.</p>

Here, we examine from three properties, including the number of point in each data sample, the average size of flow in each data sample, and the proportion of dynamic point in each data sample.
Note that the first is computed on training split and the last two are computed on validation and test splits.
For sample-level demonstration, we plot the histogram where the x-axis is the interested property and the y-axis is the corresponding number of samples (frequency).
For client-level demonstration, we average the property within each client and show the bar plot, where the x-axis is the client index (same as Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-A Dataset Collection ‣ IV RSU-SF Dataset ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>).</p>

RSU-SF is a practical multi-modal FL dataset with point cloud and image modalities for scene flow estimation task.
Unlike previous works that assume each client has labeled data, our RSU-SF represents more practical scenarios where data is generally unlabeled.
Besides, previous works either emphasize on benchmarking generalized FL or personalized FL, while we simultaneously benchmark generalized and personalized FL.
These properties also make RSU-SF a new and representative test-bed candidate for FL algorithms.</p>

From the table, we see that 1) our proposed multi-modal FL method consistently achieves the lowest epe3d across different evaluation protocols and participation scenarios.
Note that epe3d is the most comprehensive and crucial metric.
Despite this, our method also achieves the highest or comparable accs and accr except when evaluated on seen clients under partial client participation.
2) Considering the generalization performance (evaluation on unseen clients), our proposed multi-modal FL approach even outperforms the central learning on a single modality, showing the advantages of multi-modality on learning generalizable models.
Note that the unseen clients have fewer dynamic points; see Fig. <a href="#S4.F6.sf6" title="In Figure 6 ‣ IV-B Dataset Properties ‣ IV RSU-SF Dataset ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6f</span></a>.
This may indicate that our method can better distinguish static and dynamic points, so that it performs well when switching from training distribution to testing distribution (less dynamic point).</p>

Mean value represents the performance, std represents fairness, and improvement ratio captures the level of incentive.
From the table, considering epe3d, our proposed multi-modal FL approach consistently achieves the lowest error (lowest mean), highest fairness (lowest std), and highest level of incentive (highest improvement ratio).</p>

However, we can see that FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> performs significantly better than FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> while SCAFFOLD performs worse than FedAvg. Such a finding illustrates that there is no universal FL algorithm for handling all tasks and that existing FL algorithms may not be applicable in FedRSU setting, calling for more specific and effective algorithms in this practical scenario.</p>

From the table, we see that the performance generally degrades with the number of multi-modal clients decreases.

This may due to that the patterns in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for vision domain may not be applicable to our model architecture for lidar domain. In vision domain, there is clear evidence that shallow layers in a CNN capture more general patterns and thus may be more shareable in FL settings. However, this may not hold true in lidar domain, which may requires more explanation for future works and is not the focus in this paper. <span id="S5.SS4.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(4)</span> Considering epe3d, pFedMe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> not only achieves the highest utility, but also maintains the highest level of fairness.

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To explore the effects of self-supervised scene flow estimation methods, we consider three representatives: FlowStep3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, PointPWC-Net <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and FlowNet3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. From TABLE <a href="#S5.T8" title="TABLE VIII ‣ V-E Effects of Self-supervised Methods ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a>, we see that FlowStep3D outperforms other scene flow methods in terms of epe3d, but it does not necessarily bring better performance on the other two metrics (e.g. FlowNet3D achieves higher accs). Since the metric of epe3d captures the property of all points, we regard it as a more reliable and comprehensive metric, leading to the conclusion that FlowStep3D is a better scene flow method in our FedRSU framework. We believe that with more advanced self-supervised scene flow estimation methods in the future, the effectiveness of our FedRSU framework will be concurrently enhanced.</p>

Following the setting full client participation setting in Table <a href="#S5.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ V-B Federated Multi-Modal Learning ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, we evaluate the predicted results of three representative methods, including central learning, federated learning (FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>), and local learning. Here, we show the results on a sample in Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-F Visualization of Predicted Flow ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, where black dots denote source point cloud, blue dots denote well-predicted points and red dots denote poorly-predicted points.</p>

<p id="S5.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From the figure, we see that 1) local (individual) learning may result in poor scene flow estimation due to limited perceived data from a single RSU; see a large proportion of red dots on the right of Fig. <a href="#S5.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ V-F Visualization of Predicted Flow ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. 2) Federated learning significantly improves the quality of scene flow estimation; see a large proportion of poorly-predicted red points in local learning have transformed into well-predicted blue points in federated learning (e.g., the two clusters in left of Fig. <a href="#S5.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ V-F Visualization of Predicted Flow ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7b</span></a>). 3) There is still a gap between federated learning and central learning; see better prediction of central learning in the middle top of Fig. <a href="#S5.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ V-F Visualization of Predicted Flow ‣ V Experiments ‣ FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7a</span></a>.

Since in the intelligent transportation system, it is challenging to obtain ground truth annotations at the local (RSU) end, we choose self-supervised scene flow estimation as our target task. The scene flow estimation doesn’t offer a holistic scene representation. It is a low-level task that anticipates the dynamic flow within the scene, making it intricate to distinguish object categories and stationary instances. For practical usage, it typically requires integration with other downstream tasks.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a new practical scenario for intelligent transportation systems (ITS): FedRSU, where multiple roadside units (RSUs) collaboratively train a shared scene flow estimation model using the continuously generated unlabeled point cloud (and camera) data.
In FedRSU, we propose a novel multi-modal FL approach that trains the scene flow estimation model on point cloud under fine-grained guidance from image optical flow.
To verify the performance of FedRSU, we construct a real-world scene flow dataset RSU-SF, which covers diverse scenarios, devices and configurations, promoting the development of FedRSU and FL.
Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark on FedRSU, covering diverse baselines and scenarios, and show the outstanding performance of our proposed multi-modal FL approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We show that FedRSU can remedy the limitation of a single RSU, augmenting ITS with more accurate, wide-range, and reliable perception capabilities.
Our work demonstrates an easy and deployable framework to scale up training datasets to a large extent for model learning in ITS.
Besides, our work presents a new real-world scenario and opens new research directions for the FL community.</p>
