<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Federated learning is gaining popularity as a distributed machine learning method that can be used to deploy AI-dependent IoT applications while protecting client data privacy and security. Due to the differences of clients, a single global model may not perform well on all clients, so the personalized federated learning method, which trains a personalized model for each client that better suits its individual needs, becomes a research hotspot. Most personalized federated learning research, however, focuses on data heterogeneity while ignoring the need for model architecture heterogeneity. Most existing federated learning methods uniformly set the model architecture of all clients participating in federated learning, which is inconvenient for each client’s individual model and local data distribution requirements, and also increases the risk of client model leakage. This paper proposes a federated learning method based on co-training and generative adversarial networks(GANs) that allows each client to design its own model to participate in federated learning training independently without sharing any model architecture or parameter information with other clients or a center. In our experiments, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in mean test accuracy by 42% when the client’s model architecture and data distribution vary significantly.</span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Internet of Things (IoT) devices are growing dramatically. It is estimated that in the next 10 years, the total number of IoT devices will reach hundreds of billions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, and these devices are used in fields such as intelligent transportation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, intelligent industry<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, healthcare and intelligent monitoring<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. These IoT devices generate massive and rapidly growing data, and present attractive opportunities for data-driven artificial intelligence techniques<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Centralized machine learning schemes can be used
for these smart IoT applications. However, centralized machine learning techniques have an inherent problem of leaking user privacy because end-device data needs to be transferred to a centralized third-party server for training. Furthermore, centralized machine learning may not be feasible when the amount of data is very large and located in multiple locations. Although distributed machine learning can solve some problems of centralized machine learning, traditional distributed machine learning methods still lack the protection of data security and privacy of participants.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Federated learning is a distributed machine learning method proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and it can train machine learning models using distributed data stored in different clients while avoiding client data leakage. The clients in the scenario where federated learning was first proposed are various edge devices such as mobile phones<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. The center trains a neural network global model using the data stored in each client device. The center creates the global model architecture, which is shared by all clients. The need for personalized federated learning was then proposed<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, where the needs and data distribution of individual clients are typically quite different. For example, each client needs to train a shopping recommendation model for its customers, and each client’s customer groups are geographically diverse. A global model is difficult to fit all clients due to factors such as different consumer preferences and spending power in different regions, and the data distribution of different clients may also be non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID). As a result, the goal of personalized federated learning is to train a personalized model for each individual client that is more tailored to their specific needs, rather than a single global model that serves all clients.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although many personalized federated learning methods have been proposed, the majority of these methods require all clients’ model architectures to be consistent, and model personalization is reflected in differences in model parameters. <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">However, when the clients participating in federated learning belong to different organizations, the differences in client models are likely not limited to the parameters of the models, but also include different model architectures. Because the machine learning model architectures deployed by different organizations on their client devices are designed for their specific task requirements, the client model architectures of different organizations are typically not the same. We believe that the consistency of the model architecture limits the scope of personalized models. Additionally, sharing the model architecture results in the leakage of the model design, which may be the intellectual property rights of participating organizations. Therefore, if the model architecture is known, maliciously participating clients will be more involved. It is simple to use the model parameters and training process to infer other clients’ private training data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and this invalidates the role of federated learning in protecting client privacy.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The effectiveness of federated learning stems from knowledge sharing among clients, and personalized federated learning aims to share common knowledge among clients while maintaining their personalized knowledge. <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Existing federated learning methods share knowledge via model parameters, and necessitate consistent model architectures, which not only weakens the personality of the client model but also increases the risk of model leakage.</span> This paper proposes a federated learning strategy based on generating adversarial sample sharing to overcome this issue. The proposed strategy allows each client to independently design the neural network model architecture without disclosing it to other clients or the center. The knowledge of each client’s training data does not need to be shared in the form of model parameters, but can be obtained by sharing the samples generated by generated adversarial networks (GANs).

It prevents clients from independently designing unique model architectures. To address this issue, FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed by Li <span id="S2.SS1.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span>, leverages knowledge distillation to convey the knowledge of each client’s local data, by aligning the logits of multiple neural networks on a public dataset. FedMD’s client models can be neural networks of various architectures, as long as they are consistent in the logits output layers. However, FedMD requires a large amount of labeled data as a public dataset for client models alignment. Collecting labeled data is difficult, and open large-scale labeled datasets are usually rare, which limits the application scenarios of FedMD.

The competition is conducted in terms of data distribution.

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The primary motivation for federated learning is to increase client model performance. The reason for the poor performance of the locally trained model is frequently a lack of local data, which prevents the model from learning enough task expertise by training on only the local dataset. As a result, in order to increase the performance of the client models, they must be able to learn from other clients. The most popular and direct ways to communicate knowledge are to share data or models, however these are disallowed in our federated learning environment, <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">therefore we need to develop alternative methods.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The study related co-training shows that, to improve the performance of the classification task model, a large enough diversity between models is required <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. In general, generating models with substantial divergences in single view settings is difficult. In federated learning contexts, however, client models may have quite distinct architectures and be trained on individualized private datasets that are very likely to be <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Non-IID</span>. All of these factors may result in variations in the models of different clients. As a result, our central idea is to use the model trained on each client’s local data as the discriminator network, and to generate fresh samples. Following the receipt of these created datasets, other clients use them to train their local models further, thereby boosting the performance of their tailored models. We give the overall steps of PerFED-GAN as follows and Fig.<a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ IV-A The Overall Steps of PerFED-GAN ‣ IV PerFED-GAN ‣ PerFED-GAN: Personalized Federated Learning via Generative Adversarial Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

For example, there are 3 categories, A, B, and C. Client 1 generates a dataset {A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2}, Client 2 generates a dataset {A3, A4, B3, B4, C3, C4}, and Client 3 generates a dataset {A5, A6, B5, B6, C5, C6}. The central server aggregates these to a large dataset {A1, A2, …, A6, B1, B2,…,B6, C1, C2,…,C6}, and then, the center random selects some samples from the large dataset to send to each client. The in-processing training is to train the client model on its private dataset and the aggregated dataset received from the center. The aggregated dataset received by each client from the center contains generated samples from other clients. These samples and their corresponding labels can be regarded as other clients’ classification result on an unlabeled sample, because the samples are generated by other clients according to the target labels. At this point, in-processing training with the aggregated dataset is equivalent to training with the results of labeling unlabeled data with another classifier in co-training.</span></p>

In theory, any method that can be used to train a neural network can be used as a replacement. Therefore, PerFED-GAN can take advantage of the latest neural network optimization research results to enhance the training effect and hardly need to make more additional changes.</span></p>

The number of uploaded samples can be adjusted according to actual conditions, and more samples can be uploaded when the communication bandwidth is sufficient. In addition, it is also a feasible strategy to directly upload the generation network to the center and generate samples by the center, but it may also bring additional risk of model privacy leakage. In addition, the impact of uploading a generative model or generating samples on the efficiency of training time should also be evaluated according to various factors such as communication capacity, sample size, size of the generative model, and computing resources of the central server.</span></p>

It should be mentioned that, however, during this process, the disparity between the models of different clients will gradually diminish. According to Theorem 1, it results in a reduced model performance improvement until the model no longer improves.</span> Continued training may cause the models of various customers to eventually converge and lose their individualized features, which is counterproductive to the goal of generating a high-performance tailored model.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">PerFED-GAN typically has considerably more than two clients participating in federated learning and training. Our convergence analysis, on the other hand, should be equally applicable. This is due to the fact that, for a given client, all other clients can be viewed as a whole or an ensemble classifier. It is currently equivalent to the two in the preceding theoretical analysis. We can determine the convergence of PerFED-GAN by performing the above study for each client.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p9.1" class="ltx_p">An obvious reason for the PerFED-GAN method is that when the models of different clients are highly diverse, <span id="S4.SS3.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the gap in information possessed by the models will be bigger.</span> As a result, each client model’s information obtained from others contains more unknown knowledge to itself. As a result, more fresh knowledge leads to more significant performance increases. Furthermore, when the mutual learning between several models is significant, the knowledge variety between them almost disappears. At this point, mutual learning is unlikely to give any client with new information.</p>

In the experimental section, we show that the quality of the generated samples can be reduced by limiting the GAN training rounds to reduce the risk of leaking the raw data, and the experiment results show that reducing the GAN training rounds results in a small degradation in model quality.

<p id="S5.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In the CIFAR experiments, we divided the datasets of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively. The divisions are carried out in two ways, i.e., the above-mentioned IID setting and Non-IID setting. In the experiments, for a client, the local training dataset size is 500. Under IID settings, the training sets of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 are randomly and evenly distributed to 100 clients. For Non-IID setting, the training dataset of a client is constructed as follows: randomly select 60% of all categories (6 categories for CIFAR10, 60 categories for CIFAR100), and uniformly random samples from these categories 450 samples, and the remaining 50 samples are randomly selected from the remaining 40% of the samples.</span> The result of this configuration is that each client has a relatively large number of training samples for 60% of the categories, while the number of training samples for the remaining 40% of the categories is insufficient (or even missing). It should be noted that in both IID setting and <span id="S5.SS6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Non-IID</span> setting, since sampling without replacement is used, all clients are ensured that there are no overlapping training samples.</p>

Therefore, in order to test the performance of the personalized model, its test dataset distribution should be similar to that of the training dataset.</span> This means that for a specific client, all test samples cannot be used directly, but some types of test samples are reduced to make the test dataset and <span id="S5.SS6.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">the</span> distribution of the training dataset is consistent.</p>

We find that the PerFED-GAN method improves the test accuracies of client models by 8%-33% in the IID setting with an average of 17.2% for CIFAR10 experiments. It shows that PerFED-GAN can bring significant performance improvement of client models even when the model differences are small. For CIFAR100 experiments, the performances of PerFED-GAN model relative to the local models have been improved by 15%-41% under IID setting, with an average of 24%.</span> This improvement is more obvious than that in the CIFAR10 experiment due to the fact that the number of samples available for training in each category is fewer, so the benefits of federated learning are greater. For the <span id="S5.SS6.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Non-IID</span> data setting, the improvement by PerFED-GAN can be more significant due to the greater diversity among different client models since their training dataset come from different distributions. In our <span id="S5.SS6.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">experiments</span>, the PerFED-GAN achieves a relative improvement in the average test accuracy of 35% for CIFAR10 and 49% for CIFAR100. For each client, the improvement ranges from 14% to 67% for CIFAR10, and 22%-85% for CIFAR100. This result is significantly <span id="S5.SS6.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">better</span> than the IID settings, indicating that PerFED-GAN is less damaged by statistical heterogeneity. Therefore, PerFED-GAN is more suitable for personalized federated learning scenarios where the client tasks are more personalized and the data distribution is more different.</p>

<p id="S5.SS9.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS9.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">From theoretical analysis, it can be known that when the samples generated by GAN are more similar to the training samples, the more accurately the generated samples can express the information of the training samples. As a result, other client models that use these generated samples can learn the information more accurately, which brings more significant performance gains to the federated learning model. However, high-quality generated samples may also cause the leakage of training samples. Avoiding data privacy leakage is the basic premise of federated learning. Therefore, we try to control the quality of generated samples of GANs by training rounds. When the training rounds are insufficient, the qualities of generated samples are lower, which can better protect the privacy of clients’ local data. We investigate whether using these low-quality generated samples with PerFED-GAN can result in sufficient federated learning performance gains.</span></p>

The experimental results show that higher-quality generated samples obtained after more rounds of GAN training can indeed improve PerFED-GAN performance, but even if the GANs obtained from less training rounds are used to generate samples, when the qualities of the samples generated at this time are very low and the risks of privacy leakage are low, they can still achieve better results.

In <span id="S5.SS11.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Non-IID</span> settings, FedAvg and FedProx both need more communication rounds to stabilize to good performance. At this time, PerFED-GAN shows great advantages over other methods in Fig.<a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-K Compare with Other Federated Learning Methods ‣ V Experiments ‣ PerFED-GAN: Personalized Federated Learning via Generative Adversarial Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>(b), leads 12% to the best performance of the comparison methods. Moreover, it achieves the best performance results with fewer communication rounds. <span id="S5.SS11.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In terms of time consumption, the PerFED-GAN method needs to train the GAN and train on the aggregated dataset thus results in more time overhead than the parameter aggregation methods such as FedAvg and FedProx for in-client training. However, supporting personalized federated training of heterogeneous model architectures and better performance for Non-IID scenarios is the most important advantage of the PerFED-GAN algorithm, and it is also the main motivation for this paper.</span></p>

<p id="S5.SS11.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS11.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The results of comparing FedMD with PerFED-GAN are shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ V-K Compare with Other Federated Learning Methods ‣ V Experiments ‣ PerFED-GAN: Personalized Federated Learning via Generative Adversarial Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. In both IID and Non-IID settings, FedMD does not reach the performance of PerFED-GAN. PerFED-GAN leads 21% in IID settings and 42% in Non-IID settings, and in the iterative process, FedMD even experienced performance degradation. Federated distillation algorithm FedMD requires an additional public dataset. In each round, each client needs to train on the public dataset to align the output probability vectors of different client models. Therefore, the additional time consumption mainly depends on the size of the public dataset used for federated distillation. In this set of FedMD experiments, the size of public dataset is 10 times the size of local private dataset. Compared with this, the training of the GAN part in the PerFED-GAN experiments in this paper only needs to be performed on the local dataset. The in-processing training uses 5 times the number of generated samples compared to the local samples, which is lower than the size of the public dataset in FedMD. From the experimental results, the quality of the personalized model of PerFED-GAN is significantly better than that of the federated distillation method FedMD. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that PerFED-GAN does not need to rely on additional datasets. In the federated distillation algorithm, a huge public dataset is necessary, and the dataset needs to be highly related to the task of federated learning. The availability of this public dataset limits the scope of application of federated distillation method.</span></p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In this paper, we propose the PerFED-GAN federated learning method, which is compatible with heterogeneous model architectures. PerFED-GAN is more suitable for personalized federated learning settings with higher heterogeneity and personalized needs than existing methods. Furthermore, PerFED-GAN protects not only the private data of all clients in federated learning settings, but also their private models and training strategies. PerFED-GAN enables clients to share multi-party knowledge to improve the performance of their local models. It produces promising results on Non-IID datasets for heterogeneous models with different architectures, which are more practical but typically difficult to handle in existing federated learning methods.</span></p>
