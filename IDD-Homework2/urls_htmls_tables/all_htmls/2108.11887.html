<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), an emerging and promising field in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Starting with a tutorial of Federated Learning (FL) and RL, we then focus on the introduction of FRL as a new method with great potential by leveraging the basic idea of FL to improve the performance of RL while preserving data-privacy. According to the distribution characteristics of the agents in the framework, FRL algorithms can be divided into two categories, <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., Horizontal Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) and Vertical Federated Reinforcement Learning (VFRL). We provide the detailed definitions of each category by formulas, investigate the evolution of FRL from a technical perspective, and highlight its advantages over previous RL algorithms. In addition, the existing works on FRL are summarized by application fields, including edge computing, communication, control optimization, and attack detection. Finally, we describe and discuss several key research directions that are crucial to solving the open problems within FRL.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As Machine Learning (ML) develops, it becomes capable of solving increasingly complex problems, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and semantic understanding. Despite the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms in several areas, the researchers found that scenes involving many parties are still difficult to resolve, especially when privacy is concerned. Federated Learning (FL), in these cases, has attracted increasing interest among ML researchers. Technically, the FL is a decentralized collaborative approach that allows multiple partners to train data respectively and build a shared model while maintaining privacy. With its innovative learning architecture and concepts, FL provides safer experience exchange services and enhances capabilities of ML in distributed scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In ML, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the branches that focuses on how individuals, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., agents, interact with their environment and maximize some portion of the cumulative reward. The process allows agents to learn to improve their behavior in a trial and error manner. Through a set of policies, they take actions to explore the environment and expect to be rewarded. Research on RL has been hot in recent years, and it has shown great potential in various applications, including games, robotics, communication, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, there are still many problems in the implementation of RL in practical scenarios. For example, considering that in the case of large action space and state space, the performance of agents is vulnerable to collected samples since it is nearly impossible to explore all sampling spaces. In addition, many RL algorithms have the problem of learning efficiency caused by low sample efficiency. Therefore, through information exchange between agents, learning speed can be greatly accelerated. Although distributed RL and parallel RL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> can be used to address the above problems, they usually need to collect all the data, parameters, or gradients from each agent in a central server for model training. However, one of the important issues is that some tasks need to prevent agent information leakage and protect agent privacy during the application of RL. Agents’ distrust of the central server and the risk of eavesdropping on the transmission of raw data has become a major bottleneck for such RL applications. FL can not only complete information exchange while avoiding privacy disclosure, but also adapt various agents to their different environments. Another problem of RL is how to bridge the simulation-reality gap. Many RL algorithms require pre-training in simulated environments as a prerequisite for application deployment, but one problem is that the simulated environments cannot accurately reflect the environments of the real world. FL can aggregate information from both environments and thus bridge the gap between them. Finally, in some cases, only partial features can be observed by each agent in RL. However, these features, no matter observations or rewards, are not enough to obtain sufficient information required to make decisions. At this time, FL makes it possible to integrate this information through aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, the above challenges give rise to the idea of federated reinforcement learning (FRL). As FRL can be considered as an integration of FL and RL under privacy protection, several elements of RL can be presented in FL frameworks to deals with sequential decision-making tasks. For example, these three dimensions of sample, feature and label in FL can be replaced by environment, state and action respectively in FRL. Since FL can be divided into several categories according to the distribution characteristics of data, including Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) and Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), we can similarly categorize FRL algorithms into Horizontal Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) and Vertical Federated Reinforcement Learning (VFRL).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Though a few survey papers on FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> have been published, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently no relevant survey papers focused on FRL. Due to the fact that FRL is a relatively new technique, most researchers may be unfamiliar with it to some extent. We hope to identify achievements from current studies and serve as a stepping stone to further research. In summary, this paper sheds light on the following aspects.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.20" class="ltx_p">In general, FL is a ML algorithmic framework that allows multiple parties to perform ML under the requirements of privacy protection, data security, and regulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In FL architecture, model construction includes two processes: model training and model inference. It is possible to exchange information about the model between parties during training, but not the data itself, so that data privacy will not be compromised in any way. An individual party or multiple parties can possess and maintain the trained model. In the process of model aggregation, more data instances collected from various parties contribute to updating the model. As the last step, a fair value-distribution mechanism should be used to share the profits obtained by the collaborative model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The well-designed mechanism enables the federation sustainability. Aiming to build a joint ML model without sharing local data, FL involves technologies from different research fields such as distributed systems, information communication, ML and cryptography <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Considering that FL is designed to adapt to various scenarios, the objective function may be appropriate depending on the application. However, a closed-form solution is almost impossible to find with most FL models due to their inherent complexity. A canonical federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg) based on gradient-descent techniques is presented in the study from McMahan <span id="S2.SS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which is widely used in FL systems. In general, the coordinator has the initial FL model and is responsible for aggregation. Distributed participants know the optimizer settings and can upload information that does not affect privacy. The specific architecture of FL will be discussed in the next subsection. Each participant uses their local data to perform one step (or multiple steps) of gradient descent on the current model parameter <math id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bar{w}\left(t\right)" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.2" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml">w</mi><mo id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.1" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.1.cmml">¯</mo></mover><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.1" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.3.2" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mo id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2"><times id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.1"></times><apply id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2"><ci id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.1">¯</ci><ci id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.2.2.2">𝑤</ci></apply><ci id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1c">\bar{w}\left(t\right)</annotation></semantics></math> according to the following formula,</p>

The participants are the data owners and can perform local model training and updates. In different scenarios, the participants are made up of different devices, the vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), or the smart devices in the IoT. In addition, participants usually possess at least two characteristics. Firstly, each participant has a certain level of hardware performance, including computation power, communication and storage. The hardware capabilities ensure that the FL algorithm operates normally. Secondly, participants are independent of one another and located in a wide geographic area. In the client-server model, coordinator can be considered as a central aggregation server, which can initialize a model and aggregate model updates from participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. As participants train both based on local data sets concurrently and share their experience through the coordinator with the model aggregation mechanism, it will greatly enhance the efficiency of the training and enhance the performance of the model. However, since participants won’t be able to communicate directly, the coordinator must perform well to train the global model and maintain communication with all participants. Therefore, the model has security challenges such as a single point of failure. If the coordinator fails to complete the model aggregation task, the local model of participant has difficulty meeting target performance. The basic workflow of the client-server model can be summarized in the following five steps. The process continues to repeat the steps from 2 to 5 until the model converges, or until the maximum number of iterations is reached.</p>

Participants can directly communicate with each other without relying on a third party. Therefore, each participant in the architecture is equal and can initiate a model exchange request with anyone else. As there is no central server, participants must agree in advance on the order in which model should be sent and received. Common transfer modes are cyclic transfer and random transfer. The peer-to-peer model is suitable and important for specific scenarios. For example, multiple banks jointly develop an ML-based attack detection model. With FL, there is no need to establish a central authority between banks to manage and store all attack patterns. The attack record is only held at the server of the attacked bank, but the detection experience can be shared with other participants through model parameters. The FL procedure of the peer-to-peer model is simpler than that of the client-server model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.8" class="ltx_p">HFL indicates the case in which participants have their dataset with a small sample overlap, while most of the data features are aligned. The word ”horizontal” is derived from the term ”horizontal partition”. This is similar to the situation where data is horizontally partitioned inside the traditional tabular view of a database. As shown in Figure. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-C Categories of federated learning ‣ II Federated learning ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning: Techniques, Applications, and Open Challenges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the training data of two participants with the aligned features is horizontally partitioned for HFL. A cuboid with a red border represents the training data required in learning. Especially, a row corresponds to complete data features collected from a sampling ID. Columns correspond to different sampling IDs. The overlapping part means there can be more than one participant sampling the same ID. In addition, HFL is also known as feature-aligned FL, sample-partitioned FL, or example-partitioned FL. Formally, the conditions for HFL can be summarized as</p>

The objective of HFL is to increase the amount of data with similar features, while keeping the original data from being transmitted, thus improving the performance of the training model. Participants can still perform feature extraction and classification if new samples appear. HFL can be applied in various fields because it benefits from privacy protection and experience sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. For example, regional hospitals may receive different patients, and the clinical manifestations of patients with the same disease are similar. It is imperative to protect the patient’s privacy, so data about patients cannot be shared. HFL provides a good way to jointly build a ML model for identifying diseases between hospitals.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.7" class="ltx_p">VFL refers to the case where different participants with various targets usually have datasets that have different feature spaces, but those participants may serve a large number of common users. The heterogeneous feature spaces of distributed datasets can be used to build more general and accurate models without releasing the private data. The word “vertical” derives from the term “vertical partition”, which is also widely used in reference to the traditional tabular view. Different from HFL, the training data of each participant are divided vertically. Figure <a href="#S2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ II-C Categories of federated learning ‣ II Federated learning ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning: Techniques, Applications, and Open Challenges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows an example of VFL in a two-party scenario. The important step in VFL is to align samples, <span id="S2.SS3.p3.7.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S2.SS3.p3.7.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., determine which samples are common to the participants. Although the features of the data are different, the sampled identity can be verified with the same ID. Therefore, VFL is also called sample-aligned FL or feature-partitioned FL. Multiple features are vertically divided into one or more columns. The common samples exposed to different participants can be marked by different labels. The formal definition of VFL’s applicable scenario is given.</p>

It is the objective of VFL to collaborate in building a shared ML model by exploiting all features collected by each participant. The fusion and analysis of existing features can even infer new features. An example of the application of VFL is the evaluation of trust. Banks and e-commerce companies can create a ML model for trust evaluation for users. The credit card record held at the bank and the purchasing history held at the e-commerce company for the set of same users can be used as training data to improve the evaluation model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p4.3" class="ltx_p">FTL applies to a more general case where the datasets of participants are not aligned with each other in terms of samples or features. FTL involves finding the invariant between a resource-rich source domain and a resource-scarce target domain, and exploiting that invariant to transfer knowledge. In comparison with traditional transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, FTL focuses on privacy-preserving issues and addresses distributed challenges. An example of FTL is shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ II-C Categories of federated learning ‣ II Federated learning ‣ Federated Reinforcement Learning: Techniques, Applications, and Open Challenges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The training data required by FTL may include all data owned by multiply parties for comprehensive information extraction. In order to predict labels for unlabeled new samples, a prediction model is built using additional feature representations for mixed samples from participants A and B. More formally, FTL is applicable for the following scenarios:</p>

The objective of FTL is to generate as accurate a label prediction as possible for newly incoming samples or unlabeled samples already present. Another benefit of FTL is that it is capable of overcoming the absence of data or labels. For example, a bank and an e-commerce company in two different countries want to build a shared ML model for user risk assessment. In light of geographical restrictions, the user groups of these two organizations have limited overlap. Due to the fact that businesses are different, only a small number of data features are the same. It is important in this case to introduce FTL to solve the problem of small unilateral data and fewer sample labels, and improve the model performance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">Q-learning is a typical widely-used value-based RL algorithm. It is also a model-free algorithm, which means that it does not need to know the model of the environment but directly estimates the Q value of each executed action in each encountered state through interacting with the environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Then, the optimal strategy is formulated by selecting the action with the highest Q value in each state. This strategy maximizes the expected return for all subsequent actions from the current state. The most important part of Q-learning is the update of Q value.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">REINFORCE algorithm is a classic policy gradient algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Since the expected value of the cumulative reward cannot be calculated directly, the Monte Carlo method is applied to approximate the average value of multiple samples. REINFORCE updates the unbiased estimate of the gradient by using Monte Carlo sampling. Each sampling generates a trajectory, which runs iteratively. After obtaining a large number of trajectories, the cumulative reward can be calculated by using certain transformations and approximations as the loss function for gradient update. However, the variance of this algorithm is large since it needs to interact with the environment until the terminate state. The reward for each interaction is a random variable, so each variance will add up when the variance is calculated.
In particular, the REINFORCE algorithm has three steps:</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The two algorithms, value-based and policy-based methods, both have their own characteristics and disadvantages. Firstly, the disadvantages of the value-based methods are that the output of the action cannot be obtained directly, and it is difficult to extend to the continuous action space. The value-based methods can also lead to the problem of high bias, <span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., it is difficult to eliminate the error between the estimated value function and the actual value function. For the policy-based methods, a large number of trajectories must be sampled, and the difference between each trajectory may be huge. As a result, high variance and large gradient noise are introduced. It leads to the instability of training and the difficulty of policy convergence.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The actor-critic architecture combines the characteristics of the value-based and policy-based algorithms, and to a certain extent solves their respective weaknesses, as well as the contradictions between high variance and high bias. The constructed agent can not only directly output policies, but also evaluate the performance of the current policies through the value function. Specifically, the actor-critic architecture consists of an actor which is responsible for generating the policy and a critic to evaluate this policy. When the actor is performing, the critic should evaluate its performance, both of which are constantly being updated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.

The big issue with Q-learning falls into the tabular method, which means that when state and action spaces are very large, it cannot build a very large Q table to store a large number of Q values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Besides, it counts and iterates Q values based on past states. Therefore, on the one hand, the applicable state and action space of Q-learning is very small. On the other hand, if a state never appears, Q-learning cannot deal with it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the excellent performance that RL and DRL have achieved in many areas, they still face several important technical and non-technical challenges in solving real-world problems. The successful application of FL in supervised learning tasks arouses interest in exploiting similar ideas in RL, <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., FRL. On the other hand, although FL is useful in some specific situations, it fails to deal with cooperative control and optimal decision-making in dynamic environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. FRL not only provides the experience for agents to learn to make good decisions in an unknown environment, but also ensures that the privately collected data during the agent’s exploration does not have to be shared with others. A forward-looking and interesting research direction is how to conduct RL under the premise of protecting privacy. Therefore, it is proposed to use FL framework to enhance the security of RL and define FRL as a security-enhanced distributed RL framework to accelerate the learning process, protect agent privacy and handle Not Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Apart from improving the security and privacy of RL, we believe that FRL has a wider and larger potential in helping RL to achieve better performance in various aspects, which will be elaborated in the following subsections.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to facilitate understanding and maintain consistency with FL, FRL is divided into two categories depending on environment partition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., HFRL and VFRL.

In HFRL, the environment that each agent interacts with is independent of the others, while the state space and action space of different agents are aligned to solve similar problems. The action of each agent only affects its own environment and results in corresponding rewards. As an agent can hardly explore all states of its environment, multiple agents interacting with their own copy of the environment can accelerate training and improve model performance by sharing experience. Therefore, horizontal agents use server-client model or peer-to-peer model to transmit and exchange the gradients or parameters of their policy models (actors) and/or value function models (critics). In VFRL, multiple agents interact with the same global environment, but each can only observe limited state information in the scope of its view. Agents can perform different actions depending on the observed environment and receive local reward or even no reward. Based on the actual scenario, there may be some observation overlap between agents. In addition, all agents’ actions affect the global environment dynamics and total rewards. As opposed to the horizontal arrangement of independent environments in HFRL, the vertical arrangement of observations in VFRL poses a more complex problem and is less studied in the existing literature.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">HFRL can be applied in scenarios in which the agents may be distributed geographically, but they face similar decision-making tasks and have very little interaction with each other in the observed environments. Each participating agent independently executes decision-making actions based on the current state of environment and obtains positive or negative rewards for evaluation. Since the environment explored by one agent is limited and each agent is unwilling to share the collected data, multiple agents try to train the policy and/or value model together to improve model performance and increase learning efficiency. The purpose of HFRL is to alleviate the sample-efficiency problem in RL, and help each agent quickly obtain the optimal policy which can maximize the expected cumulative reward for specific tasks, while considering privacy protection.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">A typical example of HFRL is the autonomous driving system in IoV. As vehicles drive on roads throughout the city and country, they can collect various environmental information and train the autonomous driving models locally. Due to driving regulations, weather conditions, driving routes, and other factors, one vehicle cannot be exposed to every possible situation in the environment. Moreover, the vehicles have basically the same operations, including braking, acceleration, steering, <span id="S4.SS2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc</span>. Therefore, vehicles driving on different roads, different cities, or even different countries could share their learned experience with each other by FRL without revealing their driving data according to the premise of privacy protection. In this case, even if other vehicles have never encountered a situation, they can still perform the best action by using the shared model. The exploration of multiple vehicles together also creates an increased chance of learning rare cases to ensure the reliability of the model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Following the above architecture and process, applications suitable for HFRL should meet the following characteristics. First, agents have similar tasks to make decisions under dynamic environments. Different from the FL setting, the goal of the HFRL-based application is to find the optimal strategy to maximize reward in the future. For the agent to accomplish the task requirements, the optimal strategy directs them to perform certain actions, such as control, scheduling, navigation, <span id="S4.SS2.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc</span>. Second, distributed agents maintain independent observations. Each agent can only observe the environment within its field of view, but does not ensure that the collected data follows the same distribution. Third, it is important to protect the data that each agent collects and explores. Agents are presumed to be honest but curious, <span id="S4.SS2.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S4.SS2.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., they honestly follow the learning mechanism but are curious about private information held by other agents. Due to this, the data used for training is only stored at the owner and is not transferred to the coordinator. HFRL provides an implementation method for sharing experiences under the constraints of privacy protection. Additionally, various reasons limit the agent’s ability to explore the environment in a balanced manner. Participating agents may include heterogeneous devices. The amount of data collected by each agent is unbalanced due to mobility, observation, energy and other factors. However, all participants have sufficient computing, storage, and communication capabilities. These capabilities assist the agent in completing model training, merging, and other basic processes. Finally, the environment observed by a agent may change dynamically, causing differences in data distribution. The participating agents need to update the model in time to quickly adapt to environmental changes and construct a personalized local model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In existing RL studies, some applications that meet the above characteristics can be classified as HFRL. Nadiger <span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> presents a typical HFRL architecture, which includes the grouping policy, the learning policy, and the federation policy. In this work, RL is used to show the applicability of granular personalization and FL is used to reduce training time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, a non-player character in the Atari game Pong is implemented and evaluated. In the study from Liu <span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, the authors propose the Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning (LFRL) for navigation in cloud robotic systems. It enables the robot to learn efficiently in a new environment and use prior knowledge to quickly adapt to the changes in the environment. Each robot trains a local model according to its own navigation task, and the centralized cloud server implements a knowledge fusion algorithm for upgrading a shared model. In considering that the local model and the shared model might have different network structures, this paper proposes to apply transfer learning to improve the performance and efficiency of the shared model. Further, researchers also focus on HFRL-based applications in the IoT due to the high demand for privacy protection. Ren <span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> suggest deploying the FL architecture between edge nodes and IoT devices for computation offloading tasks. IoT devices can download RL model from edge nodes and train the local model using own data, including the remained energy resources and the workload of IoT device, <span id="S4.SS2.p9.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc</span>. The edge node aggregates the updated private model into the shared model. Although this method considers privacy protection issues, it requires further evaluation regarding the cost of communication resources by the model exchange. In addition, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> proposes a federated deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework (FADE) for edge caching. Edge devices, including Base Stations (BSs), can cooperatively learn a predictive model using the first round of training parameters for local learning, and then upload the local parameters tuned to the next round of global training. By keeping the training on local devices, the FADE can enable fast training and decouple the learning process between the cloud and data owner in a distributed-centralized manner. More HFRL-based applications will be classified and summarized in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Prior to HFRL, a variety of distributed RL algorithms have been extensively investigated, which are closely related to HFRL. In general, distributed RL algorithms can be divided into two types: synchronized and asynchronous. In synchronous RL algorithms, such as Sync-Opt Synchronous Stochastic Optimization (Sync-Opt) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> and Parallel Advantage Actor Critic (PAAC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the agents explore their own environments separately, and after a number of samples are collected, the global parameters are updated synchronously. On the contrary, the coordinator will update the global model immediately after receiving the gradient from an arbitrary agent in asynchronous RL algorithms, rather than waiting for other agents. Several asynchronous RL algorithms are presented, including A3C <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, Impala <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>, Ape-X <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> and General Reinforcement Learning Architecture (Gorila) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. From the perspective of technology development, HFRL can also be considered security-enhanced parallel RL. In parallel RL, multiple agents interact with a stochastic environment to seek the optimal policy for the same task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. By building a closed loop of data and knowledge in parallel systems, parallel RL helps determine the next course of action for each agent. The state and action representations are fed into a designed neural network to approximate the action value function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>. However, parallel RL typically transfers the experience of agent without considering privacy protection issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In the implementation of HFRL, further restrictions accompany privacy protection and communication consumption to adapt to special scenarios, such as IoT applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>. In addition, another point to consider is Non-IID data. In order to ensure convergence of the RL model, it is generally assumed in parallel RL that the states transitions in the environment follow the same distribution, <span id="S4.SS2.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S4.SS2.p10.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., the environments of different agents are IID. But in actual scenarios, the situation faced by agents may differ slightly, so that the models of environments for different agents are not identically distributed. Therefore, HFRL needs to improve the generalization ability of the model compared with parallel RL to meet the challenges posed by Non-IID data.</p>

Considering the differences in the environment dynamics for the different agents, the assumption of IID data may be broken. Under the HFRL architecture, agents in not identically-distributed environment models can still cooperate to learn a federated model. In order to address the difference in environment dynamics, a personalized update algorithm of local model could be designed to minimize the impact of this issue.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In VFL, samples of multiple data sets have different feature spaces but these samples may belong to the same groups or common users. The training data of each participant are divided vertically according to their features. More general and accurate models can be generated by building heterogeneous feature spaces without releasing private information. VFRL applies the methodology of VFL to RL and is suitable for POMDP scenarios where different RL agents are in the same environment but have different interactions with the environment. Specifically, different agents could have different observations that are only part of the global state. They could take actions from different action spaces and observe different rewards, or some agents even take no actions or cannot observe any rewards. Since the observation range of a single agent to the environment is limited, multiple agents cooperate to collect enough knowledge needed for decision making. The role of FL in VFRL is to aggregate the partial features observed by various agents. Especially for those agents without rewards, the aggregation effect of FL greatly enhances the value of such agents in their interactions with the environment, and ultimately helps with the strategy optimization. It is worth noting that in VFRL the issue of privacy protection needs to be considered, <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., private data collected by some agents do not have to be shared with others. Instead, agents can transmit encrypted model parameters, gradients, or direct mid-product to each other. In short, the goal of VFRL is for agents interacting with the same environment to improve the performance of their policies and the effectiveness in learning them by sharing experiences without compromising the privacy.</p>

The dataset and feature space in VFL are converted to the environment and state space respectively. VFL divides the dataset vertically according to the features of samples, and VFRL divides agents based on the state spaces observed from the global environment. Generally speaking, every agent has its local state which can be different from that of the other agents and the aggregation of these local partial states corresponds to the entire environment state <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite>. In addition, after interacting with the environment, agents may generate their local actions which correspond to the labels in VFL.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p">As an example of VFRL, consider a microgrid (MG) system including household users, the power company, and the photovoltaic (PV) management company as the agents. All the agents observe the same MG environment while their local state spaces are quite different. The global states of the MG system generally consist of several dimensions/features, <span id="S4.SS3.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S4.SS3.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., State-of-Charge (SOC) of the batteries, load consumption of the household users, power generation from PV, etc. The household agents can obtain the SOC of their own batteries and their own load consumption, the power company can know the load consumption of all the users, and PV management company can know the power generation of PV. As to the action, the power company needs to make decisions on the power dispatch of the diesel generators (DG), and the household users can make decisions to manage their electrical utilities with demand response. Finally, the power company can observe rewards such as the cost of DG power generation, the balance between power generation and consumption, and the household users can observe rewards such as their electricity bill that is related to their power consumption. In order to learn the optimal policies, these agents need to communicate with each other to share their observations. However, PV managers do not want to expose their data to other companies, and household users also want to keep their consumption data private. In this way, VFRL is suitable to achieve this goal and can help improve policy decisions without exposing specific data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p9.3" class="ltx_p">Compared with HFRL, there are currently few works on VFRL. Zhuo <span id="S4.SS3.p9.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> present the federated deep reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework. The purpose of this paper is to solve the challenge where the feature space of states is small and the training data are limited. Transfer learning approaches in DRL are also solutions for this case. However, when considering the privacy-aware applications, directly transferring data or models should not be used. Hence, FedRL combines the advantage of FL with RL, which is suitable for the case when agents need to consider their privacy. FedRL framework assumes agents cannot share their partial observations of the environment and some agents are unable to receive rewards.

<p id="S4.SS3.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-agent RL (MARL) is very closely related to VFRL. As the name implies, MARL takes into account the existence of multiple agents in the RL system. However, the empirical evaluation shows that applying the simple single-agent RL algorithms directly to scenarios of multiple agents cannot converge to the optimal solution, since the environment is no longer static from the perspective of each agent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>.

Besides, the actions performed by one certain agent will yield different rewards depending on the actions taken by other agents. This means that agents in MARL correlate with each other, rather than being independent of each other.

However, it should be noted that FRS focuses on reward shaping, this algorithm cannot be used when there is no reward in some agents in VFRL. In addition, FRS performs knowledge aggregation by sharing high-level information such as reward shaping value or embedding between client and server instead of sharing experience or policy directly.

The edge node continuously receives tasks from serviced IoT devices and stores those tasks in a queue.

In case the edge host does not have enough available resources for the task, the task can be offloaded to the server. Contrary to the definition of the central server in the basic FRL, the aim of central server in CFRL is to complete the tasks that the edge nodes cannot handle instead of aggregating local models. Therefore, the server needs to train a special resource allocation model based on its own resource status, forwarded tasks and unique rewards. The main idea of CFRL is that edge nodes and the server cooperatively participate in all task processing in order to reduce total computing time and provide a degree of privacy protection.</p>

A DRL approach is used to map Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) into networks with local knowledge of resources and instantiation cost. In addition, the authors also propose a loss-weight-based mechanism for generation and exploitation of reference samples for training in replay buffers, avoiding the strong relevance of each sample.

<div id="S5.SS6.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The existing FRL literature usually uses classical DRL algorithms, such as DQN and DDPG, at the participants, while the gradients or parameters of the critic and/or actor networks are periodically reported synchronously or asynchronously by the participants to the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the parameters or gradients and sends the updated values to the participants. In order to meet the challenges presented by different scenarios, the aggregation algorithms have been designed as a key feature of FRL. In the original FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the number of samples in a participant’s dataset determines its influence on the global model. In accordance with this idea, several papers propose different methods to calculate the weights in the aggregation algorithms according to the requirement of application. In the study from Lim <span id="S5.SS6.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib106" title="" class="ltx_ref">106</a>]</cite>, the aggregation weight is derived from the average of the cumulative rewards of the last ten episodes. Greater weights are placed on the models of those participants with higher rewards. In contrast to the positive correlation of reward, Huang <span id="S5.SS6.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite> takes the error rate of action as an essential factor to assign weights for participating in the global model training. In D2D -assisted edge caching, Wang <span id="S5.SS6.SSS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite> uses the reward and some device-related indicators as the measurement to evaluate the local model’s contribution to the global model. Moreover, the existing FRL methods based on offline DRL algorithms, such DQN and DDPG, usually use experience replay. Sampling random batch from replay memory can break correlations of continuous transition tuples and accelerate the training process. To arrive at an accurate evaluation of the participants, the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">102</a>]</cite> calculates the aggregation weight based on the size of the training batch in each iteration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS6.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The above aggregation methods can effectively deal with the issue of data imbalance and performance discrepancy between participants, but it is hard for participants to cope with subtle environmental differences. According to the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib105" title="" class="ltx_ref">105</a>]</cite>, as soon as a participant reaches the predefined criteria in its own environment, it should stop learning and send its model parameters as a reference to the remaining individuals. Exchanging mature network models (satisfying terminal conditions) can help other participants complete their training quickly. Participants in other similar environments can continue to use FRL for further updating their parameters to achieve the desired model performance according to their individual environments. Liu <span id="S5.SS6.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> also suggests that the sharing global model in the cloud is not the final policy model for local participants. An effective transfer learning should be applied to resolve the structural difference between the shared network and private network.</p>

<div id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In most of the literature on FRL, FL is used to improve the performance of RL. With FL, the learning experience can be shared among decentralized multiple parties while ensuring privacy and scalability without requiring direct data offloading to servers or third parties. Therefore, FL can expand the scope and enhance the security of RL. Among the applications of FRL, most researchers focus on the communication network system due to its robust security requirements, advanced distributed architecture, and a variety of decision-making tasks. Data offloading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>]</cite> and caching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite> solutions powered by distributed AI are available from FRL. In addition, with the ability to detect a wide range of attacks and support defense solutions, FRL has emerged as a strong alternative for performing distributed learning for security-sensitive scenarios. Enabled by the privacy-enhancing and cooperative features, detection and defense solutions can be learned quickly where multiple participants join to build a federated model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">107</a>, <a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>. FRL can also provide viable solutions to realize intelligence for control systems with many applied domains such as robotics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> and autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib104" title="" class="ltx_ref">104</a>]</cite> without data exchange and privacy leakage. The data owners (robot or vehicle) may not trust the third-party server and therefore hesitate to upload their private information to potentially insecure learning systems. Each participant of FRL runs a separate RL model for determining its own control policy and gains experience by sharing model parameters, gradients or losses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, RL may have the potential to optimize FL schemes and improve the efficiency of training. Due to the unstable network connectivity, it is not practical for FL to update and aggregate models simultaneously across all participants. Therefore, Wang <span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite> proposes a RL-based control framework that intelligently chooses the participants to participate in each round of FL with the aim to speed up convergence. Similarly, Zhang <span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>]</cite> applies RL to pre-select a set of candidate edge participants, and then determine reliable edge participants through social attribute perception. In IoT or IoV scenarios, due to the heterogeneous nature of participating devices, different computing and communication resources are available to them. RL can speed up training by coordinating the allocation of resources between participants. Zhan <span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>]</cite> defines the L4L (Learning for Learning) concept, <span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., use RL to improve FL. Using the heterogeneity of participants and dynamic network connections, this paper investigates a computational resource control problem for FL that simultaneously considers learning time and energy efficiency. An experience-driven resource control approach based on RL is presented to derive the near-optimal strategy with only the participants’ bandwidth information in the previous training rounds. In addition, as with any other ML algorithm, FL algorithms are vulnerable to malicious attacks. RL has been studied to defend against attacks in various scenarios, and it can also enhance the security of FL. The paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite> proposes a reputation-aware RL (RA-RL) based selection method to ensure that FL is not disrupted. The participating devices’ attributes, including computing resources and trust values, <span id="S5.SS6.SSS2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">etc</span>, are used as part of the environment in RL. In the aggregation of the global model, devices with high reputation levels will have a greater chance of being considered to reduce the effects of malicious devices mixed into FL.</p>

<div id="S5.SS6.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed above, FRL can be divided into two main categories, <span id="S5.SS6.SSS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S5.SS6.SSS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., HFRL and VFRL. Currently, most of the existing research is focused on HFRL, while little attention is devoted to VFRL. The reason for this is that HFRL has obvious application scenarios, where multiple participants have similar decision-making tasks with individual environments, such as caching allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>, offloading optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, and attack monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite>. The participants and coordinator only need to train a similar model with the same state and action spaces. Consequently, the algorithm design can be implemented and the training convergence can be verified relatively easily. On the other hand, even though VFRL has a higher degree of technical difficulty at the algorithm design level, it also has a wide range of possible applications. In a multi-agent scenario, for example, a single agent is limited by its ability to observe only part of the environment, whereas the transition of the environment is determined by the behavior of all the agents. Zhuo <span id="S5.SS6.SSS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> assumes agents cannot share their partial observations of the environment and some agents are unable to receive rewards. The federated Q-network aggregation algorithm between two agents is proposed for VFRL. The paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite> specifically applies both HFRL and VFRL for radio access network slicing. For the same type of services, similar data samples are trained locally at participating devices, and BSs perform horizontal aggregation to integrate a cooperative access model by adopting an iterative approach. The terminal device also can optimize the selection of base stations and network slices based on the global model of VFRL, which aggregates access features generated by different types of services on the third encrypted party. The method improves the device’s ability to select the appropriate access points when initiating different types of service requests under restrictions regarding privacy protection. The feasible implementation of VFRL also provides guidance for future research.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we presented in the previous section, FRL serves an increasingly important role as an enabler of various applications. While the FRL-based approach possesses many advantages, there are a number of critical open issues to consider for future implementation. Therefore, this section focuses on several key challenges, including those inherited from FL such as security and communication issues, as well as those unique to FRL. Research on tackling these issues offers interesting directions for the future.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S6.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In realistic HFRL scenarios, while the agents perform similar tasks, the inherent dynamics for the different environments in which the agents reside are usually not exactly identically distributed. The slight difference in the stochastic properties of the transition models for multiple agents could cause the learning convergence issue. One possible method to address this problem is by adjusting the frequency of global aggregation, i.e., after each global aggregation, a period of time is left for each agent to fine-tune its local parameters according to its own environment. Apart from the non-identical environment problem, another interesting and important problem is how to leverage FL to make RL algorithms converge better and faster. It is well-known that DRL algorithms could be unstable and diverge, especially when off-policy training is combined with function approximation and bootstrapping. In FRL, the training curves of some agents could diverge while others converge although the agents are trained in the exact replicas of the same environment. By leveraging FL, it is envisioned that we could expedite the training process as well as increase the stability. For example, we could selectively aggregate the parameters of a subset of agents with a larger potential for convergence, and later transfer the converged parameters to all the agents. To tackle the above problems, several possible solutions proposed for FL algorithm contains certain reference significance. For example, server operators could account for heterogeneity inherent in partial information by adding a proximal term <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite>. The local updates submitted by agents are constrained by the tunable term and have a different effect on the global parameters. In addition, a probabilistic agent selection scheme can be implemented to select the agents whose local FL models have significant effects on the global model to minimize the FL convergence time and the FL training loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite>. Another problem is theoretical analysis of the convergence bounds. Although some existing studies have been directed at this problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite>, the convergence can be guaranteed since the loss function is convex. How to analyze and evaluate the non-convex loss functions in HFRL is also an important research topic in the future.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In most existing works, all the RL agents have the ability to take part in full interaction with the environment and can generate their own actions and rewards. Even though some MARL agents may not participate in the policy decision, they still generate their own reward for evaluation. In some scenarios, special agents in VFRL take the role of providing assistance to other agents. They can only observe the environment and pass on the knowledge of their observation, so as to help other agents make more effective decisions. Therefore, such agents do not have their own actions and rewards. The traditional RL models cannot effectively deal with this thorny problem. Many algorithms either directly use the states of such agents as public knowledge in the system model or design corresponding action and reward for such agents, which may be only for convenience of calculation and have no practical significance. These approaches cannot fundamentally overcome the challenge, especially when privacy protection is also an essential objective to be complied with. Although the FedRL algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> is proposed to deal with the above problem, which has demonstrated good performance, there are still some limitations. First of all, the number of agents used in experiments and algorithms is limited to two, which means the scalability of this algorithm is not high and VFRL algorithms for a large number of agents need to be designed. Secondly, this algorithm uses Q-network as the federated model, which is a relatively simple algorithm. Therefore, how to design VFRL models based on other more complex and changeable networks remains an open issue.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S6.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FRL, the agents need to exchange the model parameters, gradients, intermediate results, etc., between themselves or with a central server. Due to the limited communication resources and battery capacity, the communication cost is an important consideration when implementing these applications. With an increased number of participants, the coordinator has to bear more network workload within the client-server FRL model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>]</cite>. This is because each participant needs to upload and download model updates through the coordinator. Although the distributed peer-to-peer model does not require a central coordinator, each agent may have to exchange information with other participants more frequently. In current research for distributed models, there are no effective model exchange protocols to determine when to share experiences with which agents. In addition, DRL involves updating parameters in deep neural networks. Several popular DRL algorithms, such as DQN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite> and DDPG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite>, consist of multiple layers or multiple networks. Model updates contain millions of parameters, which isn’t feasible for scenarios with limited communication resources. The research directions for the above issues can be divided into three categories. First, it is necessary to design a dynamic update mechanism for participants to optimize the number of model exchanges. A second research direction is to use model compression algorithms to reduce the amount of communication data. Finally, aggregation algorithms that allow participants to only submit the important parts of local model should be studied further.</p>

<div id="S6.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL provides privacy protection that allows the agents to exchange information in a secure manner during the learning process, it still has several privacy and security vulnerabilities associated with communication and attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite>. As FRL is implemented based on FL algorithms, these problems also exist in FRL in the same or variant form. It is important to note that the data poisoning attack is a different attack mode between FL and FRL. In the existing classification tasks of FL, each piece of training data in the dataset corresponds to a respective label. The attacker flips the labels on training examples in one category onto another while the features of the examples are kept unchanged, misguiding the establishment of a target model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>]</cite>. However, in the decision-making task of FRL, the training data is continuously generated from the interaction between the agent and the environment. As a result, the data poisoning attack is implemented in another way. For example, the malicious agent tampers with the reward, which causes the evaluative function to shift. An option is to conduct regular safety assessments for all participants. Participants whose evaluation indicator falls below the threshold are punished to reduce the impact on the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite>. Apart form the insider attacks which are launched by the agents in the FRL system, there may be various outsider attacks which are launched by intruders or eavesdroppers. Intruders may hide in the environment where the agent is and manipulate the transitions of environment to achieve specific goals. In addition, by listening to the communication between the coordinator and the agent, the eavesdropper may infer sensitive information from exchanging parameters and gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib126" title="" class="ltx_ref">126</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the development of technology that detects and protects against attacks and privacy threats does have great potential and is urgently needed.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S6.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One overlooked aspect of FRL-based research is the join and exit process of participants. In practice, the management of participants is essential to the normal progression of cooperation. As mentioned earlier in the security issue, the penetration of malicious participants severely impacts the performance of the cooperative model and the speed of training. The joining mechanism provides participants with the legal status to engage in federated cooperation. It is the first line of defense against malicious attackers. In contrast, the exit mechanism signifies the cancellation of the permission for cooperation. Participant-driven or enforced exit mechanisms are both possible. In particular, for synchronous algorithms, ignoring the exit mechanism can negatively impact learning efficiency. This is because the coordinator needs to wait for all participants to submit their information. In the event that any participant is offline or compromised and unable to upload, the time for one round of training will be increased indefinitely. To address the bottleneck, a few studies consider updating the global model using the selected models from a subset of participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>, <a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive consideration of the exit mechanism, and the communication of participants is typically assumed to be reliable. Therefore, research gaps of FRL still exist in joining and exiting mechanisms. It is expected that the coordinator or monitoring system, upon discovering a failure, disconnection, or malicious participant, will use the exit mechanism to reduce its impact on the global model or even eliminate it.</p>

<div id="S6.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For most studies, the agents taking part in the FRL process are assumed to be honest and voluntary. Each agent provides assistance for the establishment of the cooperation model following the rules and freely shares the masked experience through encrypted parameters or gradients. An agent’s motivation for participation may come from regulation or incentive mechanisms. The FRL process within an organization is usually governed by regulations. For example, BSs belonging to the same company establish a joint model for offloading and caching. Nevertheless, because participants may be members of different organizations or use disparate equipment, it is difficult for regulation to force all parties to share information learned from their own data in the same manner. If there are no regulatory measures, participants prone to selfish behavior will only benefit from the cooperation model but not submit local updates. Therefore, the cooperation of multiple parties, organizations, or individuals requires a fair and efficient incentive mechanism to encourage their active participation. In this way, agents providing more contributions can benefit more and selfish agents unwilling to share there learning experience will receive less benefit. As an example, Google Keyboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>]</cite> users can choose whether or not to allow Google to use their data, but if they do, they can benefit from more accurate word prediction. Although an incentive mechanism in a context-aware manner among data owners is proposed in the study from Yu <span id="S6.SS6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib129" title="" class="ltx_ref">129</a>]</cite>, it is not suitable for the RL problems. There is still no clear plan of action regarding how the FRL-based application can be designed to create a reasonable incentive mechanism for inspiring agents to participate in collaborative learning. To be successful, future research needs to propose a quantitative standard for evaluating the contribution of agents in FRL.</p>

A distributed model can not only eliminate the single point of failure, but it can also improve energy efficiency significantly by allowing models to be exchanged directly between two agents. In a typical application, two adjacent cars share experience learned from road condition environment in the form of models with D2D communications to assist autonomous driving. However, the distributed cooperation increases the complexity of the learning system and imposes stricter requirements for application scenarios. This research should include, but not be limited to, the agent selection method for the exchange model, the mechanism for triggering the model exchange, the improvement of algorithm adaptability, and the convergence analysis of the aggregation algorithm.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a new and potential branch of RL, FL can make learning safer and more efficient while leveraging the benefits of FL. We have discussed the basic definitions of FL and RL as well as our thoughts on their integration in this paper. In general, FRL algorithms can be classified into two categories, <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i</span>.<span id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>., HFRL and VFRL. Thus, the definition and general framework of these two categories have been given. Specifically, we have highlighted the difference between HFRL and VFRL. Then, a lot of existing FRL schemes have been summarized and analyzed according to different applications. Finally, the potential challenges in the development of FRL algorithms have been explored. Several open issues of FRL have been identified, which will encourage more efforts toward further research in FRL.</p>
