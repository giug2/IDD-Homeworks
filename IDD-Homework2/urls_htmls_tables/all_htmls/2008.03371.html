<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm with enhanced privacy. Its primary goal is learning a global model that offers good performance for the participants as many as possible.
The technology is rapidly advancing with many unsolved challenges, among which <span id="id8.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">statistical heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID)</span> and <span id="id8.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">communication efficiency</span> are two critical ones that hinder the development of federated learning.
In this work, we propose LotteryFL – a personalized and communication-efficient federated learning framework via exploiting the Lottery Ticket hypothesis.
In LotteryFL, each client learns a lottery ticket network (i.e., a subnetwork of the base model) by applying the Lottery Ticket hypothesis, and only these lottery networks will be communicated between the server and clients.
Rather than learning a shared global model in classic federated learning, each client learns a personalized model via LotteryFL;
the communication cost can be significantly reduced due to the compact size of lottery networks.
To support the training and evaluation of our framework, we construct non-IID datasets based on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and EMNIST by taking <span id="id8.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">feature distribution skew</span>, <span id="id8.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">label distribution skew</span> and <span id="id8.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">quantity skew</span> into consideration.
Experiments on these non-IID datasets demonstrate that LotteryFL significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of personalization and communication cost.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is a popular distributed machine learning framework that enables a number of clients to train a shared global model collaboratively without transferring their local data. A central server coordinates the FL process, where each participating client communicates only the model parameters with the central server while keeping local data private. In this way, FL overcomes privacy challenges and allows machine learning models to learn decentralized data.
FL has been applied to many practical applications where data is distributed across clients and too sensitive to be aggregated into a central repository. For example, FL has demonstrated its good performance for the next-word-prediction task on smartphones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The clients that participate in the FL process expect to obtain a shared global model that can provide better performance than the models individually trained by themselves.
In practice,
the distribution of the data across the clients is inherently non-IID (non-identically independently distributed).
Such statistical heterogeneity makes it difficult to train a shared global model that can be well generalized for all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Many studies attempt to mitigate the statistical heterogeneity via performing personalization in FL, including exploiting meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, etc.
These approaches commonly require two separate steps: 1) training a global model collaboratively and 2) adapting the model to each client by using its local data.
Such a two-step process for personalization inevitably induces extra overheads.
Communication cost is another major bottleneck of FL as the communication links between the central server and the participating clients typically operate at a low rate and could be expensive.
Thus, a straightforward approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck is compressing the data communicated between the server and the clients.
Common practices include sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, etc.
However, very few efforts have been spent on addressing these two critical challenges simultaneously,
The only possible exception is LG-FedAvg, which is proposed by Liang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, LG-FedAvg was built based on an unrealistic FL setting, where each client holds sufficient training data (300 images/class of MNIST and 250 images/class of CIFAR-10).
Such a condition implies that a client has already been able to obtain a good performance by training a model locally, which is indeed against the motivation of FL.
Instead, in this work, we consider a more realistic and challenging scenario, where each client owns limited data (e.g., 5 images/class).
As such, none of the clients is able to train a local model with desired performance.

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our work:</span> We design LotteryFL – a personalized and communication-efficient FL framework via exploiting the Lottery Ticket hypothesis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The Lottery Ticket hypothesis offers a simple solution to discover the Lottery Ticket Networks (LTNs), which are sparse subnetworks within a large base model.
Surprisingly, the performance of these LTNs often exceeds that of the non-sparse base model given the same training efforts. Inspired by this property, we propose to seek the LTN of each client during each communication round, and then communicate only the parameters of LTNs between the clients and the server in FL.
After aggregating the LTNs of the clients, the server will distribute the updated parameters of the corresponding LTN to each client.
Finally, a personalized model, instead of a shared global model, will be learned at each client. Since the LTN is determined by pruning the base model using the local data of each client, the data-dependent features have already been incorporated in the LTN.
Considering the non-IID data distribution across the clients, the LTN of each client may not significantly overlap with each other.
Therefore, the personalization property of each LTN can be retained after the aggregation is performed on the server. Additionally, due to the compact size of the LTN, the size of the model parameters that needs to be communicated is reduced.
The communication efficiency of FL can be significantly improved accordingly.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth nothing that no benchmark datasets are yet delicately designed for supporting the research on FL under non-IID settings.
Therefore, we also construct and publish several datasets<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://github.com/jeremy313/non-iid-dataset-for-personalized-federated-learning</span></span></span> to represent the characteristics of practical FL environments under non-IID settings. These non-IID datasets are constructed based on three classical datasets: MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, and EMNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In order to quantitatively evaluate the degree of non-IID data distribution across clients, we define a metric named <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Client-Wise Non-IID Index (CNI)</span>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">EMNIST, an extension of MNIST, represents a more challenging classification task involving both letters and digits.
EMNIST shares the same image structure and parameters as the original MNIST. Moreover, each image in EMNIST is also associated with an attribute ‘By_Author’, which represents the writer of each image. Therefore, EMNIST can be naturally transformed to a non-IID dataset by grouping the handwritten characters images based on the writer. Then, each client holds only a specific writer’s handwritten characters images in our experiments.

We assume the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are distributed across 400 clients.
Moreover, we transform EMNIST to a non-IID dataset by grouping the handwritten characters images based on the writer.
In particular, the EMNIST dataset is distributed across 2424 clients.

As a comparison, we also show CNI values on IID datasets, where each client holds images from all classes and each class has the same number of samples.
We observe that CNI values of non-IID datasets are much higher than those of IID datasets. Moreover, when the balance rate decreases (i.e., a higher degree of unbalance), the CNI becomes larger.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, we evaluate LotteryFL on non-IID datasets under the 2-class balanced setting, where each class consists of 20 samples. We perform the training on MNIST for 400 communication rounds, and for 2000 communication rounds on CIFAR-10 and EMNIST. Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Impact of the number of participating clients per round ‣ 5.3 Comparison of Personalization and Communication Efficiency ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ LotteryFL: Personalized and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning with Lottery Ticket Hypothesis on Non-IID Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the results.
We have the following observations: First, <em id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">LotteryFL can achieve the best personalization with the lowest communication cost</em> on all the three non-IID datasets. For example, when there are 5 participating clients per round, LotteryFL(0.3) can achieve an accuracy of 89.70% on CIFAR-10 non-IID dataset, which is 14.18% and 43.5% higher than that of LG-FedAvg and FedAvg, respectively.
Morever, LG-FedAvg and FedAvg respectively consume 1.38X and 1.81X communication costs compared to LotteryFL.
Standalone method performs the worst in most cases due to insufficient training data on each client.
Second, if more clients participate in the training in each communication round, the personalization performance of all FL methods are improved.
The reason is that more involved clients contribute to a larger number of training data in FL.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, we evaluate the performance of LotteryFL with different number of samples per class on the clients.
We keep 20 participating clients in each communication round.
Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Impact of the number of participating clients per round ‣ 5.3 Comparison of Personalization and Communication Efficiency ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ LotteryFL: Personalized and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning with Lottery Ticket Hypothesis on Non-IID Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the results. Similar to the results in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Impact of the number of participating clients per round ‣ 5.3 Comparison of Personalization and Communication Efficiency ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ LotteryFL: Personalized and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning with Lottery Ticket Hypothesis on Non-IID Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we observe that LotteryFL obtains the best performance on personalization with the lowest communication cost. For example, when each client holds 20 samples per class, LotteryFL(0.1) can reach an accuracy of 90.61% on CIFAR-10 non-IID dataset, while the accuracy of Standalone, FedAvg, and LG-FedAvg are 65.44%, 47.67%, and 76.77%, respectively. Meanwhile, FedAvg and LG-FedAvg consume 3.86X and 2.94X communication costs, respectively, compared with LotteryFL.
Moreover, as the number of samples per class increases, the performance of LotteryFL is also improved. For example, when we increase the number of samples per class from 5 to 10, the accuracy of LotteryFL(0.5) increases from 83.03% to 88.17% on CIFAR-10 non-IID dataset.
Another interesting observation is that, as the number of samples per class increases, the communication cost reduces accordingly.
For example,
the communication cost for LotteryFL(0.1) on CIFAR-10 non-IID dataset is 3832.02Mb when there are 5 samples per class, while it reduces to 2439.56Mb when the number increases to 20. The reason is that more samples can speedup the convergence of the training, and the base model can be pruned more frequently on each client. A more compact model generates less data to be communicated with the server.

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Impact of the balance rate</h4>

<div id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Besides, we also explore the impact of the balance rate on the performance of LotteryFL. In this experiment, we keep the settings as the same as the above two experiments but specify at most 20 samples for one class on the clients. For instance, if the balance rate is 0.25, then one class contains 1-20 samples and the other one has 5 samples. The results in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ Impact of the balance rate ‣ 5.3 Comparison of Personalization and Communication Efficiency ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ LotteryFL: Personalized and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning with Lottery Ticket Hypothesis on Non-IID Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> also show that LotteryFL can significantly improve personalization and communication efficiency together under such challenging settings. In general, the performance of LotteryFL and the compared methods on balanced non-IID dataset is better than that under unbalanced setting. However, within all unbalanced setting, LotteryFL always outperforms the compared methods. For example, when we set balance rate to 0.25 (the worst case), LotteryFL(0.25) can reach an accuracy of 85.29% on CIFAR-10 non-IID dataset. This number is 34.96%, 45.1%, and 16.26% higher than that is achieved by Standalone, FedAvg and LG-Fedavg, respectively. Meanwhile, the communication cost of LotteryFL is reduced by 94% and 48% compared with FedAvg and LG-FedAvg, respectively.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5.4 Behavior of Personalization ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ LotteryFL: Personalized and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning with Lottery Ticket Hypothesis on Non-IID Datasets" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows, with an increasing target pruning rate, the percentage of the personalized parameters of each layer will be higher. Such a phenomenon indicates that applying the iterative pruning based on the Lottery Ticket hypothesis can remove the commonly shared parameters of each layer, but retain the personalized parameters that can represent the features of local data. For example, when we set the target pruning rate to 0.1, there are as high as 93% and 95% personalized parameters in the first convolutional layer and the first fully connected layer of the learned models, which are trained using the CIFAR-10 non-IID dataset. This also explains why the aggregation on the server does not degrade the performance of LotteryFL, since only a small portion of the parameters are overlapped between different clients’ LTNs.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We design LotteryFL – a personalized and communication-efficient FL framework under non-IID settings, which is inspired by the Lottery Ticket hypothesis. We also construct and publish well-designed datasets to support FL under non-IID settings, which could facilitate the research of robust FL under more parasitical environments. In addition, we define CNI, which is the first metric to quantitatively evaluate the degree of non-IID data distribution across clients. The experimental results on non-IID datasets demonstrate that LotteryFL significantly outperforms three compared methods in terms of personalization and communication cost.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Broader Impact</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Any organizations or institutions can be considered as the clients in FL. For example, hospitals hold a huge amount of patient data for intelligent healthcare. However, under restrict privacy regulations or ethical constraints, hospitals may be required to keep the data local. FL is a promising solution for such applications, as it can enable the collaborative learning without compromising privacy. However, some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> have shown that it is feasible to recover the private training data by eavesdropping the data communicated between the clients and the server. Since only the parameters of each client’s LTN will be communicated in LotteryFL and the LTN is dynamically changing during the training process, LotteryFL offers a potential solution to further enhance the privacy under such attacks.</p>
