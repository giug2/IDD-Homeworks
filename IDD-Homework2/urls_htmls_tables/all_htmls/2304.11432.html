<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a cloud-edge collaboration paradigm that enables edge nodes, comprising resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to cooperatively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while retaining their data locally. This paradigm facilitates improved privacy and security for edges and IoT devices, making VFL an essential component of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) systems. Nevertheless, the partitioned structure of VFL can be exploited by adversaries to inject a backdoor, enabling them to manipulate the VFL predictions. In this paper, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of VFL in the context of binary classification tasks. To this end, we define a threat model for backdoor attacks in VFL and introduce a universal adversarial backdoor (UAB) attack to poison the predictions of VFL. The UAB attack, consisting of universal trigger generation and clean-label backdoor injection, is incorporated during the VFL training at specific iterations. This is achieved by alternately optimizing the universal trigger and model parameters of VFL sub-problems. Our work distinguishes itself from existing studies on designing backdoor attacks for VFL, as those require the knowledge of auxiliary information not accessible within the split VFL architecture. In contrast, our approach does not necessitate any additional data to execute the attack. On the LendingClub and Zhongyuan datasets, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 100% backdoor task performance while maintaining the main task performance. Our results in this paper make a major advance to revealing the hidden backdoor risks of VFL, hence paving the way for the future development of secure AIoT.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, deep learning has become a prevalent field of machine learning, driven by massive amounts of data, and achieved great success in various domains. As concerns about data privacy grow, there has been a considerable shift in attention from centralized deep learning settings to distributed cloud-edge collaboration. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a cloud-edge collaboration paradigm where multiple parties, such as edge nodes or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, work together to train a machine model while keeping their data locally. This approach enables participants to leverage shared knowledge and enhance model performance without directly exchanging sensitive information, thereby addressing critical concerns related to data privacy and security. Vertical federated learning (VFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is a significant branch of FL where participants share different features of the same samples. As a standard Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) application, VFL is extensively employed in data-sensitive industries such as finance and healthcare, where multiple parties collaborate to perform intelligent data analysis tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While VFL was initially developed to safeguard data privacy, it has attracted considerable attention due to its own inherent security concerns<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Privacy leakage is the most direct attack, where the adversary aims to infer the features or labels of other participants through the gradient information<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Compared with features, labels are more susceptible to attacks due to their importance. Furthermore, labels can also be the target of model poisoning attacks in VFL, referred to as backdoor attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Universal Adversarial Backdoor Attacks to Fool Vertical Federated Learning in Cloud-Edge Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> presents a financial credit scenario that exemplifies a practical VFL cloud-edge collaboration setup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In this scenario, the bank and the lending platform serve as edge nodes, gathering data from IoT devices, such as online purchases and cell phone consumption records. These datasets share the same users but different features, with the bank and lending platform managing their respective data sets. The evaluation agency collaborates with the edge nodes in the role of the cloud. VFL performs credit prediction tasks collaboratively based on the cloud-edge collaboration with data securely preserved in local edge nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">By utilizing different features of the same users in the lending platforms, the bank aims to avoid lending to applicants with low credit scores. Subsequently, an evaluation agency makes the decision on whether to approve loans or not. However, an adversary (e.g., the lending platform) may attempt to obtain loan approvals for low-credit applicants by locally poisoning clean features. Such actions present a considerable security risk within VFL, as adversaries could manipulate VFL predictions to serve their interests. Owing to the data separation inherent to VFL, a locally executed backdoor attack by a single participant remains highly covert, posing a substantial threat to the overall VFL system.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the existence of backdoor attack vulnerabilities in VFL, there has been limited exploration in the literature. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> employed predefined triggers and a small number of samples with the target label to facilitate label replacement attacks (LRB). CoPur <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> utilized feature-flipping and projected gradient descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> (PGD) attacks to poison predictions during the inference stage of VFL. However, due to the partitioned structure of VFL, adversaries do not have access to complete data and labels, making it challenging to implement these approaches. Moreover, LRB<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> occurring during VFL training can compromise the performance of the main task, while CoPur <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> in the inference phase may result in less effective attack performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To investigate the presence of backdoor vulnerabilities in VFL, this paper introduces the Universal Adversarial Backdoor (UAB) attack, targeting a standard VFL architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> commonly used in finance and healthcare domains for binary classification tasks. As CoPur exhibits insufficient attack performance, the UAB approach focuses on the training phase of VFL. Given the unavailability of labels and complete features in the VFL framework, the UAB method utilizes Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to introduce a clean-label backdoor attack. This approach enables the conduct of a stealthy and efficient backdoor attack in VFL without modifying any labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, thereby maintaining the performance of the main task<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The UAB attack consists of two parts: 1) universal trigger generation, and 2) clean-label backdoor injection. Specifically, UAB generates the universal trigger using the UAP method, which is then injected into the VFL training process. To conduct a targeted backdoor attack, UAB capitalizes on the class skew property present in binary classification tasks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, enabling the inference of a small number of samples with non-target pseudo labels. As a result, the universal trigger captures important features of the target class, ultimately leading to misclassification into the target class through clean-label backdoor injection. As a standard bi-level optimization problem, UAB successfully conducts backdoor attacks by alternatively optimizing the universal trigger generation and clean-label backdoor injection sub-problems during the VFL training process at specific iterations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, due to the adversary’s lack of access to labels during the inference phase, the victim samples encompass all categories. In terms of evaluating backdoor task performance in VFL, it is crucial to take into account not only the attack success rate (ASR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> for non-target class samples but also the attack robustness rate (ARR) of the target class samples. Therefore, based on class imbalanced binary classification tasks, we employ AUC, F1, ASR and ARR metrics to evaluate the performance of UAB’s main and backdoor tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">We demonstrate the performance of the UAB attack on two public credit datasets, namely LendingClub and Zhongyuan. The ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the UAB attack. On the evaluation metrics, our approach attains attack success rates exceeding 90% or even reaching 100% in various instances, while maintaining the main task performance unaffected. Additionally, we test our approach on several advanced defense methods to show the great threat of the UAB attack. The main contributions of our paper can be summarized as follows:</p>

FL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which participants collaboratively train a model while retaining their data locally. FL can be categorized into horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning (VFL), and federated transfer learning, based on the different partitioning schemes of the sample and feature spaces. VFL refers to the FL setting in which participants have different features for the same set of samples. The unique data distribution characteristics of VFL make it a promising approach in various domains, including finance, advertising, and healthcare. Specifically, Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a privacy-preserving VFL framework designed specifically for financial applications, emphasizing feature interpretability. By employing this privacy-preserving VFL framework, credit loan performance can be significantly enhanced. To improve advertising conversion rates, Li et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> devised a label-protected VFL framework that ensures both privacy and effectiveness in the advertising domain. Fu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> have achieved great progress in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> with a VFL framework. Depending on the application context, VFL architectures can be categorized into splitVFL, aggVFL, splitVFLc, and aggVFLc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For binary classification tasks in the financial domain, this paper uses the splitVFL architecture as the VFL baseline. For simplicity, we will refer to this architecture as VFL throughout the paper.</p>

While VFL has made significant strides in practical fields like finance and advertising, concerns have been raised about potential security vulnerabilities. Fu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposed direct label inference (DL) and model completion (MC) methods. DL seeks to infer labels using gradients of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the output layer of the adversary. MC, based on the adversary’s bottom model, retrains the complete model with a small amount of labeled data, allowing for precise label inference. Li et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> utilized direction and norm scoring methods to infer labels of the active party, based on the distribution difference between positive and negative samples. Zou et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> stole the labels of the active party with gradient inversion. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed label replacement attacks to substitute specific labels with target ones, referred to as backdoor attacks. However, this method requires awareness of clean samples with target labels and is easily detected by the active party, as it can significantly degrade main task performance. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> employed the projected gradient descent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> (PGD) and feature-flipping attacks to poison VFL predictions. These approaches still rely on auxiliary labels or are ineffective. In this paper, we propose the UAB method, encompassing universal trigger generation and clean-label backdoor injection. Without any auxiliary data or labels, UAB achieves excellent backdoor task performance while maintaining main task performance.</p>

Szegedy et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> demonstrated that imperceptible additive perturbations could be crafted to alter the decisions of deep learning models, causing misclassifications, while humans can still correctly identify the images. The fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and its iterative version <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> used a one-step gradient ascent calculation to efficiently craft adversarial examples. Madry et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> introduced the PGD method, approaching the problem from an optimization perspective, and demonstrated highly effective attacks. DeepFool <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> computed adversarial perturbations iteratively by linearizing the attacked model’s decision boundaries near the input images. In addition to sample-dependent adversarial attacks, Katholm et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> developed UAP designed to fool a group of images for the target category. UAP exploits the DeepFool method to generate perturbations that can successfully mislead a model’s classification for multiple samples within the target category. Shafahi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed a simple optimization-based universal attack to enhance the efficiency of universal attacks. UAP can also be integrated with backdoor attacks. Turner et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> employed adversarial perturbations to execute a clean-label attack. Furthermore, Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> extended this concept by using UAP as the trigger for the backdoor attack. Motivated by this idea, our research investigates clean-label backdoor attacks in VFL using the UAP method, which does not require access to labels.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the VFL backdoor attack setting discussed in this paper, the main task refers to the binary classification problem represented in Eq.

The backdoor task, on the other hand, is designed to falsify the predictions of target category samples when specific triggers are injected into the input data. As the model and data in VFL are distributed locally across each party, several crucial challenges must be addressed when considering backdoor attacks in VFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, a passive adversary has no access to labels in the active party and, as a result, cannot modify target class labels. This limitation means that the adversary must focus on other strategies to achieve a successful backdoor attack, such as utilizing the gradients received from the active party.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Secondly, since the data is stored locally at each party, the passive adversary can inject backdoor triggers into their data without raising suspicion from other participating parties. This local data storage means that the triggers do not require visual concealment, making it easier for the adversary to embed the backdoor locally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Lastly, in addition to ASR performance, backdoor task in VFL should also consider the robustness of target class samples to injected triggers. It is important to ensure that only the non-target class is affected by the backdoor attack while maintaining the performance of target class. This is because the adversary does not have access to the labels during the inference process, and the poisoned samples encompass all categories. If the target class samples are not robust to the triggers, such non-targeted attacks can easily raise suspicion and prompt human inspection by the active party.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To address these issues, we propose the UAB attack to inject a clean-label backdoor in VFL. By capitalizing on the class skew of positive and negative samples in binary classification tasks, the UAB attack enables an effective and stealthy backdoor attack that depends exclusively on the attacker’s local data, without the need for any auxiliary label information. This approach takes advantage of the intrinsic properties of imbalanced datasets, which in turn makes the detection and mitigation of the backdoor attack more difficult.</p>

The adversary acts as an honest-but-curious passive party that has no control over the active party in VFL; instead, it strictly adheres to the VFL protocol.

In binary classification tasks, the importance of positive and negative samples can vary depending on the specific application. For instance, in credit fraud detection, misidentifying defaulting users as trusted ones poses a more significant threat, whereas in click-through rate prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, an adversary might be more inclined to misclassify negative samples as positive ones in order to request more charges. Moreover, the imbalanced nature of the binary classification task often leads to the VFL model being biased towards the majority category. This inherent bias presents different levels of difficulty for target categories 0 and 1 in the UAB attack. To explore the capacity of the UAB attack and better understand its effectiveness under different circumstances, we investigate its implications when the backdoor target class is either 0 or 1, as per the scenarios presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>

Although data is stored locally for each party, the adversary in VFL can still gain some knowledge about the other parties based on the task information available to them. In this paper, we assume the adversary is aware that the main task in the VFL setup is an imbalanced binary classification problem. In addition, the adversary has no knowledge of any whole samples and labels.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The overview of the backdoor attack in VFL is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-C Threat Model ‣ III Problem Formulation ‣ Universal Adversarial Backdoor Attacks to Fool Vertical Federated Learning in Cloud-Edge Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The UAB attack comprises two stages. In the first stage, the adversary trains the universal trigger by maximizing the binary cross-entropy loss in the active party of VFL. In the second stage, the adversary injects the universal trigger into the entire training data to implant a clean-label backdoor attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> in the VFL model. The universal trigger can activate the backdoor during the inference process of VFL, resulting in misclassifications in the predictions. ASR and ARR are employed to measure the performance of the backdoor task, while AUC and F1 are utilized to evaluate the performance of the main task of UAB. In this section, we delve into the details of the UAB attack within the VFL framework.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the adversary’s lack of knowledge about label information and the fact that visual concealment is not necessary under the VFL split architecture, the adversary uses all local training data as poisoned samples. However, large-scale poisoned data can impair the performance of the main VFL task, potentially raising suspicion among other parties, particularly the active party. Moreover, the bi-level optimization problem in Eq. (<a href="#S4.E7" title="In IV-C Optimization of the UAB attack ‣ IV UAB attack in VFL ‣ Universal Adversarial Backdoor Attacks to Fool Vertical Federated Learning in Cloud-Edge Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>) can have an effect similar to adversarial training, which may also result in performance degradation for the backdoor task. To address these issues, UAB employs a one-time attack strategy. In particular, the UAB attack is executed at a specific iteration during the training process. In this backdoor iteration, Eq. (<a href="#S4.E7" title="In IV-C Optimization of the UAB attack ‣ IV UAB attack in VFL ‣ Universal Adversarial Backdoor Attacks to Fool Vertical Federated Learning in Cloud-Edge Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>) alternately optimizes the upper-level and lower-level sub-problems across multiple batches.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of the UAB attack within the VFL framework, the main task of VFL is binary classification, while the backdoor task aims to inject a backdoor into VFL. This backdoor allows for the misclassification of source class samples into target class when activated. Owing to the common occurrence of class imbalance in binary VFL classification tasks, particularly in finance and healthcare domains, traditional accuracy evaluation metrics may exhibit bias towards negative samples. This can result in an inadequate assessment of both classification and backdoor task performance. To address this issue, we design the metrics for the UAB attack.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the main task, we adopt AUC and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the VFL main task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Moreover, considering the need for concealment and effectiveness of the backdoor task, we introduce evaluation metrics that include ASR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and ARR. ASR measures the proportion of non-target class samples that are successfully misclassified due to the UAB attack. ARR, on the other hand, evaluates the proportion of target class samples that remain correctly classified under the UAB attack. The metrics are as follows:</p>

Firstly, we demonstrate the details of experiment setup. Then we propose a VFL backdoor baseline to evaluate the performance of our UAB approach. Based on the backdoor baseline, we conduct a comparison with state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods, highlighting the superiority of the UAB attack. In addition, we analyze the performance of the UAB attack in VFL. Furthermore, we perform ablation experiments on the number of the pseudo labels and attack iteration of UAB, which validates the success of the targeted backdoor attack. Finally, we evaluated the robustness of UAB under state-of-the-art defense methods.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most significant concerns with VFL backdoor attacks is the adversary’s inability to access or manipulate labels in the active party, which restricts the efficacy of traditional backdoor learning approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Although there are a few studies available on VFL backdoor attacks, they are predominantly based on assumptions of auxiliary knowledge, such as the presence of clean target samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of VFL backdoor attacks, we establish a backdoor baseline (BB) for VFL by assuming that the adversary can manipulate labels within the active party. In the baseline setting, we randomly selected 1% of the adversary’s training features to inject backdoor triggers generated with random Gaussian noise, following the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Simultaneously, the adversary flips the labels of the poisoned samples to match the backdoor target. Specifically, we randomly sampled 862 poisoned samples from the training set of the LendingClub dataset, of which 68 samples were labeled as positive. In the case of the Zhongyuan dataset, a total of 80 training samples were randomly selected as poisoned samples, out of which 16 samples were labeled as positive. While the manipulation of labels in VFL is unattainable, BB can serve as a strong baseline for evaluating the efficacy of VFL backdoor attacks. BB represents a high level of performance that can be achieved through backdoor attacks within VFL framework, enabling researchers to assess the efficacy of novel VFL backdoor attack methods.

As targeted CoPur is an inference attack, the performance of the main task remains consistent with the VFL baseline.

When the target class is negative, the UAB attack demonstrates superior performance in terms of both ASR and ARR metrics (99.49% and 100%). The results indicate that the attack has the ability to manipulate nearly all positive samples, causing them to be misidentified as negative. Conversely, negative samples containing the universal trigger continue to be accurately predicted as negative. Furthermore, under the UAB attack, the performance of the main task does not deteriorate compared to the benchmark; in fact, it exhibits a slight improvement. When the target class is positive, the UAB and BB methods exhibit comparable performance in terms of ASR and ARR metrics, with both achieving the highest level of accuracy. This result suggests that UAB can also tamper with almost all triggered negative samples, while maintaining the positive samples unchanged. Additionally, the UAB attack still maintains optimal performance in the main task.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In the case of the Zhongyuan dataset, UAB achieves the highest level of performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods when the backdoor target is negative. In instances where the backdoor target is positive, the FF method has the best performance and the UAB attack exhibits a 5.5% decrease in ASR. However, the FF method cannot address the case where the target label is negative. Therefore, UAB remains a highly competitive backdoor attack method on the small-scale Zhongyuan dataset. The observed reduction in backdoor performance of UAB could be attributed to the limited classification capacity of VFL on Zhongyuan dataset. Due to Zhongyuan’s limited dataset of 10,000, the model has a restricted ability to accurately identify positive samples. The VFL baseline mistakenly classifies 66.83% of positive samples as negative samples, which has a negative impact on the generation of universal trigger in the UAB attack for positive backdoor target.</p>

<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The VFL baseline model exhibits greater precision values on the LendingClub and Zhonggyuan datasets, scoring 99.24% and 52.18%, respectively, when compared to the recall metric. These results imply that the model’s predictions lean towards negative samples, which can be attributed to the imbalanced nature of the binary task. This imbalanced nature is also reflected in the UAB attack. For example, on the Zhongyuan dataset, the ASR metric of VFL baseline for the positive and negative target categories were 6.45% and 66.38%, respectively. Specifically, the VFL baseline misclassifies 66.38% of positive samples as negative, while only 6.45% of negative samples are incorrectly identified as positive on the Zhongyuan dataset. This phenomenon suggests that UAB faces varying levels of difficulty in backdooring positive and negative categories. Consequently, to assess the effectiveness of the UAB attack, it is essential to evaluate its performance on both positive and negative categories as backdoor targets. Likewise, there exists a significant discrepancy in the ASR metric for the positive and negative target backdoor categories in the LendingClub dataset for the VFL baseline model, with values of 0.04% and 32.15%, respectively. This difference further emphasizes the requirement for a comprehensive evaluation of the UAB attack on both positive and negative categories as backdoor targets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, by comparing the results of the main task with the VFL baseline, we can observe the process of backdoor injection process of UAB. Following the UAB attack, the metrics associated with the main task present discernible changes in comparison to those of the VFL baseline. On both the LendingClub and Zhongyuan datasets, the AUC and F1 metrics for the main task deviate significantly from the VFL baseline, irrespective of the backdoor target category being 1 or 0. These observed changes in performance serve as an empirical indication of the backdoor injection process linked to the UAB attack, wherein the VFL model parameters are manipulated based on the universal trigger crafted by the adversary.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-D Performance of the UAB attack in VFL ‣ V Experiments ‣ Universal Adversarial Backdoor Attacks to Fool Vertical Federated Learning in Cloud-Edge Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> demonstrates the enhancement of the UAB attack on the model’s classification ability for category 1. For instance, on the Zhongyuan dataset, there is a 3.13% improvement in the recall metric for the main task relative to the baseline model for both backdoor target categories 0 and 1. This contrasts with conventional backdoor attacks, which typically weaken the main task performance. This improvement can be attributed to the fact that UAB utilizes the entire training dataset for poisoning, which in turn increases the diversity of the data to a certain extent, leading to an improvement in the model’s generalization capabilities.</p>

Nevertheless, for large-scale datasets, such as LendingClub, which also exhibit good predictive power for positive class, this can lead to smaller <math id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p_{1}-y" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">p</mi><mn id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">−</mo><mi id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">y</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1"><minus id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.1"></minus><apply id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑝</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.3">1</cn></apply><ci id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑦</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS5.p4.1.m1.1c">p_{1}-y</annotation></semantics></math> values in Eq.

In the case of a backdoor target of 1, UAB demonstrates excellent ASR during the training ramp-up and intermediate phases.

In this case, there is a 5% decrease in ASR for a target category of 0 and a 20% decrease for a target category of 1, in comparison to the optimal attack performance. This may be because at the end of VFL training, the model tends to converge and the gradient update gradually decreases, which to some extent affects the optimization of the universal trigger in UAB, thus weakening the attack performance<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.

Specifically, if the defense method can minimize the misidentification rate of the VFL model while preserving its main task classification performance, it can be inferred that the defense approach effectively protects VFL from the threat posed by the UAB attack.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS8.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS8.p8.1" class="ltx_p">On the LendingClub dataset, the Max-Norm method attains the best defense performance with an ASR of 12.57% when the backdoor target is class 0. This implies that only 12.57% of the poisoned positive samples will be misclassified as negative. Remarkably, it enhances the classification ability of VFL by 19.58% for class 1 compared to the VFL baseline. However, the ARR value of Max-Norm drops to 57.42% relative to the VFL baseline, signifying that 42.58% of the poisoned negative samples will be misidentified as positive. This suggests that the Max-Norm defense for target class 0 is achieved at the cost of the classification ability of another category. Similarly, for target class 1, the Marvell method obtains the best defense performance with an ASR of 0.04, but concurrently, the ARR value decreases by 20.75% compared to the VFL baseline.</p>

<p id="S5.SS8.p9.1" class="ltx_p">On the Zhongyuan dataset, for a backdoor target category of 0, the best defense method is Max-Norm, with an ASR of 42.83%, better than the VFL baseline. However, it sacrifices the classification ability for category 1, with an ARR of 72.35%, a 21.20% drop compared to the VFL baseline. When the backdoor target category is 1, Marvell achieves the best defense performance with ASR and ARR of 28.81% and 59.71%, respectively. Compared to the VFL baseline, there is still a 22.36% gap in ASR performance, while ARR exceeds the VFL baseline by 26.29%. This indicates that although Marvell improves the model’s classification ability for category 1, it is still vulnerable to the UAB attack. It is worth noting that both Max-Norm and Marvell methods improve the main task performance, especially in the F1 metric. This may be due to the small size of the Zhongyuan dataset resulting in the significant model bias. The Max-Norm and Marvell methods enhance the equilibrium of the model to some extent through the strategy of positive and negative sample rebalancing.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, to evaluate the secure in cloud-edge collaboration environments, we present the UAB attack designed to inject a backdoor into binary classification tasks of VFL. The attack consists of two components: universal trigger generation and clean-label backdoor injection. The objective of the universal trigger generation is to train the universal trigger that captures crucial features of the target class. Subsequently, this universal trigger is utilized by the clean-label backdoor injection to poison the model parameters of VFL, leading to misclassifications into the target class. In this study, we opt for a widely used financial scenario to assess the potential security and privacy risks associated with AIoT. Our proposed UAB method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on the LendingClub and Zhongyuan datasets, even attaining an ASR approaching 100%. Through the assessment of representative defense methods, we establish that UAB indeed presents a significant threat to AIoT systems. This analysis also offers valuable insights that can guide the development of reliable and secure AIoT systems. In the future, we plan to explore the robustness certification against the UAB attack to establish a trusted AIoT framework.</p>
