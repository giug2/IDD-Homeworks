<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The challenge of data scarcity hinders the application of deep learning in industrial surface defect classification (SDC), as it’s difficult to collect and centralize sufficient training data from various entities in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) provides a solution by enabling collaborative global model training across clients while maintaining privacy. However, performance may suffer due to data heterogeneity—discrepancies in data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL (PFL) approach, named Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning (AFedCL), for the challenge of data heterogeneity across different clients in SDC. First, we develop a dynamic consensus construction strategy to mitigate the performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity. Through adversarial training, local models from different clients utilize the global model as a bridge to achieve distribution alignment, alleviating the problem of global knowledge forgetting. Complementing this strategy, we propose a consensus-aware aggregation mechanism. It assigns aggregation weights to different clients based on their efficacy in global knowledge learning, thereby enhancing the global model’s generalization capabilities. Finally, we design an adaptive feature fusion module to further enhance global knowledge utilization efficiency. Personalized fusion weights are gradually adjusted for each client to optimally balance global and local features, tailored to their individual global knowledge learning efficacy. Compared with state-of-the-art FL methods like FedALA, the proposed AFedCL method achieves an accuracy increase of up to 5.67% on three SDC datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been widely deployed across various industrial sectors, facilitating distributed data acquisition and real-time monitoring among geographically dispersed industrial entities. Surface defect inspection, as one of the critical tasks of IIoT, has gained significant attention due to its impact on the quality and safety of industrial products. In recent decades, substantial research has focused on developing methods to detect and classify surface defects, thereby enabling production line adjustments and quality improvements<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Traditional surface defect classification (SDC) methods often rely on manual inspection, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to human errors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence with IIoT has provided new automation solutions across various industries, significantly enhancing efficiency and effectiveness<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Traditional machine learning classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, have been utilized for automated SDC. These classifiers are typically coupled with some shape-based and texture-based feature extraction methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, such as Fourier descriptor and local binary pattern. However, they suffer from limited feature extraction capabilities due to reliance on manual features, inadequately capturing the diversity of surface defects, thus limiting generalization and adaptability in SDC tasks. On the contrary, deep learning (DL)-based methods are capable of learning abstract representations autonomously, without the need for manual feature engineering. In particular, DL-based classifiers built on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, such as ResNet and MobileNet, consistently demonstrate superior performance in SDC tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, DL-based SDC methods require sufficient data to develop robust models, which a single entity often cannot provide <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. To overcome this limitation, data must be collected from multiple entities, and aggregated at a centralized location, such as a central server. This process of data aggregation not only exposes sensitive information to potential breaches but also conflicts with privacy regulations.
Federated learning (FL), a paradigm enabling model training across distributed participants, known as clients, while preserving data privacy and security, effectively addresses the aforementioned challenge of data scarcity and privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. By allowing data to remain local and only merging model parameters trained with local data, FL effectively enhances DL model performance without compromising data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the practical implementation of FL encounters significant challenges due to data heterogeneity. Variations in production conditions, such as differences in equipment and environmental factors, result in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across participating clients. For instance, different industrial entities may encounter varying categories of defect samples, leading to discrepancies in the feature representations learned by their models. Such discrepancies make it difficult for different clients to reach a consensus on learned representations. When the uploaded models are aggregated, the global model may become biased towards certain clients, thereby undermining overall performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we summarize the two key challenges in real-world SDC scenarios. First, data scarcity and privacy concerns significantly impair the capacity of industrial entities to gather sufficient data essential for training DL models. Second, variations in production conditions across different industrial entities result in non-IID data. Given that most learning algorithms assume data to be IID, DL models may suffer significant performance degradation due to the data heterogeneity among different clients in IIoT.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned challenges prevalent in SDC, we propose a personalized FL (PFL) approach, named Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning (AFedCL). It facilitates collaborative training among multiple clients, allowing the development of personalized models tailored to the specific data distributions of each client while preserving privacy. Distinguishing from prior PFL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, AFedCL utilizes adversarial training with the global model as a bridge to achieve data distribution alignment across different clients, addressing the problem of global knowledge forgetting in local training explicitly. It significantly improves the ability of local models to extract distribution-invariant features, which are characteristics that remain consistent across varied data distributions among clients, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Previous studies have addressed the issue of data scarcity through two main aspects. On one hand, some research focuses on leveraging few-shot learning algorithms. For instance, Kim et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a siamese neural network with CNN structure to overcome the data scarcity challenge in steel SDC. Similarly, Xiao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> applied graph embedding and distribution transformation modules, coupled with optimal transport for transductive classification. On the other hand, an alternative strategy involves the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize defect samples, thus enlarging the sample volume. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, three GANs are trained to augment the data for surface defects. Furthermore, a cycle-consistent adversarial network with attention mechanism, named AttenCGAN, was proposed to address the challenges of small intra-class differences and data scarcity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite some progress in overcoming the challenges posed by limited data, the performance of these models is still held back by the small size of local datasets. In the scenario of distributed industrial data sources, the efficient exploitation of distributed data sources, while maintaining privacy, can significantly boost model performance and unlock the full potential of the data.</p>

FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, recognized as the pioneering method in FL, has received increasing attention in recent years.

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As the field evolved, the focus shifted towards developing PFL algorithms to cope with the problem of data heterogeneity. These algorithms aim to train personalized models for each participating client rather than a “one-fit-all” global model. FedPer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and FedRep <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> adopted parameters decoupling strategy, dividing the model into shared layers and private layers, where the private layers are trained locally and not shared with the server. Ditto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> leveraged multi-task learning to learn personalized local models. FedALA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> adaptively aggregated the downloaded global model and local model towards the local objective on each client to initialize the local model before training in each iteration.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Previous FL algorithms designed for heterogeneous data have made significant efforts to integrate global knowledge into local training. This integration enables models to adapt to local datasets while concurrently assimilating comprehensive global knowledge.

<p id="S3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The FL training process consists of multiple communication rounds, each involving parallel local training of each client and model aggregation on the server side. At each communication round, the server dispatches the global model to all clients. Each client replaces their local model with the received global model, trains it on local data, and then uploads the trained model back to the server. Then the server aggregates the received models to generate the global model for the next round. Conventionally, FL aims to learn a single global model, i.e., <math id="S3.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="W_{1}=W_{2}=...=W_{k}=W" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">W</mi><mn id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">=</mo><msub id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.2" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.2.cmml">W</mi><mn id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.3" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><mo id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.5" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml">=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.6" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml">…</mi><mo id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.7" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml">=</mo><msub id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml"><mi id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.2" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.2.cmml">W</mi><mi id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.3" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><mo id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.9" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.9.cmml">=</mo><mi id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.10" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.10.cmml">W</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"><and id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1a.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"></and><apply id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1b.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.3"></eq><apply id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑊</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.2">𝑊</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.3">2</cn></apply></apply><apply id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1c.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.5"></eq><share href="#S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1d.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"></share><ci id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.6">…</ci></apply><apply id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1e.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.7.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.7"></eq><share href="#S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.6.cmml" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1f.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"></share><apply id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.2.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.2">𝑊</ci><ci id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.3.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.3">𝑘</ci></apply></apply><apply id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1g.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.9.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.9"></eq><share href="#S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.8.cmml" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1h.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1"></share><ci id="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.10.cmml" xref="S3.p6.1.m1.1.1.10">𝑊</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.1.m1.1c">W_{1}=W_{2}=...=W_{k}=W</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In scenarios where local data distributions vary significantly, models may focus on learning specific characteristics of local data, risking the loss of global knowledge acquired from the global model. To ensure the persistent retention of global knowledge during local training, we develop the first stage of local training (step 2) with ongoing evaluation of global knowledge acquisition and immediate feedback based on adversarial training. Specifically, beyond the classification task, a local discriminator is trained to differentiate between the features extracted by global and local encoders from the identical samples. Concurrently, the local encoder endeavors to confound the discriminator, creating an adversarial game process with the discriminator’s training.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As communication rounds increase, the discriminator’s ability to distinguish between global and local features strengthens, alongside the encoder’s ability to confuse the discrimination, fostering an adversarial game process. As a result, the similarity between global and local features from identical samples improves. Local encoders imitate the global encoder’s feature patterns, learning to extract discriminative features across different distributions. This alignment process enhances the ability of local encoders to extract distribution-invariant features, which are characteristics that remain consistent across varying distributions, thus constructing a consensus gradually among various clients and enhancing model performance.</p>

In the server, the objective is to generate a global model with stronger generalization ability. As we discussed before, a higher discrimination loss value leads to a more similar pattern between the global and local features, indicating a greater contribution of global knowledge. Therefore, during the model aggregation stage (step 4), our designed consensus-aware aggregation mechanism assigns higher weights to clients with greater discrimination loss values.

Fig. 5 presents a linear regression analysis indicating that clients with lower discrimination loss receive larger fusion weights after training, which suggests that clients with poorer global knowledge learning efficacy exhibit a greater reliance on global features. This underscores the adaptive feature fusion module’s critical role in adjusting the balance between global and local features according to each client’s specific learning efficacy, further validating the use of discrimination loss as a measure of global knowledge learning efficacy in our method.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To intuitively compare model performance across methods, we utilize the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique to visualize the feature representations extracted by FedAvg, FedRep, FedALA, and our AFedCL method using the NEU-CLS dataset in a disjoint setting where each client has two random categories. In Fig. 7, rows and columns represent clients and methods, respectively, with different colors indicating distinct data categories.
It demonstrates that AFedCL achieves more cohesive clustering within classes and clearer separation between different classes, particularly in the tasks of client 0 and client 2. In contrast, other methods struggle to clearly distinguish between different classes in these cases, highlighting the enhanced performance of the proposed AFedCL method.</p>

For No-FL, where each client learns only from individual local data, the performance is the worst, reflecting the problem posed by data scarcity and the necessity of adopting FL.
Among the FL methods, the two one-fit-all methods, including FedAvg and FedProx, generally exhibit inferior performance. This can be attributed to the challenge posed by data heterogeneity, impairing the performance of the global model.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have developed a novel PFL approach, AFedCL, to tackle the challenge of data heterogeneity in SDC. It enables multiple industrial entities in IIoT to collaboratively train personalized models while preserving privacy.
Specifically, a dynamic consensus construction strategy has been invented to achieve distribution alignment among different clients through an adversarial game process, thus mitigating performance degradation caused by global knowledge forgetting under non-IID data.
Building on this, a consensus-aware aggregation mechanism has been introduced. It assigns aggregating weights based on the global knowledge learning efficacy, measured by each client’s discrimination loss, improving the generalization ability of the global model, and facilitating better consensus construction.
Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion module has been designed. Through the optimization of personalized scalar fusion weights of global and local features, the utilization efficiency of global knowledge is enhanced, thus boosting model performance.
The proposed method demonstrates promising results across extensive experiments on three real-world SDC datasets, achieving a notable increase in accuracy of up to 5.67%.</p>
