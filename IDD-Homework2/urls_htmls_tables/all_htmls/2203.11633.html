<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Model poisoning attacks on federated learning intrude in the entire system via compromising an edge model, resulting in malfunctioning of machine learning models. Such compromised models are tampered with to perform adversary-desired behaviors. In particular, we considered a semi-targeted situation where the source class is predetermined however the target class is not. The goal is to cause the global classifier to misclassify data of the source class. Though approaches such as label flipping have been adopted to inject poisoned parameters into federated learning, it has been shown that their performances are usually class-sensitive varying with different target classes applied. Typically, an attack can become less effective when shifting to a different target class. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Attacking Distance-aware Attack (ADA) to enhance a poisoning attack by finding the optimized target class in the feature space. Moreover, we studied a more challenging situation where an adversary had limited prior knowledge about a client’s data. To tackle this problem, ADA deduces pair-wise distances between different classes in the latent feature space from shared model parameters based on the backward error analysis. We performed extensive empirical evaluations on ADA by varying the factor of attacking frequency in three different image classification tasks. As a result, ADA succeeded in increasing the attack performance by 1.8 times in the most challenging case with an attacking frequency of 0.01.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data privacy has become a major concern attracting attention from many walks of life. In particular, the growing public awareness of data privacy and legal restrictions such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> have rendered classical centralized processing of sensitive data in machine learning (ML) more and more difficult. Due to concerns about critical data breaches in a centralized ML pipeline, decentralized solutions such as federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> have been leveraged to facilitate distributed model training and performance improvement via trained model sharing and aggregation, without disclosing training data of clients.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its broad application in lots of fields such as medical image classification, financial data analysis, cybersecurity, and so on, FL has been shown venerable to adversarial attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. A compromised edge client can inject malicious parameters into the entire FL systems, causing malfunctioning of ML models and extending influence to other clients in the systems (Fig.<a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Semi-Targeted Model Poisoning Attack on Federated Learning via Backward Error Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>). Moreover, these attacks are usually either untargeted or targeted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The goal of the untargeted attacks is to degrade a classifier’s performance in general. In contrast, the targeted attack aims to compromise the classifier such that it misclassifies samples of a specified class into an adversary’s desired class.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we focus on a novel type of poisoning attack, where the motivation of the attacker is avoiding being recognized as a specific class. This type of adversary can arise in various real-world situations. For example, an attacker who sends unauthorized advertising mails aims to have that mail recognized as belonging to some benign class other than spam. In a facial recognition system, a person on a blacklist aims to be recognized by someone else not on the blacklist. Note that these attackers are not motivated to be recognized as a particular class (as the targeted attack aims to), but rather to be unrecognized as a particular class.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We formulate this type of attack as a semi-targeted attack. In the semi-targeted attack, we suppose the adversary is assigned a class (source class), and the aim of the adversary is to poison the classifier so that samples with the source class are recognized as a class other than the source class. Different from the targeted attack, the adversary can freely choose a target class so that the attack performance is maximized in the semi-targeted attack. Due to this freedom of attack, the risk of the semi-targeted attack outweighs the risk of the targeted attack always.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on the assigned source class, the attack’s successability can be different. In other words, the attack is typically class-sensitive regarding generality, attack performance varying from case to case with various classes considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The challenge in the semi-targeted attack is how to find the target class optimized for the assigned source class resulting in the best attack performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed two approaches to find the optimized target class to mount an attack in the full knowledge and partial knowledge settings respectively. Our goal is to investigate to what extent the attack performance can be increased in the semi-targeted setting regarding different approaches to choosing the target classes.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">1) We introduced a new type of poisoning attack called the semi-targeted attack, provided a detailed formulation, and studied the risk of this type of attack in a federated setting.</p>

<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">2) We proposed a semi-targeted model positioning attack called the ADA to compromise the classifier by carefully choosing the target class (Section <a href="#S4.SS3.SSS1" title="IV-C1 Attacking with Full Knowledge ‣ IV-C Attack Method ‣ IV Attacking Distance-aware Attack ‣ Semi-Targeted Model Poisoning Attack on Federated Learning via Backward Error Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span>1</span></a>). Based on a backward error analysis of the global model, the update gradient’s scale for producing a poisoned model was computed to measure the expected attack performance when choosing a certain class (Fig.<a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Semi-Targeted Model Poisoning Attack on Federated Learning via Backward Error Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>). In this regard, we demonstrated the Fast LAyer gradient MEthod (FLAME) in the partial knowledge setting (Section <a href="#S4.SS3.SSS2" title="IV-C2 Attacking with Partial Knowledge ‣ IV-C Attack Method ‣ IV Attacking Distance-aware Attack ‣ Semi-Targeted Model Poisoning Attack on Federated Learning via Backward Error Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span>2</span></a>).</p>

ADA succeeded in increasing the attack performance by 1.8 times when the attacking frequency is as low as 0.01 (Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="V-C Numerical Results ‣ V Experiments ‣ Semi-Targeted Model Poisoning Attack on Federated Learning via Backward Error Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-C</span></span></a>).</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is encountered with various types of adversarial attacks. Notably, as for poisoning attacks, an adversary usually compromises an FL system by manipulating either training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> or local training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> of an edge client. We briefly review related research efforts of poisoning attacks on FL in the following.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The goal of an adversary in a targeted poisoning attack on FL is to produce a poisoned local model update, such that after model aggregation particular inputs will induce misclassification of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In particular, label flipping is one type of poisoning attack, where a set of data’s labels are randomly flipped to a different class for malicious model training. For example, a semantic backdoor flips the labels of images with specific natural features to cause the misclassification with these features as triggers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, a malicious model update based on the label flipping usually yields a large norm of model weights compared to a benign update. To prevent the attacks from being easily detected by a norm-based defense algorithm in FL, Bagdasaryan et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> presented a train-and-scale technique that scaled the norm of a malicious update to the bound of the detecting algorithm. Whereas, this strategy could also result in degraded attack performance due to diminished poisoned model weights. Furthermore, the model replacement attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> aimed to completely replace the global model with a malicious adversary’s model. Notably, due to the converged global model resulting in a relatively small benign local update, an adversary-controlled client could upload a crafted malicious update that eventually replaced the global model after the aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Though the aforementioned targeted attacks aim to compromise an FL system, their attack performance typically depends on the assigned source class. There does not exist work on semi-targeted attacks that have a fixed source class and an adjustable target class. A semi-targeted attack tackles the problem that a poorly chosen target class for the assigned source class degrades the poisoning attack’s performance after the model aggregation in FL and even results in more easily discovered poisoning parameters. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study the semi-targeted poisoning attack with the consideration of generality in FL. In this regard, Shafahi et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> presented a feature-collision method aimed to generate similar-looking instances based on the source class such that their hidden features were close to the target class in a centralized setting. To mount the attack, the adversary needed prior knowledge about both the data distributions of the source class and the target class, which is different from our method with the federated setting where neither the data modification nor the prior knowledge about the target class’s data distribution is required. Furthermore, we studied poisoning attacks in FL with a more realistic setting regarding the attacking frequency, where the adversary had only a small possibility of participating in the training every round.</p>

The incorrectly predicted class can be the speed limit sign, the billboard, and so on.

For samples in the source class, by arbitrarily assigning a wrong label and computing the loss, FLAME measures the scale of the update required in the higher layer of the applied model. The update scale reveals the distance between the current model’s inner state of the latent feature representation and the poisoned model that misclassifies the input as the wrong label.</p>

In particular, if the update scale in the higher layer is large when assigning a specific class, the distance between the latent feature representations of the source class and the assigned class is assumed also large. In contrary, if the ground truth label is assigned, the update scale should be close to zero.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We applied a four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with architecture as follows: the first convolutional layer of the CNN model has a convolution kernel of size 5×5 with a stride of 1 and it takes one input plane and it produces 20 output planes, followed by a ReLU activation function; the second convolutional layer takes 20 input planes and produces 50 output planes and it has a convolution kernel of size 5×5 with a stride of 1, followed by ReLU; the output is flattened followed by a linear transformation of a fully connected layer, which takes as input the tensor and outputs a tensor of size 200; the final fully connected layer outputs a tensor of size 10 representing the 10 categories. Moreover, the categorical cross-entropy is employed to compute the loss. In addition, we apply as a learning function the Adam to update the model with a learning rate of 0.001.

Every round, FL randomly selected 10 clients to perform model training thus updating the global model based on the FedAvg. For the local model training, we employed an epoch of one and a batch size of 16. The evaluation was conducted every round after the global update based on the hold-out test set in the applied dataset. We mounted the attack after the global model converged showing no further decrease in the validation loss within the latest 10 rounds. Then the adversary performed ADA by measuring the AD from either the extracted latent feature representations in the full knowledge setting or the shared global model parameters using backward-error analysis in the partial knowledge setting. In addition, though the adversary can mount the attack before the global model converges, it will be less effective due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the AD between different classes.</p>

The final accuracy scores were measured by the maximum values within 50 rounds of FL. The results show that ADA outperforms the other methods with improved ATA and MTA scores when applying various attacking frequencies in all three classification tasks. ADA could achieve an ATA score of 0.387 in MNIST compared with the typical LF method with a score of 0.081 when the attacking frequency was 0.01 where a compromised client was selected around every 10 rounds. Moreover, the improvement of MTA in CIFAR-10 is larger than MNIST and Fashion-MNIST.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The experiments above are based on the assumption that the adversary has full knowledge of the classification task’s data distribution. On the contrary, in the partial knowledge setting, we assumed that the entire distribution of a compromised client’s local data is unknown to the adversary. The adversary only has access to the source class samples for mounting the attack. To measure the performance of ADA with partial knowledge, we performed the experiments using the same training hyper-parameters and setting. Instead of measuring the AD from the latent feature space, we leveraged the FLAME <a href="#S4.E13" title="In IV-C2 Attacking with Partial Knowledge ‣ IV-C Attack Method ‣ IV Attacking Distance-aware Attack ‣ Semi-Targeted Model Poisoning Attack on Federated Learning via Backward Error Analysis" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a> to mount the attack.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a semi-targeted model poisoning attack on federated learning (FL) called Attacking Distance-aware Attack (ADA). ADA aims to find the optimized target class by measuring the distance of latent feature representation between the source class and the target class. Moreover, in the more challenging partial knowledge setting, FLAME is leveraged to perform backward error analysis on the shared global model thus deducing attacking distances between different classes. Furthermore, we evaluated the proposed method’s performance against the metrics of ATA and MTA, with various attacking frequencies and classification tasks. The result showed that the semi-targeted ADA could increase the attack performance while retaining legitimate tasks’ performance in the various cases of FL. The goal is to introduce this new type of semi-targeted poisoning attack and reveal the risk. In future, a generator model that produces adversarial samples based on the revealed attacking distance information can be adopted to mount semi-targeted backdoors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> in FL. In addition, other defense strategies against the poisoning attacks in FL besides the norm-based methods will be further studied, such as the Byzantine-robust aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
