<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">The A.I. disruption and the need to compete on innovation are impacting cities that have an increasing necessity to become innovation hotspots. However, without proven solutions, experimentation, often unsuccessful, is needed. But experimentation in cities has many undesirable effects not only for its citizens but also reputational if unsuccessful. Digital Twins, so popular in other areas, seem like a promising way to expand experimentation proposals but in simulated environments, translating only the “half-baked” ones, the ones with higher probability of success, to real environments and therefore minimizing risks. However, Digital Twins are data intensive and need highly localized data, making them difficult to scale, particularly to small cities, and with the high cost associated to data collection. We present an alternative based on synthetic data that given some conditions, quite common in Smart Cities, can solve these two problems together with a proof-of-concept based on NO<sub id="id1.1.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub> pollution.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In 2011 Marc Andreessen wrote a seminal article in the Wall Street Journal, “Software is eating the World.” Today we can argue without exaggeration that Artificial Intelligence is eating software. This is increasingly true in cities. We have and are assisting in the process of city sensorization that brought in an abundance of data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous systems are being replaced by centralized command and control systems in areas as diverse as traffic management, garbage collection, pollution control, or even watering gardens. Satellites, drones, vision systems, and many others will undoubtedly increase this abundance and availability of real-time data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A consequence of this abundance of data realizes the old dream of a <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">City brain</span> taking shape. A City Brain is a centralized command and control structure that could optimize everyday life and adapt seamlessly to unexpected situations. This is, however, not the only consequence. We can also witness the increasing use of data for planning to evaluate potential scenarios and proposals. To the extreme, some talk about the redefinition of existing disciplines such as urbanism with urban data and data offices increasing in almost every major city.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Digital Twins have been evolving in aerospace exploration, manufacturing, and many other areas and, together with them, has been an evolution of their understanding, from models of specific characteristics of an artifact to digital shadows closely reflecting it or digital twins that allow the direct manipulation of the artifact through the digital twin. We can observe that the definition is evolving slowly in the Smart City community. Not only because a city is way more complex than a machine or an engineering artifact but also because planning, exploration, and deliberation are at the core of city management.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Two challenges that Digital Twins find in cities are the lack of complete data, particularly real-time data, and the need for scalability. Cities are large, grow and change constantly and have fuzzy borders. The idea of sensorizing a whole city is undoubtedly bold, difficult to attain, challenging to make it economically sound, and even more to keep it updated. In addition to that, cities are similar but also diverse. Thinking of an <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ad-hoc</span> development of digital twins for each town on our planet is unthinkable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We can observe that in many cities, we face discrete decisions, such as allowing truck traffic or not, let it in defined schedules (<span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g. </span>incl. or excl. school hours, weekends, …) or even closing the streets. Given this lack of granularity of the decisions, the precision of the digital twin must be tempered by its feasibility and cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduce “Deep Air,” a proof-of-concept prototype to provide some light on solving these two problems using machine learning and synthetic data. In synthesis, our prototype is a digital twin for city pollution built with synthetic data created by a calibrated machine learning model. We show that the accuracy of the prototype is enough for investigating pollution city policies and reactions to specific conditions, taking into consideration the low granularity of applicable procedures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">This proof-of-concept opens the door to a new generation of digital twins for cities using mixed data from real-time sensors and synthetic models. This approach will not only solve some of the problems of Smart City digital twins but also enable a model of decentralized self-regulated governance based on AI and synthetic data digital twins that we believe are endowed with higher agility, flexibility, scalability, and far lower cost while enabling Open, data-driven innovation in cities.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A digital twin is a virtual representation of the characteristics and behaviors of a physical entity used to study and predict its conduct without having to experiment with the actual object <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The concept of creating a digital duplicate of a system was practiced at NASA starting from the ’60s where one of the first accounts that we have of this practice was a model of Apollo 13 aimed at simulating the conditions on board in real-time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, aimed at avoiding the failure of the mission. The first crystallization of the concept was in the works of Michael Grieves, and Joan Vickers at NASA in 2003 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. It was redefined at NASA in 2012 as an integrated multiphysics, multiscale, probabilistic simulation of a system, which mirrors the life of a corresponding physical artifact based on historical data, physical model, and real-time sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since then, the concept of the digital twin has become popular <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, although with a diversity of approaches and understandings. These different understandings go from mimicking the complete functioning of a physical object, including the capacity to manipulate it through the digital twin, to a broader sense that emphasizes the ability to predict the future state of a system using AI and simulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This diversity of understandings has, among other causes, its roots in the variety of applications of digital twins, being prevalent in manufacturing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> because of its capacity and need for simulations. Similarly, they are even more common in the aerospace industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> because of the extreme cost difficulty of testing, even prototypes. Also, in the automotive industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, in smart grid studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> or even in socio-technical industries such as manufacturing plants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In general, as closely as the use of a digital twin is to a concrete physical object, the more precise its representation is. At the same time, when it applies to broader systems, particularly socio-economic and human interactions, they lean towards prediction and simulation more.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The case of using digital twins to model Smart Cities lies at the extreme. Cities are one of the most complex constructions of humankind, involving socio-economical, physical, urban, and human interactions. Digital twins in Smart Cities aim at modeling a fraction of these complexities through time and scale, allowing the experimentation of complex policies and their resulting behaviors in cities, something otherwise impossible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Smart Cities is probably today one of the most substantial areas of development of digital twins, not only in terms of projects being developed across the world in cities including Barcelona<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, Singapore, Helsinki, Boston, Glasgow, and many others, but in terms of broadening our understanding of what a digital twin can be.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Widespread experiments are on mobility and traffic behaviour under different scenarios and conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, more common scenarios involve planning (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>). Integrating traffic regulation systems such as City Brain in China facilitates the construction and use of these digital twins even more. On the same line, congestion pricing has also been popular because many cities must implement these systems to meet 2030 environmental commitments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">A systematic analysis of the literature on digital twins in Smart Cities reveals that applications relate to five different themes. Those are visualization, planning and predictions, situational awareness, and data management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. They also include four significant characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, mapping (modeling physical aspects of the city), virtual-real interaction (observation in the virtual environment of aspects of the physical one), software models (used for simulations and the own digital twin) and intelligent feedback (the analysis of policy effects either improving cities or potential signaling dangers) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, a primary constraint and trigger have been the massive sensorization of urban environments with IoT, the widespread connectivity in cities through 4/5G and Wifi, and the increased availability of detailed satellite imaging.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Historically, the dynamics of cities were understood with relatively high levels of abstraction from the perspective of its most extensive infrastructure and their significant impact on sustainability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Smart City digital twins heavily depend on an abundance of data, particularly real-time data, with fine granularity. This abundance of data does not correspond not only to the actual availability of sensors in cities but also to their foreseen implementation. Also, having the data does not imply being able to discover knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The availability of sensors is undoubtedly one of the most apparent limitations in digital twins in cities, but not the only one. For example, Los Angeles reports that daily, in 2019, they process 7.4 Terabytes of real-time data for four million citizens. Extracted from 4700 traffic signals, 23800 traffic sensors and 1500 bus signals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The central idea of our proposal is to use synthetic data. Therefore, data is created through an intermediary A.I.-based model to feed the digital twin together with real data from sensors and synthetic data (see Fig <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 The four challenges and limitations of Smart City Digital Twins ‣ 2 Materials and Methods ‣ The use of Synthetic Data to solve the scalability and data availability problems in Smart City Digital Twins" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, both data coming from sensors and external data will be the input of a machine learning model that will produce synthetic data for the digital twin. Again, this data and accurate data will feed the digital twin.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This model requires a loop of designing-test-refining for both the AI model and the digital twin to detect and correct data, model, or concept drifting. This is particularly important because the AI model introduces one more layer and, therefore, one more source of drifting and potential artifacts in the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The use of synthetic data will solve the problem of the scarcity of data. However, it could create another issue, the one of accuracy. We argue, however, that if the accuracy of the AI model supporting the digital twin is high enough and the granularity of the planning decision to be taken based on the data of the digital twin low enough, then there is a space where it will be no difference in terms of decisions between synthetic and real data.
To express it formally, the equality of decision proposition must be satisfied.

<p id="S2.SS2.p11.1" class="ltx_p">Of these two conditions, one is potentially under control, the accuracy of the model, while the other is case-dependent. On some occasions, decisions are significantly separated, for example, the case where the decision is allowing or not allowing truck circulation through a particular street. This will probably be the case in many public policy decisions related to physical infrastructure. In other cases, however, granularity will be more refined, such as the case of congestion taxes, requiring a higher accuracy of the model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p13.1" class="ltx_p">So far, we discussed data availability, which is the major challenge that faces today’s digital twins because increasing data availability implies increasing sensorization, which is not only costly, but lengthy in terms of deployment and, many times, difficult to substantiate in economic terms because of the low interest of remote sensors. However, this is not the only challenge around data. Data updating is also a significant challenge, particularly if real-time data is needed. Data updating, however, can be solved with an accurate machine learning model that provides synthetic data according to real, forecasted, or experimental conditions. In addition to that, a temporal model could fill the void between temporal sensor data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p15.1" class="ltx_p">Again, using a machine learning model as a first step can solve most of these problems. In the proof-of-concept that we present in the coming sections, we will show how a simple model based on external data and existing urban planning data can provide an accuracy high enough to enable a digital twin. Our system will provide accurate enough information leading to decisions indistinguishable from those that could have been taken from real data. The use of synthetic data together with existing and available features enables the high and fast scalability of the digital twin.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Pollution is one of the most critical problems that cities face. The influence of our lifestyle and urban structure on city pollution has been underlined during the COVID19 crisis. In Barcelona, for example, the NO<sub id="S3.SS1.p1.3.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub> levels dropped to unreachable levels for a long time; compared to everyday life, NO<sub id="S3.SS1.p1.3.2" class="ltx_sub">2</sub> levels were roughly 64% lower in March 2021. Multiple studies have shown that NO<sub id="S3.SS1.p1.3.3" class="ltx_sub">2</sub> pollution is associated with various diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, NO<sub id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub> pollution is contingent on many factors, many of them very local and time-dependent, such as traffic density, type of traffic, width of the streets, and, in general, the shape of an urban fabric built through centuries. The challenge to be addressed in this proof-of-concept model is, therefore to what extent is it feasible to create a model with limited data and enough accuracy to feed a digital twin for policy experimentation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This is undoubtedly difficult because of data locality, but this case can be generalized to other fields such as different types of pollution, mobility, congestion pricing, etc.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Air pollution is a structural problem that sometimes can be episodic. Today there are several ways to measure air pollution. Air pollution can be described through air stations - points with high accuracy - or satellites - e.g., S5p/troponin with 5 km resolution. It can also be characterized through simulations or Land Use Regressions models (LURs) - e.g., Lobelia/isglobal. However, all these methods have drawbacks in terms of low resolution (satellites), zonal indicators (air stations), or lack the urban complexity, which is a fundamental factor (LURs).
For this project, we have extracted data from multiple sources. Some data sets were publicly available, and others were given upon request.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Conclusions</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Undoubtedly, the need for better models for digital twins in cities is on the rise. Not only because of the complexity of cities and the growing performance expectations of citizens but also because of the speed and non-linearity of change that cities endure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For example, cities will face the arrival of autonomous cars in the coming years. After a few years of experimentation by Tesla and Google in Portland, where the service is active, we realized that this would not be a uniform, wide adoption, and rapid phenomenon. Instead, we will find an uneven adoption pattern with various technologies.
Therefore, more than ever, cities will need tools that can help them experiment with policy alternatives. Cities need new ways to perform the savvier digitization of their policies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, we are and will be far from the complete sensitization of cities, not only because of its feasibility in terms of the time needed to carry out the said project but also in terms of economic viability.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Digital twins, in their broad sense as digital models that could accurately represent certain aspects of a city, allowing for experimentation, planning, knowledge discovery - metadata will be a valuable asset- and even near real-time adjustments or emergency activation procedures, are part of the future of management, optimization and city planning. Metaphorically we can say that code is the new concrete <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, if digital twins use only real data, there are insurmountable barriers to availability, scalability, updating, and real-time response. Their modularization using future synthetic data plugins and opening as external experimentation tools could enable the open experimentation and collaboration that cities need.
Last but not least, we should also mention the environmental concerns of complete sensitization that could be lessened with this focus in the direction of green algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The proof of concept present in this work shows an alternative path that mixes real and synthetic data. We hope this research inspires a new generation of digital twins to support cheaper, more scalable, and open city management enabling open, data-driven innovation in cities.</p>
