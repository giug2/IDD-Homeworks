<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we address the emerging field of Streaming Federated Learning (SFL) and propose local cache update rules to manage dynamic data distributions and limited cache capacity. Traditional federated learning relies on fixed data sets, whereas in SFL, data is streamed, and its distribution changes over time, leading to discrepancies between the local training dataset and long-term distribution. To mitigate this problem, we propose three local cache update rules - First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Static Ratio Selective Replacement (SRSR), and Dynamic Ratio Selective Replacement (DRSR) - that update the local cache of each client while considering the limited cache capacity. Furthermore, we derive a convergence bound for our proposed SFL algorithm as a function of the distribution discrepancy between the long-term data distribution and the client’s local training dataset. We then evaluate our proposed algorithm on two datasets: a network traffic classification dataset and an image classification dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed local cache update rules significantly reduce the distribution discrepancy and outperform the baseline methods. Our study advances the field of SFL and provides practical cache management solutions in federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables a set of clients with decentralized data to collaborate and learn a shared model under the coordination of a centralized server. In FL, data is stored on edge devices in a distributed manner, which reduces the amount of data that needs to be uploaded and decreases the risk of user privacy leakage. While FL has gained popularity in the field of distributed deep learning, most research on FL has been conducted under ideal conditions and has not fully accounted for real-world constraints and features. Given that the client in FL is typically an edge device, we highlight two features that are more aligned with reality. The first feature, called <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Streaming Data</span>, acknowledges that clients often consist of edge devices that continually receive and record data samples on-the-fly. Therefore, FL must operate on dynamic datasets that are built on incoming streaming data, rather than static ones. The second feature, called <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limited Storage</span>, recognizes that edge devices such as network routers and IoT devices have limited storage space allocated for each service and application. As a result, only a restricted amount of space can be reserved for FL training without compromising the quality of other services. This paper aims to address the lack of consideration for these two real-world features in current FL research.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the problem presented above, we investigate a new FL problem, called Streaming Federated Learning (SFL), where the local models of clients are trained based on dynamic datasets rather than static ones. SFL involves three different types of data distributions. The first one is the long-term (underlying) label distribution, which pertains to the data distribution of the client following a prolonged period of streaming data reception. This distribution cannot be anticipated during the training process and, due to storage capacity constraints, it is unfeasible to obtain an accurate long-term distribution by recording the whole data stream. The second type is the short-term (empirical) label distribution, which corresponds to the distribution of the client’s currently received data. Short-term distributions are noisy and may vary over time, and they may not necessarily approximate the long-term distribution. The discrepancy between the long-term distribution and short-term distributions is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A System Model ‣ III Problem Formulation ‣ On the Local Cache Update Rules in Streaming Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The third type is the cached label distribution, which is the distribution of the dataset currently stored in the client and is governed by the local cache update rule. The aforementioned three distributions suggest that the primary challenge of SFL is the discrepancy between the a priori unknown long-term distribution and the distribution of cached data for training, as the training data is continually gathered from the stream. As a result, a proper local dataset update rule is essential to produce a cached distribution based on the short-term distributions so that it captures the long-term distribution as accurately as possible, thereby enhancing the learning performance. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, FL has emerged as a promising framework for decentralized deep learning. Several works, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, have provided a comprehensive introduction to FL and its research problems. Among the various challenges in FL, the convergence analysis of FedAvg and its variants stands out as particularly crucial. Early works focused on FL under the assumptions of i.i.d. datasets and full client participation, as demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Most of the theoretical works suggest that convergence occurs linearly given a sufficiently large number of learning rounds. However, this assumption may not always hold in real-world FL scenarios, leading to an increasing number of works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> investigating convergence proofs of FedAvg and its variants under non-i.i.d. datasets. Although the proposed SFL differs from conventional FL, our proof is primarily inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which is based on non-convex functions and non-i.i.d. datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring non-stationary and continually evolving local datasets that are known as concept drift problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Some researchers have begun to investigate the FL with concept drift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To address the concept drift problem under the FL setting, various approaches have been proposed, such as adjusting learning rates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, incorporating regularization terms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, or training multiple models separately <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, although SFL considered in our paper has some connection to the concept drift problem, there is a fundamental difference. In the SFL problem, the global objective function remains constant depending on the constant albeit unknown long-term label distribution. However, in the concept drift problem, the underlying distribution changes, leading to a change in the global objective function. Apart from the concept drift problems, two works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> consider a similar streaming data structure that is more relevant to our proposed SFL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors propose an online approach to control local model updates on streaming data and global model aggregations of FL, with the aim of preventing training load congestion after the preparation of the entire training data and ensuring that model training is spread out with the arrival of streaming data. Meanwhile, our study focuses on exploring the discrepancy between long-term label distribution and cached label distribution that arises from FL with streaming data and limited storage. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> introduce an online data selection framework for FL with streaming data. They aim to allow the server to exert control in a way that gradually regulates the data distribution of all clients to approach an i.i.d. distribution by facilitating additional information exchange between the server and the clients. However, in our work, we consider a more practical scenario where the clients themselves are responsible for data selection.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In terms of application, we applied SFL to online training of network traffic classifiers. Network traffic classification involves categorizing network traffic data into different types or classes based on certain characteristics of the data. There are two main categories of methods for performing network traffic classification: traditional methods and machine learning-based methods. Traditional methods mainly rely on port <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> or payload <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> traffic classification approaches. However, these methods can fail when faced with port translation or encrypted network packets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. With the growing popularity of deep learning, some recent approaches have utilized neural networks for traffic classification. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed FS-Net based on recurrent neural networks and autoencoder for traffic classification and packet feature mining. Another approach, described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, uses a DL-based autonomous learning framework for traffic classification, which can also handle unknown classes. Nonetheless, these approaches typically rely on centralized deep learning models, which may not be the optimal choice for distributed scenarios involving edge devices such as routers. Some recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> have suggested using the FL approach to address the issue of traffic classification. However, their proposed solutions do not take into account the gradual arrival of data in network traffic problems or the limited storage capacity of edge devices like routers.</p>

In our problem, we consider that labeled data packets continuously arrive at the routers depending on the application usage pattern in the LAN for training the DL-based network traffic classifier. The labeled data packets may be manually labeled with delay and the number is kept small relative to the total data traffic in order to reduce the labeling overhead and complexity. It is important to note that the network traffic classifier problem represents only one instance of the broader SFL problem. In utilizing the network traffic classifier problem to illustrate SFL, our aim is simply to aid the reader’s comprehension of the problem.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Because of the distributed nature of the network, it is impractical to send all the labeled data samples to a central location to train the model. Privacy concerns can also be another reason that forbids clients from directly exchanging data with each other. In this paper, we take the FL approach to train the machine learning model in a distributed manner assisted by a parameter server, where clients train local models based on their local data and periodically exchange the local models with a parameter server to derive the global model. However, compared to conventional FL systems where local models are trained on static local datasets, the online machine learning model must be trained on time-varying dynamic data. As the labeled data samples are received gradually over time at the clients, the clients do not have access to the long-term label distribution at the beginning but must continuously update their finite local cache for the incoming training instances. The cached label distribution in the local cache may diverge from the long-term label distribution because of the short-term non-stationarity, thereby degrading the FL performance.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The key difference between conventional FL and SFL is how the local model update is performed, specifically, what data the local model is trained on. In conventional FL, the local model is trained on a static local dataset (using either all data or sampled data) whereas in SFL, the local dataset must be continuously updated as new data is received and old data is removed. Therefore, the local cache update rule will affect what data is used for training local models and consequently the global learning performance.</p>

Our experiments are based on two datasets: FMNIST and the network traffic classification dataset (NTC) extracted from ISCXVPN2016 as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. FMNIST is a commonly used dataset for image classification tasks, while NTC is a specialized dataset for network traffic classification. It contains 45000 network packets that are divided into 10 classes, each representing a different application such as YouTube or Skype, which are encrypted traffic samples using various methods. The packet vectors can be reshaped to 39 × 39 bytes gray images. For both datasets, we use LeNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> as the backbone model, specifically modified according to the different datasets.

To simulate the time-varying short-term distributions, we generate 10 possible distributions for each client. In each time slot, the client receives one distribution as the short-term distribution. To capture the temporal correlation of the short-term distribution, the transition between any two short-term distributions is governed by a probability determined by the Kullback–Leibler (K-L) divergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> between these two label distributions. The probability of distribution transition between two distributions is higher when the K-L divergence between them is lower. The long-term distribution is obtained as the stationary distribution of these short-term distributions, based on the transition matrix, which is unknown to the client in advance.</p>

Several observations are made as follows. First, <span id="S6.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DRSR</span>, <span id="S6.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SRSR</span> and <span id="S6.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FIFO</span> outperform <span id="S6.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">LAZY</span> in terms of test accuracy and convergence speed, particularly in the later stages. <span id="S6.p5.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DRSR</span> and <span id="S6.p5.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SRSR</span> achieve performance close to <span id="S6.p5.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FULL</span> on the NTC dataset due to their ability to gradually approximate the long-term label distribution. Second, <span id="S6.p5.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DRSR</span> and <span id="S6.p5.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SRSR</span> outperform <span id="S6.p5.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FIFO</span> in the entire learning process, mainly attributed to their ability to retain the knowledge of past data streams. Third, the learning performance of <span id="S6.p5.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DRSR</span>, <span id="S6.p5.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">SRSR</span> and <span id="S6.p5.1.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">FIFO</span> is significantly better than <span id="S6.p5.1.15" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">LAZY</span> on the NTC dataset, while the performance gain is less significant on the FMNIST dataset.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our paper presents a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework named SFL, which differs from traditional FL by operating on a dynamic dataset. This dynamic nature of the data, coupled with the limited cache capacity on clients, results in discrepancies between the local training dataset and the long-term data distribution. We propose three update rules for the local cache update process in the SFL problem and provide a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental comparison to support our work. Future research will focus on developing more effective update rules for SFL to accelerate the training convergence speed and explore the potential of applying SFL to other practical scenarios.</p>
