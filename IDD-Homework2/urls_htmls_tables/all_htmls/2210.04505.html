<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has been proposed to protect data privacy and virtually assemble the isolated data silos by cooperatively training models among organizations without breaching privacy and security.
However, FL faces heterogeneity from various aspects, including data space, statistical, and system heterogeneity.
For example, collaborative organizations without conflict of interest often come from different areas and have heterogeneous data from different feature spaces. Participants may also want to train heterogeneous personalized local models due to non-IID and imbalanced data distribution and various resource-constrained devices. Therefore, heterogeneous FL is proposed to address the problem of heterogeneity in FL.
In this survey, we comprehensively investigate the domain of heterogeneous FL in terms of data space, statistical, system, and model heterogeneity.
We first give an overview of FL, including its definition and categorization.
Then, We propose a precise taxonomy of heterogeneous FL settings for each type of heterogeneity according to the problem setting and learning objective.
We also investigate the transfer learning methodologies to tackle the heterogeneity in FL.
We further present the applications of heterogeneous FL.
Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities and envision promising future research directions toward new framework design and trustworthy approaches.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In
the last decade, machine learning (ML) has achieved tremendous success and is widely applied to numerous areas, thanks to the surge of big data.
Despite the great success of ML, the broad application of ML is heavily restricted by the lack of large-scale datasets.
Moreover, the data collection and labeling can be expensive, making it infeasible for a single organization to collect enough data.
In other cases, although companies may already have sufficient data regarding the number of recordings.
They may want to enrich the feature space of their data by incorporating the auxiliary features distributed among other institutions.
However, sharing data between institutions or aggregating data from user devices leads to the risk of privacy leakage.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, concerns about data privacy protection have been emerging due to continuous privacy violations.
In response, information privacy policies and laws such as GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, and CCPA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> stipulate on sharing of data between companies to protect personal data from being abused.
Moreover, data also has enormous commercial values for companies. It is infeasible to transmit data out of privacy, security, and business concerns.
Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently leverage data distributed in multiple institutions for ML.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) was proposed to train ML models based on data distributed among clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In FL, intermediate results such as gradients are exchanged and aggregated to update models without raw data transmission.
Many efforts have been devoted to designing federated learning algorithms from various aspects, including privacy preservation, robustness, efficiency, security, scalability, and performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL faces a problem of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in FL comes from various aspects, including imbalanced data distribution, heterogeneous feature spaces, unstable network connectivity, and limited device resources.
We categorize the heterogeneity in FL into three types: <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data space, statistical, and system heterogeneity</span>.
All types of heterogeneity have attracted tremendous research interest in recent years.
To tackle the heterogeneity as mentioned above, various approaches that leverage <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model heterogeneity</span> are also widely explored, as heterogeneous models can help train tailored model architectures according to the feature space and device resources of parties.
Some surveys have focused on statistical heterogeneous FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and system heterogeneous FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Some works investigate the system design of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>
However, there is still a lack of comprehensive survey on all the above-mentioned heterogeneity in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle statistical heterogeneity, some works train a robust global model against the non-IID and unbalanced distributions in different participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Another approach is to train personalized local models for all parties by formulating the FL as multi-task learning problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Similarly, to tackle system heterogeneity, some approaches propose to efficiently build a single global model via client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, asynchronous aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and model compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. When different resource-constraint devices want to deploy a personalized local model, it is possible to train heterogeneous local models by model splitting and clustered training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Although most studies focus on statistical and system heterogeneity, the data spaces of different participants may differ as well.
In many real-world applications, the collaborating participants are organizations (e.g., banks or hospitals) from different industries without conflict of interest. Therefore, the collected data of each participant are from heterogeneous feature spaces.
For example, in advertisement scenarios, an advertiser holds users’ browsing history and clicking records, while a businesses hold the purchase history.
To leverage data from both feature spaces, the two parties must conduct data space heterogeneous FL to build a model on the joint feature space.
Such heterogeneity in data space brings new challenges to FL in various aspects.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">According to data space distribution, data space heterogeneous FL can be categorized into <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vertical federated learning</span> (VFL) and <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">heterogeneous federated transfer learning</span> (Hetero-FTL).
When data are partitioned by features, VFL aims to train a model on the aligned instances.
However, participants may share limited or no aligned instances and some common features in many cases.
Such overlap on feature space or instance space provides opportunities to transfer knowledge among parties.
Fortunately, federated transfer learning is proposed to adopt transfer learning to share knowledge among the participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. According to the shared data space among participants, we categorize Hetero-FTL into three cases: feature-sharing, instance-sharing, and label-sharing.
Compared to VFL, Hetero-FTL relaxes the requirement on instance alignment and improves the model availability.
We find that the data space heterogeneous FL, especially the Hetero-FTL is still under-explored and is a promising research direction that attracts increasing research interests.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We investigate the approaches to tackle different types of heterogeneity in FL. There are mainly five approaches to tackle heterogeneity: knowledge distillation, data augmentation, parameter sharing, domain adaptation, and matrix factorization.
For each approach, we discuss and review how to use them to address each type of heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">We also investigate the applications of heterogeneous FL in different areas, seeing it being actively promoted for industrial applications.
Furthermore, we conclude the major challenges and promising future directions in heterogeneous FL algorithm designing.

Parties with different feature spaces or label spaces can not train a shared model like traditional HFL.
Parties who share common instance IDs can leverage auxiliary features from other parties in training and inference processes.
In another case, parties without common instance IDs can explore to transfer knowledge from other feature spaces to boost the model performance in the training process. Heterogeneous FL techniques investigated in this survey aim to tackle data space heterogeneity via vertical and heterogeneous federated transfer learning.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The design of FL algorithms faces three major objectives: <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model performance (utility)</span>, <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">data privacy</span>, and <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">system efficiency</span>.
Improving one objective usually leads to the decline of other objectives.
Multiple factors can affect such a trade-off.
Here we identify six major factors in FL that affect the trade-off: model complexity (e.g., linear model, decision tree, neural networks), cryptographic privacy (e.g., HE, MPC), and obfuscation-based privacy (DP), sharing labels, asynchronization, and coordinator. We summarize the impact of each factor on the utility-privacy-efficiency trade-off in Table <a href="#S2.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ II-C Utility-Privacy-Efficiency Trade-off ‣ II An Overview of Federated Learning ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.
Generally speaking, model performance can be improved by increasing model complexity. Privacy can be improved by cryptographic or obfuscation-based approaches. Efficiency can be improved via sharing labels, asynchronization, and introducing a coordinator. We elaborate on each factor as follows.</p>

Although some research claims that there is <span id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">no free lunch</span> for the three objectives in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and optimizing one object leads to decline of other objectives, we can still optimize the objectives in two aspects.
1) First, we can identify the redundancy in the FL algorithms and reduce the redundant operations and communication delays as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Therefore, a newly proposed solution can <span id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dominate</span> previous FL algorithms in the utility-privacy-efficiency space.
2) Second, when the Pareto front is highly convex, we can find the <span id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">keen points</span> by proposing <span id="S2.SS3.SSS3.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">non-dominated</span> approaches to trade one objective with a little decline for another with significant benefit, thus achieve higher overall benefit.
For example, the CKKS scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> achieves higher computational efficiency with little or negligible utility decline via approximated decryption.

Homogeneous FL is widely applied in cross-device scenarios. The devices (e.g., IoT devices and mobile phones) independently collect private data sharing the same feature space and label space.
Since it was proposed, FL is meant to study the case where multiple clients holding homogeneous data train a single global model collaboratively under specific privacy constraints. Therefore, most existing researches focus on homogeneous FL.
Research on homogeneous FL can be categorized into two cases: <span id="S2.SS4.SSS1.p1.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">horizontal federated learning</span> and <span id="S2.SS4.SSS1.p1.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">homogeneous federated transfer learning</span>. The major difference is that, in HFL, there is one learning objective, and parties collaboratively train a global model on all data. However, in homogeneous federated transfer learning, each party optimizes its objective function and builds its model.
Data distribution in homogeneous FL can be summarized as follows:</p>

Different from HFL, which learns a single model for all parties even if the data is non-IID across different parties, homogeneous federated transfer learning aims to transfer knowledge from the other parties to some or each party.
Homogeneous federated transfer learning optimizes multiple objectives to achieve the best performance for each client with non-IID data. Therefore, homogeneous federated transfer learning is highly related to multi-task learning, personalization, and meta-learning. A variety of multi-model approaches are proposed to tackle the non-IID data problem.
We formulate the homogeneous federated transfer learning as:</p>

Heterogeneous FL is common in <span id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-silo settings</span> where organizations collaborate to leverage the heterogeneous features held by other parties for accurate prediction. Unlike cross-device settings where numerous devices, each with limited samples, collaborate to boost data size, parties in cross-silo settings generally hold a large dataset but are from different domains. Therefore, tackling the lack of features is of the key importance in cross-silo settings. Heterogeneous FL provides a promising approach to leveraging different features in different parties.
According to learning objectives and the distribution characteristics of the data spaces between parties, heterogeneous FL can be categorized into <span id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Vertical Federated Learning</span> and <span id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Heterogeneous Federated Transfer Learning</span>.</p>

Vertical FL enables different parties holding multi-view data partitioned by feature to collaboratively train machine learning models without exposing one’s own data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS4.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The active party first sends the user ID to all parties in the inference process. Then each party inputs their own features to the model and collaboratively predicts the result.
It is worth noting that if the user ID does not exist in all parties, the model inference can not be directly conducted without imputation. Therefore, the viability of the vertical federated model dramatically decreases as the number of parties increases due to the lack of sufficient linked training data and the hardness of alignment.</p>

Instead of collecting different features from separate parties to train a more accurate model, heterogeneous federated transfer learning aims to transfer knowledge from the heterogeneous data spaces in other parties to boost the performance of the local model.
Therefore, heterogeneous federated transfer learning releases the ID alignment requirement in vertical FL. When the inference data is not aligned between parties, the parties in heterogeneous FL can leverage the trained local model for inference. Since the model is trained by transferring knowledge from other parties, the model can achieve higher performance than that trained solely on local data.
In heterogeneous federated transfer learning, data can be linked in three ways.
1) parties have an overlap of ID space but no intersection of feature spaces.
2) parties have an intersection of feature space but no overlap of ID spaces.
3) parties have neither feature space overlap nor ID space overlap.

To our best knowledge, there is no survey investigate on data space heterogeneous FL, especially data space heterogeneous federated transfer learning.
To mitigate this gap, we deliver a comprehensive investigation on data space heterogeneity in Section <a href="#S3" title="III Data Space Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.

Such a setting is meaningful and practical in various cross-silo industrial applications, such as recommendation, advertisement, fraud detection, and credit extension. Unlike HFL, it allows non-competitive participants from different areas to cooperate with their unique features.
For example, a loan company with demographic features, an e-commercial company with customers’ purchase history, and an online video company with users’ movie browsing history can cooperate and leverage the heterogeneous features via vertical FL to boost the performance of credit extension business of the loan company.
According to the learning objectives and the distribution characteristics of the data spaces between parties, we categorize heterogeneous FL into <span id="S3.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Vertical Federated Learning</span> (VFL) and <span id="S3.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Heterogeneous Federated Transfer Learning</span> (Hetero-FTL), as demonstrated in Figure <a href="#S2.SS4" title="II-D A Categorization of Federated Learning ‣ II An Overview of Federated Learning ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-D</span></span></a>.

It addresses the data silos and privacy problems together.
The collaborating parties own data of the same set of users/instances but with disjoint features, and only one party holds the labels.
Taking the collaboration between a book recommender and an auxiliary data provider as an example, the intersection of their ID spaces is large. The book recommender records the consumer’s rating, browsing history, and item features, including book titles, authors, descriptions, and publishers. At the same time, an auxiliary data provider owns the demographic information such as age, phone number, location, and gender.
Their feature spaces are very different. Incorporating auxiliary user information helps the book recommender predict more precise recommendations. Therefore, the book recommender can collaborate with the auxiliary data provider to conduct VFL to train a model on the combination of the feature spaces of the two parties.

In practice, parties need to find the instance IDs that co-occur in all parties as training instances. Then, the shared instances are linked to form the <span id="S3.SS1.p2.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">training instances</span> of each party.
Exchanging instance IDs with other parties can leak membership information, which is not acceptable in VFL.
Privacy-preserving instance alignment allows different parties to find shared instances. Meanwhile, it protects the membership privacy of records or users.
We will introduce instance alignment in Section <a href="#S3.SS1.SSS1" title="III-A1 Private Instance Alignment ‣ III-A Vertical Federated Learning ‣ III Data Space Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span>1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The active party first sends the user ID to all parties in the inference process. Then each party inputs its features to the model and collaboratively predicts the result.
It is worth noting that if the user ID does not exist in all parties, the model inference can not be directly conducted without imputation. Therefore, the availability of the vertical federated model dramatically decreases as the number of parties increases due to the lack of sufficient aligned training data.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recall that instance alignment is essential in the data preprocessing phase of vertical federated model training.
If the instance IDs of training data are exchanged for instance alignment, one party can easily learn all membership information from the other, leading to severe privacy violations.
Delegating the instance alignment to an external party is also risky and infeasible in reality.
Privacy-preserving instance alignment techniques, such as Private Set Interaction (PSI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, and Private Entity Resolution (PER) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> can be applied to tackle this issue.
In PSI, separate parties compare encrypted versions of their sets to compute the intersection. Neither party reveals anything to the others except for the elements in the intersection.
For example, Bellare et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> introduce a keyed-hash message authentication code to encrypt the IDs for comparison.
PSI requires exact matching of identifiers among parties and is suitable for identifiers like phone numbers, national identification numbers, or social security numbers.
Nevertheless, instances can be linked by combining features with errors, such as name, birthday, and location.
PPRL and PER allow fuzzy matching that tolerates errors in the identifiers.
Schnell et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> adopt Bloom filters to perform fuzzy private record linkage on identifiers by computing string similarities.
Angelou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> implement a cross-platform, open-source library for asymmetric PSI and PSI-cardinality, which combines DDH-based protocols with compression based on Bloom filters to reduce communication in preprocessing.
Harty et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> utilize Cryptographic Longterm Key (CLK) to compute encrypted identifiers and use Dice coefficient to match instances.
After alignment, neither party knows the aligned instances except for an encrypted mask.
The training process with the encrypted ID mask is costly as all un-aligned instances should be used for training.
Since the instance alignment process is independent of the training process, participants can still dynamically align new data and add the aligned new data for training in the training process.</p>

Recently, many studies used decision trees to design algorithms for VFL.
This is because tree-based models are feasible to be adapted to VFL by nature.
Du et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite> first propose a decision tree for vertically partitioned data by using a scalar product protocol to compute information gained at a node. The labels are shared with all parties for training.
Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> also assume the labels in the training data could be shared with all parties, which is counterfactual in most real-world cases. They propose a secure decision tree construction trained in plain text by applying PSI.
Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite> leverage locality-sensitive hashing into vertical federated GBDT to protect the privacy of each party with relaxed privacy constraints.
Additive homomorphic encryption is adapted for privacy protection in several frameworks based on GBDT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
The work in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite> studies privacy-preserving federated vertical decision trees by proposing Pivot. Pivot provides protection against an honest-but-curious adversary without relying on any trusted third party based on threshold Paillier encryption and secret sharing. It identifies two privacy leakages of the plain-text trained model and proposes to use differential privacy and message authentication code to enhance the protocol. Pivot can also be extended to ensemble models such as random forest and gradient boost decision trees.
Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite> propose Federated Forest based on the CART tree and bagging. Each party stores the split information with respect to its own features. The proposed approach achieves comparable performance to the centralized version.
Fu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> designed an efficient vertical federated GBDT algorithm named VF2Boost, by proposing a concurrent training protocol and customized cryptographic operations to speed up homomorphic encryption.
Federated gradient boosting models sequentially build a boosting model with the base learner, which can be communication inefficient and time-consuming. Therefore, Han et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite> propose to integrate boosting and bagging to build multiple decision trees in parallel.
Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite> explore the interpretability in the inference phase for decision tree ensembles in VFL by canceling decision paths and adapting an efficient, secure inference method.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although VFL boosts model performance by aligning the features from isolated parties, it is hard to collect sufficient aligned data for training in the real world. On the other hand, VFL can not conduct inference on un-aligned test data.
Therefore, it is desirable to leverage the numerous un-aligned heterogeneous data for FL and inference on un-aligned test data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Heterogeneous federated transfer learning (Hetero-FTL) aims to transfer knowledge from the heterogeneous feature spaces of other parties to boost the performance of the local model.
Hetero-FTL relaxes the ID alignment requirement in VFL, and transfers the knowledge of the un-aligned training data to other parties to improve the performance of their local models.
When the test data are not aligned among all parties, the parties holding features can leverage the local model trained in Hetero-FTL for inference.
Since the model is trained by transferring knowledge from other parties, the model can achieve higher performance than that trained solely on local data.</p>

Faced with the fact that most instances can hardly be aligned across multiple parties in the real world, it is desirable to collaboratively train ML models with limited aligned data and no common features.
Instance-sharing Hetero-FTL is a promising relief from the stringent restriction on data alignment in VFL.
As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ III-B1 Instance-sharing Hetero-FTL ‣ III-B Heterogeneous Federated Transfer Learning ‣ III Data Space Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, a recommender A wants to build a recommendation system with the help of an auxiliary data provider B. The recommender A holds the user’s rating, browsing history, and item features such as price, category, color, etc. At the same time, the auxiliary data provider B holds the demographic information, including occupation, education, gender, etc.
The recommender and the data provider have a part of users in common. These common users can be aligned by privacy-preserving instance alignment <a href="#S3.SS1.SSS1" title="III-A1 Private Instance Alignment ‣ III-A Vertical Federated Learning ‣ III Data Space Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span>1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The recommender aims to boost the performance of the recommender system by leveraging the data from the auxiliary data provider in a privacy-preserving way.
Since only limited aligned users are in training data, VFL cannot achieve high accuracy and cannot be applied to un-aligned test data.
The instance-sharing Hetero-FTL helps build a better recommender system by making full use of all data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In feature-sharing Hetero-FTL, different parties have some features in common. However, the ID spaces are disjoint. Thus the data samples cannot be aligned across parties. We show the data distribution in feature-sharing Hetero-FTL in Figure <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ III-B2 Feature-sharing Hetero-FTL ‣ III-B Heterogeneous Federated Transfer Learning ‣ III Data Space Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.
To transfer knowledge to the active parties, the shared common features can be used as a pivot to bridge knowledge from different domains.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Just as instance-sharing Hetero-FTL is an extension of vertical FL by leveraging un-aligned private data for model training,
feature-sharing Hetero-FTL can also be considered as an extension of HFL by taking advantage of private local features for model training.
Before federated training, all parties first find co-existing features.
During model training, each party locally trains a compact model with all local features as input.
In FL, different parties aggregate the model parameters of the common features and compute an aggregated model.
Therefore, the knowledge is transferred among parties via the aggregation of the parameters of common features.</p>

The federated recommendation system is a typical application scenario of feature-sharing Hetero-FTL.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ III-B2 Feature-sharing Hetero-FTL ‣ III-B Heterogeneous Federated Transfer Learning ‣ III Data Space Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, a transnational e-commercial company aims to build a recommendation system with user-item interaction data collected from two countries. It is infeasible to exchange raw data among parties subject to legal constraints.

Since the two parties share the same item features, the model weights of item features can be aggregated when training a federated recommendation system.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly, in another scenario, two recommenders may share the same set of users but own different items.
For example, a movie recommender and a book recommender in the same country collaboratively build recommendation systems with common users.
The user features are shared and thus can be used to transfer knowledge between recommenders.
Some existing work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite> categorize the first user-sharing federated recommendation as HFL and the second item-sharing federated recommendation as VFL.
However, Gao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite> denote that both federated recommendation scenarios are the same in feature space and are typical feature-sharing Hetero-FTL problems.</p>

There are mainly three types of transfer learning approaches used to tackle feature-sharing Hetero-FTL problems, including data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite>, parameter sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>]</cite>, and collaborative filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>]</cite>.
Linear models and collaborative filtering approaches are widely explored to tackle the feature-sharing Hetero-FTL problem.
Most practical algorithms are designed and implemented for federated recommendation, which is the major application scenario in the feature-sharing Hetero-FTL problem. However, deep models and three-based models are still under-explored in feature-sharing Hetero-FTL.
We elaborate on these approaches in Section <a href="#S7" title="VII Apply Transfer Learning to Tackling Statistical, Data Space, System and Model Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>.</p>

There are mainly two types of transfer learning approaches used to tackle the label-sharing Hetero-FTL issue: 1) parameter sharing, 2) knowledge distillation. We denote that these strategies can be combined to boost performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">85</a>, <a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>]</cite>.
Although there are only a few works explicitly study label-sharing Hetero-FTL, some recent studies on <span id="S3.SS2.SSS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">system heterogeneity</span> in FL could be adapted to label-sharing Hetero-FTL problems, as they propose to train a heterogeneous local model architecture for each party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>, <a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>, <a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">85</a>, <a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>]</cite>.
We elaborate these approaches in Section <a href="#S7" title="VII Apply Transfer Learning to Tackling Statistical, Data Space, System and Model Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We summarize the utility-privacy-efficiency trade-off of the reviewed studies in data space heterogeneous federated transfer learning (Hetero-FTL) in Table <a href="#S3.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ III-B4 Summary ‣ III-B Heterogeneous Federated Transfer Learning ‣ III Data Space Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>. We also list some related works proposed for Non-FL settings that can be modified to tackle data space heterogeneity.
It can be observed that each aspect of Hetero-FTL is still under-explored. Most existing studies emphasize model performance (utility) and efficiency more than privacy, as they prefer to train plain-text neural networks without a rigorous privacy guarantee. Many of them were initially proposed to tackle system heterogeneity.
Therefore, it is desirable to explore tailored Hetero-FTL algorithms with stringent privacy protection.</p>

We identify four transfer learning strategies to address critical Hetero-FTL challenges, including data augmentation, parameter sharing, knowledge distillation, and matrix factorization.
We find representation learning and knowledge distillation are popular strategies to transfer knowledge among parties and are widely used in all types of Hetero-FTL problems.
For neural network models, each party builds a local model to map their feature space into a common latent subspace.
For linear models, learning a linear mapping can map the feature representation between parties or to a common subspace via concept factorization.
Knowledge distillation is still under-explored, especially in feature-sharing Hetero-FTL. Some of the listed KD approaches were proposed for system-heterogeneous FL and are not tailored to Hetero-FTL. Therefore, it is desirable to develop KD-based approaches to tackle Hetero-FTL problems.
Collaborative filtering approaches such as matrix factorization and factorization machines are also explored for federated recommendation applications, as the federated recommendation is a feature-sharing Hetero-FTL problem by nature.
We will introduce the studies using these transfer learning approaches to tackle data space heterogeneity in Section <a href="#S7" title="VII Apply Transfer Learning to Tackling Statistical, Data Space, System and Model Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The non-IID data among parties leads to poor global model convergence and a lack of solution personalization. These issues deteriorate the performance of the global model on each participant and could also disincentives the participants from participating in the FL.
To tackle the non-IID issue, transfer learning approaches have attracted tremendous research interest in recent years.
There are mainly two strategies to tackle statistical heterogeneity in FL. 1) Train a global model with good generalizability, then each party fine-tunes the pre-trained global model on its local dataset. 2) Directly train personalized models for all parties.</p>

However, the marginal distribution or conditional distribution may differ among different parties.
Since it was proposed, FL is meant to study the case where multiple clients holding homogeneous data aim to train a single global model collaboratively under specific privacy constraints. Therefore, most existing researches focus on data space homogeneous FL.
Research on data space homogeneous FL can be categorized into two cases: horizontal FL (HFL) and homogeneous federated transfer learning (Homo-FTL).
The major difference is that, in HFL, there is one learning objective, and parties collaboratively train a global model on all data. HFL tackles the statistical heterogeneity by training <span id="S4.p3.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a single global model</span>.
However, in Homo-FTL, each party optimizes its objective function and builds its model, and the statistical heterogeneity is tackled by training <span id="S4.p3.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized models</span> for all parties.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To improve communication efficiency, Reisizadeh et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib106" title="" class="ltx_ref">106</a>]</cite> propose to use periodic averaging and quantization to reduce data transmission.
Wang et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib107" title="" class="ltx_ref">107</a>]</cite> propose CMFL to preclude the irrelevant updated by clients.
Konecny et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite> propose structured updates and sketched updates, which learn updates from a restricted space and compress the learned updates, respectively.
For privacy preservation, differential privacy has been intensively studied in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>, <a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>, <a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">111</a>]</cite> to protect client-side privacy.
Homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation are also adopted for secure model training and aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>, <a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, data in HFL can be 1) non-IID, 2) unbalanced, and 3) massively distributed, which eliminates the model performance. The non-IID issue is common as each client corresponds to a particular user, a location, or a time window. For example, in the virtual keyboard application, users who live in the UK and the USA speak English differently; thus, the conditional probability varies.
To tackle the non-IID problem, many approaches have been proposed to mitigate the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>]</cite>.
For example, Jeong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite> proposed federated distillation and federated augmentation for communication efficient FL on non-IID data. A generative model is trained to augment each party’s local data towards yielding an IID dataset.
Lin et. al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite> introduced ensemble distillation for robust model aggregation on non-IID data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">Different from HFL, which learns a single model for all parties even if the data is non-IID across different parties, Homo-FTL aims to transfer knowledge from the other parties to some or each party.
Homo-FTL optimizes multiple objectives to achieve the best performance for each client with non-IID data. Therefore, Homo-FTL is highly related to multi-task learning, personalization, and meta-learning. A variety of multi-model approaches are proposed to tackle the non-IID data problem.
We formulate the Homo-FTL as:</p>

Huang et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite> employ federated attentive message passing to facilitate similar clients to collaborate more and enable each client to own a local, personalized model.

Devices may differ in hardware (CPU, GPU, memory), network connectivity (WiFi, 4G, 5G), and power supply (battery mode), which leads to various computation, communication, and storage capabilities.
Such heterogeneity of resource-constrained devices brings multiple challenges to FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>:</p>

To select the maximum possible number of clients, a greedy algorithm is proposed, where the clients taking the least time for local training are selected interatively.
Yoshida et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> further propose Hybrid-FL to handle non-IID data distributions among clients. During the client selection phase, the devices are selected to form an approximately IID dataset.

SAFA classifies clients into three types: up-to-date, deprecated, and tolerable. The first two types of clients update models in a synchronous manner, and the last type of client update models in an asynchronous manner.

The number of parameters in smaller models are reduced in width by cropping each parameter matrix of the largest model into sub-matrix with various reduction radio.
With this construction, HeteroFL adaptively allocates subsets of global model parameters to each party according to its corresponding capabilities.
To perform aggregation, each parameter is averaged from the parties whose local models contain that parameter.
However, this approach is not beneficial for retaining large models’ knowledge in smaller models because the width pruning operation breaks the original model structure.
Moreover, even the same sub-matrix may have different behaviors in the small and large models due to the model structure differences, which may lead to a sub-optimal performance due to the mismatch of feature spaces.
In addition, simply sharing parts of parameters across different models cannot effectively transfer useful knowledge encoded by strong models to other weaker models.
To tackle the above issue, Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib153" title="" class="ltx_ref">153</a>]</cite> further propose InclusiveFL, in which the shallow bottom model layers in the largest model are shared with other smaller local models, to eliminate the mismatch between small and large local models.</p>

During training, strong parties sample more base models for local training and weak parties sample less base models. In each communication round, the server aggregates each base model using the updates from the corresponding parties.
In inference phase, the trained local models can be aggregated on-demand according to inference requirements.

In FedMask, each party learns a heterogeneous and structured sparse neural network. To achieve this, each party learns a sparse binary mask while freezing the parameters of local model. Only the binary masks are communicated between devices and the server.
The model aggregation is conducted by averaging on the unmasked parameters for each local model.
The authors of FedMask also propose a similar approach named Hermes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib155" title="" class="ltx_ref">155</a>]</cite> that trains personalized and sparse neural networks by applying the structured pruning.

The mobile devices are trained in a hierarchical way. Specifically, the devices in each cell first conduct FL by base stations. Then, the models trained within each cell are periodically aggregated via a macro base station to mutually transfer knowledge among the base stations.
Similarly, Chai et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib158" title="" class="ltx_ref">158</a>]</cite> proposed a tire-based client selection approach that groups clients according to communication delay.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different parties may hold heterogeneous features and various device resources in FL. Therefore, it is desirable to train heterogeneous models for participants accordingly.
However, averaging-based model aggregation algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> are not valid in such settings due to the infeasibility of parameter matching among local models.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The requirement of <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model heterogeneity</span> in FL comes from three aspects: data space, statistical, and system heterogeneity.
1) For data space heterogeneous FL where the feature spaces differ among different parties, each party must train a heterogeneous local model taking data from different feature spaces as input for label prediction.
For example, in healthcare applications, a hospital has medical image data such as CT and MRI, and another has tabular medical record data. They may cooperate to do VFL by training a CNN model for medical images and a decision tree model for tabular data.
2) For statistical heterogeneous FL, parties can train heterogeneous local models to tackle non-IID and imbalanced data.
3) For system-heterogeneous FL, the participating devices or edges may have different constraints regarding performance, computation, and communication. The participants desire to tailor their own model architectures.
For example, we can train human activity recognition models on smartphones and wearable devices. Smartphones have powerful computation resources. However, wearable devices collect more accurate movement data but have fewer computation resources.
Therefore, we can train larger models for smartphones and lightweight models for wearable devices.
In summary, training heterogeneous local and global models is a critical technique to tackle the three heterogeneity issues in FL.</p>

<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are many approaches proposed to train heterogeneous models. When different parties have heterogeneous features such as VFL, it is natural to build a specific model for each feature space. The different models can be integrated into one model or aggregated for prediction.
As a representative type of model compression, knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib162" title="" class="ltx_ref">162</a>, <a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">163</a>]</cite> adopts a "teacher-student" learning paradigm to learn a small model from a large teacher model effectively.
Knowledge distillation relaxes the stringent requirement of homogeneous local models as it takes the logits as representations for knowledge transfer, providing an approach to building FL systems with heterogeneous model architectures.</p>

Finally, the decomposed matrices are sent back to all clients to remove the random transformation.
The decomposed matrices contain a shared matrix and a private matrix. For VFL, the shared matrix contains latent representations for heterogeneous features of each sample. While the private matrix is the personalized local model that maps heterogeneous feature spaces to the common latent space.</p>

Three forms of knowledge can be leveraged to transfer knowledge from the teacher model to the student model: response-based knowledge, feature-based knowledge, and relation-based knowledge.
Both response-based and feature-based knowledge leverage the output of specific layers to transfer knowledge from teacher to student.
Relation-based knowledge takes the instance-wise or layer-wise distance as knowledge to train the student model.

The teacher prediction updates all local models together with the ground truth of private labeled data.
Taking a two-party instance-sharing Hetero-FTL problem as an example, two parties first locally train heterogeneous student models with their private data in different feature spaces.
Then, they can use mutual knowledge distillation to update two local models over the aligned instances collaboratively.
In mutual knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>]</cite>, two student models learn from each other by taking the logits from the other model as soft targets.</p>

Although this approach is proposed for centralized learning, it can be modified to tackle data space heterogeneity.
Since each party trains a compact local model, the active party can conduct inference by ensemble aggregation with an arbitrary number of aligned parties. The active party can use its local model for inference to predict unaligned test data. On the other hand, when the test data is aligned across several parties, all parties with aligned features collaboratively predict with the ensemble of local models.

Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>]</cite> first study the problem of secure federated transfer learning in the instance-sharing Hetero-FTL setting. They assume two parties holding heterogeneous features have limited aligned instances. They first train two neural networks to map two feature spaces into a common latent subspace to transfer knowledge from a source party to a target party. Then, the two parties conduct HFL to train a neural network model to map the latent subspace to the label space. Additive HE and secret sharing are incorporated into the training algorithm to protect data privacy. The secure approach provides the same level of accuracy as the plain-text method.
As a further improvement, Sharma et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>]</cite> leverage a more efficient secure computation framework named SPDZ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib172" title="" class="ltx_ref">172</a>]</cite> for efficient training.
Kang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite> propose a semi-supervised learning approach that uses limited aligned instances to boost the model performance of each party. This approach estimates representations for missing features, predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples to expand the training set, and trains three classifiers jointly based on different views of the expanded training set to improve the VFL model’s performance. Neither raw data nor model parameters are transmitted between parties to protect data privacy.
He et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>]</cite> propose FedHSSL, a federated hybrid semi-supervised learning framework to fully use all available data (including un-labeled and un-aligned) data for training. FedHSSL exploits generic feature representations shared among different feature spaces to boost the
performance of the joint model via partial model aggregation. In FedHSSL, each party has a two-tower structured model. One sub-model is trained on aligned data for supervised representation learning; the other is trained on un-labeled data via self-supervised learning.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Instead of learning feature representations in a common latent subspace, it is also possible to directly learn a mapping from one feature space to another.
Hou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>]</cite> consider a centralized setting and study the problem of learning with feature evolution in a data stream, where all old features in the data stream vanish unpredictably, and new features emerge simultaneously.
During the feature evolution, there is an overlapping period in which, for each data sample, the old features gradually vanish, and new features appear.
The authors first use least squares to learn a mapping from the new feature space to the old one. Therefore, the knowledge of the previous model can be transferred to the new feature space.
Ensemble learning is leveraged to use both the old and new features without manually deciding which base models should be incorporated.
Instead of transferring knowledge to a new feature space in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>]</cite>, instance-sharing Hetero-FTL requires knowledge transfer between different feature spaces.</p>

Several transfer learning approaches proposed for non-FL settings can be adopted to tackle the feature-sharing Hetero-FTL problem.
Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>]</cite> study heterogeneous transfer learning in image classification by leveraging documents and tags as auxiliary data. The tags are shared features that transfer knowledge between image and text space via collective matrix factorization.
As a related non-FL approach, ReForm is proposed by Ye et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite> to reuse a previous model by rectifying via heterogeneous predictor mapping.
Each party locally trains a mapping from shared features to local features as feature meta representation (meta-feature) of the local features. Then, a mapping between the meta-features is trained to convert the model parameters of one local feature space to the model parameters of the other local feature space.
However, this approach only applies to scenarios with a few overlapped features and makes multiple assumptions about the data distribution.</p>

In label-sharing Hetero-FTL, participants have neither feature in common nor aligned instance ID, and they only have the same label space, as shown in figure <a href="#S3.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ III-B3 Label-sharing Hetero-FTL ‣ III-B Heterogeneous Federated Transfer Learning ‣ III Data Space Heterogeneity ‣ A Survey on Heterogeneous Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
When the heterogeneous feature spaces from different parties are similar, all parties can leverage representation learning to train local models to map their local feature space to a common latent subspace. Then, a shared model can be collaboratively trained to map the feature representations in the latent subspace to the label space.
Ju et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite>, and Gao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite> propose a neural network-based framework to tackle heterogeneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal classification. Clients use different devices to collect EEG signals from heterogeneous feature spaces in their settings. Moreover, they aim to train federated models to predict the same task.
To transfer knowledge among clients, they train a neural network model for each client to map heterogeneous features to a low-dimensional symmetric positive definite manifold. To align all heterogeneous samples in each class in the reduced manifold, they adapt maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib173" title="" class="ltx_ref">173</a>]</cite> as a constraint.
Then, they train a neural network via federated aggregation to map the manifold to the label space.
Gao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite> further consider that different groups of clients share the same feature space, and all groups of clients collaboratively map their heterogeneous features into a common manifold by training a unique manifold reduction layer in each group. Then, all clients conduct HFL to train a federated layer for prediction.
Liang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">85</a>]</cite> harnessed representation learning to handle heterogeneous data and efficient global model updates. The feature representations can be learned via local supervised learning, unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning, or fair representation learning.</p>

The parameter sharing approaches can conduct either 1) representation learning by sharing the bottom layers or 2) multi-task learning by sharing the top layers with the global model.
In representation learning approaches, all parties learn personalized bottom layers as feature extractors and collaboratively train a global model for prediction.
Singhal et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite> proposed federated reconstruction based on model-agnostic meta-learning for partially local FL suitable for training and inference at scale.

The number of parameters in smaller models are reduced in width by cropping each parameter matrix of the largest model into sub-matrix with various reduction radio.
With this construction, HeteroFL adaptively allocates subsets of global model parameters to each party according to its corresponding capabilities.
To perform aggregation, each parameter is averaged from the parties whose local models contain that parameter.
However, this approach is not beneficial for retaining large models’ knowledge in smaller models because the width pruning operation breaks the original model structure.
Moreover, even the same sub-matrix may have different behaviors in the small and large models due to the model structure differences, which may lead to a sub-optimal performance due to the mismatch of feature spaces.
In addition, simply sharing parts of parameters across different models cannot effectively transfer useful knowledge encoded by strong models to other weaker models.

In matrix factorization, the item features are trained jointly with the user features over private user-item interaction data.
To conduct secure FedMF, the item features are encrypted by homomorphic encryption (HE) and transmitted to the recommendation system for aggregation. After aggregation, the item features are sent back to all users for local training.
Ammad et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite> proposed the federated collaborative filtering (FCF) method, which is similar to FedMF.

In PrivRec, the clients locally store private user-item interaction data, and the recommender system server has public point-of-interest data about the items.
For the linear model part, the parameters corresponding to user features remain on the client-side and are specific to each client.
The linear model parameters corresponding to item features are the same across all clients.
To protect user privacy, secret-sharing and local differential privacy are used to train the linear model.
To train the feature interaction model, PrivRec sends all user features and item features to the recommender for aggregation.
However, Gao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> proved that the aggregation strategy used in federated FM might cause model leakage and user information leakage.
Moreover, user-item interaction data is highly sparse, and secret-sharing converts sparse data into a dense matrix, making the existing accelerating approaches in plain-text data infeasible.
To further improve the privacy against the model inversion attack and the data reconstruction attack in federated FM, Gao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> proposed FedFM by combining the secret-sharing and HE for secure feature interaction.

We highlight the under-explored areas in red rectangles.
The five transfer learning approaches can be grouped into three perspectives.
The data-based strategy includes the data augmentation approaches. The architecture-based strategies include parameter sharing, knowledge distillation, and domain adaptation approaches.
The model-based strategy includes matrix factorization approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We find parameter sharing (representation learning) and knowledge distillation are the most widely used approaches to transfer knowledge among parties and are widely used to address all types of heterogeneity.
Knowledge distillation is still under-explored in Hetero-FTL.
Some of the listed KD approaches were proposed for system-heterogeneous FL and are not tailored to Hetero-FTL. Therefore, it is desirable to develop KD-based approaches to tackle Hetero-FTL problems.
Matrix factorization approaches are also explored for federated recommendation applications, as the federated recommendation is a feature-sharing Hetero-FTL problem by nature.
However, matrix factorization approaches are still under-explored to tackle statistical and system heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S8.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The federated recommender system is one of the hottest research topics among the applications of FL, where the data distribution is heterogeneous by nature.
Federated recommender systems can be categorized into three types regarding the data partition among the participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite>.
In vertical federated recommender systems, all participants hold heterogeneous model parameters, which are required for model inference.
In federated transfer recommender systems, the user-item interaction matrix is generally partitioned by users or items. Participants share some parameters, while each has its own model parameters.
When all participants share the same user-item interaction matrix, though rarely happens in reality, HFL can be conducted to learn the user-item profiles.
We denote that some works categorize federated recommender systems into horizontal and vertical regarding the partitioning of user-item interaction matrix by users and by items, respectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib175" title="" class="ltx_ref">175</a>]</cite>.</p>

In <span id="S8.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-device settings</span>, users’ mobile devices are taken as clients. In contrast, the recommender holds a server for federated model aggregation.
Most existing researches are based on collaborative filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib176" title="" class="ltx_ref">176</a>, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>, <a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite>.
Generally, each mobile device represents a user and trains its local user profile on its local data. The item profiles are updated by each user and sent to the server.
After receiving the item profiles from numerous mobile devices, the recommender server conducts model aggregation to update the global item profiles. Therefore, the model aggregation is

The user-item data distribution can be vertical, where each collaborating vendor offers a different subset of items to the same underlying population of users. In such a case, the knowledge is transferred by collaboratively training the user profile.
Otherwise, the data distribution is horizontal with different subsets of users.
Shmueli and Tassa  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib175" title="" class="ltx_ref">175</a>]</cite> designed a secure distributed item-based CF approach based on HE. A mediator is introduced to perform intermediate secure computations yielding reduced communication costs.
Polat and Du <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib178" title="" class="ltx_ref">178</a>]</cite> focus on the case of two vendors with binary user-item data. They show how to offer recommendations in different distribution scenarios without deep privacy violations. Yakut and Polat <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib179" title="" class="ltx_ref">179</a>]</cite> studied item-based predictions on two e-commerce sites with arbitrarily distributed data.

This setting is asymmetric, where the auxiliary data provider does not benefit at all from the collaboration. For example, Jeckmans <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib180" title="" class="ltx_ref">180</a>]</cite> adopted Prillier’s HE scheme to leverage data from one company to improve the recommendation performance of the other company.

<div id="S8.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There exist various challenges in federated recommender systems. First, data is sparse in recommender systems compared to other applications. Many existing privacy-preserving approaches adopt HE and SMC to protect data privacy by encrypting the user-item interaction matrix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="" class="ltx_ref">83</a>]</cite>.
However, since the user-item interaction matrix is sparse, the information is encoded in the entry index such as (user_id, item_id).
To prevent privacy leakage, existing approaches encrypt all entries and update the full encrypted matrix for model training and aggregation, which causes impractically low efficiency.
Therefore, developing sparse data-friendly algorithms in privacy-preserving federated recommendation settings is desirable.</p>

<div id="S8.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">VFL trains model over the aligned data. However, the in-aligned labeled data is not considered by existing VFL approaches. The vertical federated model can not evaluate the un-aligned instances.
In the inference phase, the recommender must first align the instance and decide to use the vertical federated model or the local model.
Such a two-step process is time-consuming and fails to transfer knowledge between the vertical federated model and the local model.
Therefore, finding a privacy-preserving FL approach is essential to enable both parties to build a high-performance model that leverages all heterogeneous features and labeled instances for model training.</p>

Financial risk control suffers from dataset insufficiency, skewed distribution, and limitation of detection time. Moreover, due to data privacy and security, different financial institutions are not allowed to share their datasets. Researchers explored using cross-silo FL to tackle such challenges.
Zheng <span id="S8.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib182" title="" class="ltx_ref">182</a>]</cite> proposed a federated meta-learning model for fraud detection, where a shared whole novel meta-learning-based classifier is constructed by FedAvg.

<p id="S8.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Medical healthcare is one of the major application directions of FL. Most existing works consider horizontally partitioned medical data among different hospitals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib185" title="" class="ltx_ref">185</a>, <a href="#bib.bib186" title="" class="ltx_ref">186</a>, <a href="#bib.bib187" title="" class="ltx_ref">187</a>]</cite>. For example, Brisimi <span id="S8.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> developed a decentralized support vector machine to predict hospitalizations for patients with heart diseases.
Some works investigate FL with heterogeneous data distribution. Heterogeneous federated transfer learning (Hetero-FTL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>]</cite> is proposed to transfer knowledge between participants sharing common features and is studied in in-hospital mortality prediction.
Hetero-FTL is suitable for healthcare applications where data deficiency and privacy are critical challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In healthcare, equipment differences may also cause data heterogeneity. For example, Gao <span id="S8.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite> noticed that different electroencephalographic (EEG) devices might differ in electrode number, position, and sampling rate. Therefore, EEG data collected by different devices may not be directly used in FL. A hierarchical heterogeneous horizontal federated learning (HHHFL) approach is proposed to address the data heterogeneity challenge in EEG data. A federated transfer learning approach is designed later to improve the knowledge transfer performance in EEG data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite>.
Data heterogeneity broadly exist in healthcare applications due to the divergence of medical device and the multi-modality of medical records. Therefore, more efforts should be devoted to solving the challenge of heterogeneous FL.</p>

<p id="S9.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In heterogeneous FL settings, averaging-based model parameter aggregation techniques could become infeasible as the model architecture varies for heterogeneous feature spaces.
Recently, representation learning has been used to learn common feature representations from different feature spaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>, <a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>, <a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite>. This line of study aims to convert Hetero-FTL into horizontal homogeneous FL by training a feature space-specific sub-model for each party. In this way, averaging-based model aggregation can be applied to train a global feature classifier to map the intermediate features to the label space.
For the multi-active party settings, many studies explore to transfer knowledge in label space via knowledge distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib88" title="" class="ltx_ref">88</a>, <a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>]</cite>. However, these studies are proposed to train on homogeneous data in statistically or systematically heterogeneous settings and can not be directly applied to Hetero-FTL problems.
There is a lack of studies leveraging KD to tackle the data space heterogeneity in VFL or Hetero-FTL.
Specialized aggregation procedures for Hetero-FTL still need to be extensively explored.</p>

<p id="S9.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In heterogeneous FL, either instances or features are required to be aligned among parties for knowledge transfer in collaborative training.
However, the training and test data may not be aligned during federated model training and inference. Moreover, as the number of participants increases in VFL and instance-sharing Hetero-FTL, the number of aligned instances drops drastically.
Some existing approaches to handling missing features can be adapted into heterogeneous FL.
For example, in vertical decision tree models, the un-aligned missing features can be handled as missing values in centralized decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
In multi-active party settings, each party train a local base learner, and the global model is the ensemble of all base learners.
If an instance can not be aligned among all parties, the models of the un-aligned parties can be omitted during training or inference.
However, few tailored approaches in heterogeneous FL handle the adaptability to instance or feature un-alignment.
Therefore, it is desirable to develop FL architectures that can train and predict partially aligned data with a part of parties.</p>

<p id="S9.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Communication and computation efficiency are significant problems that affect the performance of FL.
In heterogeneous FL, participants need to transfer intermediate results, local model parameters, or local model predictions to each other or a server.
System redundancy, privacy mechanism, and performance requirements can affect communication and computation efficiency in terms of data volume or time delay.
Some works eliminate the communication redundancy by proposing tailored encryption and secure computation protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> or asynchronous model aggregation scheme. In contrast, some other work focuses on the efficiency-performance-privacy trade-off triangle and proposes to provide weaker privacy protection and lower model performance for lower communication costs. For example, the parties may conduct more local iterations before communication-costly model aggregation.
Although there have been several works studying asynchronous VFL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, it is still an open problem to design asynchronous algorithms for solving real-world VFL tasks with only one or partial parties holding labels.</p>

We denote that existing sparse data-friendly algorithms in plain-text centralized learning can not be directly applied to privacy-preserving FL settings. For example, in heterogeneous FL, the private data may be protected by HE or secret-shared, making it infeasible to transfer the index of the non-zero value in training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>.

The deep learning-based majority in Hetero-FTL prefer to take model performance and communication efficiency as the primary concern and sacrifice data privacy by training the Hetero-FTL model in plain-text without obfuscation such as DP.
Some researchers map heterogeneous feature space into a common latent feature space via different constrain metrics such as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib173" title="" class="ltx_ref">173</a>]</cite>, and Earth mover’s distance (EMD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite>.
However, these metrics can only be calculated with access to raw data.
The problem of heterogeneous federated deep model training in a privacy-preserving manner remains open.</p>

<div id="S9.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL provides better privacy protection compared to traditional centralized training as it eliminates raw data transmission among parties. However, it is demonstrated that the model integrity can be attacked by malicious adversaries, who deviate from the training scheme and intentionally break the model integrity.
Compared to the studies on attacks on homogeneous FL, there are only a few studies on the robustness against malicious attacks, including poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks in VFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>, <a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite>.
Yuan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib190" title="" class="ltx_ref">190</a>]</cite> studied Byzantine-resilient vertical federated logistic regression via dual sub-gradient method.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on robustness against attacks in Hetero-FTL.
Therefore, it is essential to study attack methods to heterogeneous FL and develop defensive strategies to counteract these attacks to ensure the robustness of the heterogeneous FL systems.
Especially with more complex protocols and architectures developed for Hetero-FTL, more work is needed to study related forms of attacks and defenses to enable robust Hetero-FTL approaches to emerge.</p>

<div id="S9.SS2.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S9.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, the explainability of FL models is starting to gain traction as practical FL applications face pressure from government agencies and the general public for the underlying reason to get the prediction, especially for the high-risk application scenarios.
However, explainable heterogeneous FL has not been explored in the literature.
The explainability of FL models may also be associated with potential privacy risks from inadvertent information leakage, as some gradient-based explanation methods might cause privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib191" title="" class="ltx_ref">191</a>]</cite>.
To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of study exploring the explainability in heterogeneous FL.
It is an important future research direction to balance the trade-off between explainability, performance, and privacy in heterogeneous FL.</p>

<p id="S10.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this survey, we provide an overview of privacy-preserving heterogeneous federated learning.
We propose a unique taxonomy of heterogeneous federated learning for data space, statistical, and system heterogeneity.
We categorized each type of heterogeneity according to the problem setting and learning approaches and highlighted key ideas and methodologies for those heterogeneous federated learning approaches.
We find that the data space heterogeneous federated learning, especially the Hetero-FTL is still under-explored and is a promising research direction that attracts increasing research interests.
Then, we discuss the applications of privacy-preserving heterogeneous federated learning in different areas.
Finally, we discuss several challenges and promising future research opportunities.
We believe that the discussions in this survey based on our proposed heterogeneous federated learning will serve as a valuable roadmap for aspiring researchers and practitioners to enter the field of heterogeneous federated learning and contribute to its long-term development.</p>

From a certain point of view, both oblivious transfer protocols and threshold homomorphic encryption schemes use the idea of secret sharing. This might be why secret sharing is widely regarded as the core of MPC. In the rest of this section, we will introduce secret sharing and oblivious transfer.</p>

The Paillier cryptosystem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib215" title="" class="ltx_ref">215</a>]</cite> is a PHE scheme that allows additive operations over ciphertext. It has been widely applied to various PPML researches.
Gentry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib216" title="" class="ltx_ref">216</a>]</cite> proposed the first FHE scheme that supports both additive and multiplicative operations for unlimited number of times.
Recently, Cheon, Kim, Kim and Song (CKKS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed an approximate FHE scheme that supports a special kind of fixed-point arithmetic.
The CKKS scheme is the most efficient approach for evaluating polynomial approximations, and is the preferred approach for implementing PPML applications.</p>

<p id="A1.SS0.SSS3.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Differential privacy only aims to protect membership-privacy that one adversary can not determine if a certain instance is inside the dataset. However, the statistics of the dataset can still be revealed, which could be sensitive in some cases, such as financial data, medical data and other commercial and health applications.
Moreover, DP faces a trade-off between utility and privacy as it introduces noises to results.
It is shown that current DP mechanisms in ML rarely provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs: settings that provide little accuracy loss can hardly provide strong privacy protection, while the settings that provide strong privacy result in large accuracy loss.

Fan and Hamed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib223" title="" class="ltx_ref">223</a>]</cite> explored the use of TrustZone in edge devices to conduct efficient and private FL. The local model training process is conducted in the TEE of client devices to prevent clients from inferring information from gradients present in the global model or conducting causative attacks. The server encrypts the model after model aggregation and sends it to the clients. The model is decrypted inside the TEE for training, in which the client can not learn information about the model. After local training, the trusted application encrypts the model before sending it outside the TrustZone and back to the server. Therefore, all clients collaboratively train the model without knowing its plaintext.
Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib224" title="" class="ltx_ref">224</a>]</cite> studied the privacy-preserving FL with TEE via SGX. Local model training and severe model aggregation are conducted in secure enclaves for privacy preservation and training process integrity.
Apart from protecting the model against clients by conducting FL in TEEs of edge devices and encrypting models, clients can also encrypt and send private data to TEE in a server. The server then decrypts data inside TEE and trains a global model over data contributed by all the clients.</p>

The feature activations of the teacher and the student are directly matched to distillation loss.
Therefore, the teacher and the student models first project the features to a common latent space.
Then, a distillation loss is employed to minimize the distance of the two feature representations from the teacher and the student of the same instance in the latent space.
