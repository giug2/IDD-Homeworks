<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">A novel framework of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-enhanced indoor wireless networks is proposed, where an RIS mounted on the robot is invoked to enable mobility of the RIS and enhance the service quality for mobile users. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques are adopted to further increase the spectrum efficiency since RISs are capable to provide NOMA with artificial controlled channel conditions, which can be seen as a beneficial operation condition to obtain NOMA gains. To optimize the sum rate of all users, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is invoked to optimize the deployment and phase shifts of the mobile RIS as well as the power allocation policy. In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of agent training for the DDPG agents, a federated learning (FL) concept is adopted to enable multiple agents to simultaneously explore similar environments and exchange experiences. We also proved that with the same random exploring policy, the FL armed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents can theoretically obtain a reward gain compare to the independent agents.
Our simulation results indicate that the mobile RIS scheme can significantly outperform the fixed RIS paradigm, which provides about three times data rate gain compare to the fixed RIS paradigm. Moreover, the NOMA scheme is capable to achieve a gain of 42% in contrast with the OMA scheme in terms of sum rate. Finally, the multi-cell simulation proved that the FL enhanced DDPG algorithm has a superior convergence rate and optimization performance than the independent training framework.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, also known as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, have been anticipated as a neonatal component of future communication systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. By employing a number of arranged reflecting elements, the signal can be reflected by RISs to provide additional channels for wireless links <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Therefore, once the phases of reflection elements are coordinated in a well-organized manner, an effect of passive beamforming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> can be achieved and the reflected signal can be concentrated on users to provide considerable channel gains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. One of the main factors that RISs can provide noticeable gain is that they can provide further possible line-of-sight (LoS) paths for users who do not originally have an LoS path <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, in most existing research contributions, RISs are fixed on a wall or other bearing, and therefore the fixed deployment causes RISs may not be able to obtain LoS paths and optimal channel enhancement, especially in the environment with obstructions.
In an effort to complement this defect, in this paper, we propose a mobile RIS model that RISs are mounted on intelligent robots to achieve its flexible deployment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another compelling concern in the communication field is the user capacity since the number of users brought by the Internet of Things (IoT) is upstaging continuously <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. As a consequence, to further improve the capacity and spectrum efficiency of wireless networks, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques have become a highly sought-after candidate technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Moreover, NOMA techniques have been proved to be capable of achieving several advantages specifically in the RIS-assisted communication network. As pointed out by the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, affinities between RISs and the NOMA scheme include that RISs can provide additional signal diversity, desired channel condition, and undemanding multi-antenna constrain for NOMA systems. The main interplay is that in a conventional NOMA enhanced wireless network, the decoding order of successive interference cancelation (SIC) determined by the natural channel state information (CSI) of users, which is not likely to be fully consistent with the users’ data rate demand. However, RISs can artificially modify the CSI for each user and thereby provide desired propagation condition for superposed signals. Therefore, NOMA techniques are invoked in our mobile RIS model to obtain further capacity and data rate gains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To maximize the profit of empowering mobility to RISs, how to plan proper dynamic deployments for mobile RISs are a problem worth exploring. Since users are considered as moving as well, the optimization problem is highly dynamic, and the joint optimization problem of movements and phase shifts of RISs is an emerging problem worth exploring. In addition, since obstacles that hinder the movement of RISs and shields LoS paths are likely to have irregular and non-analytic shapes, this also raises challenges for conventional optimization approaches.
In contrast to convex optimization, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is considered to be a more competent methodology for dynamic optimization problems since DRL is able to recognize the current state of the environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, since multiple mobile RISs can be deployed in different cells, federated learning (FL) is employed to strengthen their training efficiency and effectiveness for the proposed multi-cell multi-agent scenario <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. FL arouses the interest of researchers as a distributed learning framework since it can effectively utilize computational resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> with a protection of user privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Especially for the DRL algorithm, FL can improve training efficiency and learning effect, since agents can explore the environments simultaneously and their knowledge can be transferred to each other through a global neural networks model.
Therefore, we propose a DRL algorithm with a framework of FL, namely the FL enhanced deep deterministic policy gradient (FL-DDPG) algorithm to jointly optimize the passive beamforming, dynamic deployment of RISs, and the power allocation for NOMA users.</p>

The author of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> investigated the physical layer security of a RIS enhanced NOMA system. A NOMA based model of RIS-UAV communication was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, where the authors deployed RISs on the outer surface of the skyscraper to assist the wireless link of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs’ trajectories, passive beamforming of the RISs and power allocation are treated as optimization variables to minimize the energy cost of the UAVs. A partitioned RIS was employed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to enhance the spectrum efficiency by improving the ergodic rate of all users, and the the physical resources distribution was optimized by three efficient search algorithms.

Since users are constantly roaming, in order to maximize the channel gain, the robot carried RISs have to be deployed opportunely according to the real-time user distribution. The robot operates on the floor and the RIS is set at a fixed height on the robot, as a result the altitude of RIS is considered as a constant. In order to ensure safe operations, the robot cannot cross or collide with any obstacles, it also has to be guaranteed that the RIS will not collide with people.</p>

Finally, taking into account the fairness of users, constraint (<a href="#S3.E25.5" title="In 25 ‣ III-E Problem Formulation ‣ III System Model ‣ Mobile Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for NOMA Networks: Federated Learning Approaches" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">25e</span></a>) represents the data rate of each user at any time <math id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS5.p1.7.m1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS5.p1.7.m1.1.1">𝑡</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS5.p1.7.m1.1c">t</annotation></semantics></math> is guaranteed to meet the minimum rate of QoS requirement. As mentioned above, the predicament of the optimization is that the formulated problem is dynamic, non-convex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and the obstructive environment is non-functional. It is worth mentioning that the phase shift optimization in the NOMA scenario not only provides channel enhancement for users, but the channel modification has to be NOMA-friendly as well to take care of user fairness. Therefore, a DRL algorithm is invoked to solve the formulated problem.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is competent to be invoked for optimizing the proposed communication model. As aforementioned, the proposed indoor network composed of APs has cellular characteristics to extend, and independent agents served in each cell have great common functions and attributes. For example, the pursuit of service quality, the equipment of RISs and the propagation characteristics of signals in each cell are equal, which constitutes the cornerstone of adopting the FL framework.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The FL framework has a number of common advantages for all ML algorithms, for example, it can save more hardware resources, improve training speed, and with the protection of user privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Moreover, in addition to these frequently mentioned advantages, DRL algorithms are specifically suitable to be applied in the FL framework. The learning process of RL comes from continuously interacting with the environment and exploring different states and actions. However, the exploration of the environment is not likely to exhaust all states though the action policy contains random actions or noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, which leads to the global optimum may being buried in the quagmire. In particular, the proposed communication scenarios and indoor layouts have high complexity, impelling the efficient and sufficient exploration to be a problem. Therefore, the training effect of DRL is determined by whether the agent has sufficient exploration and experience, fortunately, the participation of FL is helpful to reveal more different states since multi-agents are investigating the environment, which allows the environment to be explored more sufficiently.</p>

transitions have been traversed by agents.
Furthermore, the global model can also greatly enriches the experience diversity since each agent has different initialization and pseudorandom. In summary, by establishing a global model and exchanging neural network parameters, agents located on different floors or cells can learn from each other’s experiences. The introduction of FL can improve the training efficiency and effect of DRL algorithms and the gain is also revealed by the simulation results in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Numerical Results and Analysis ‣ Mobile Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for NOMA Networks: Federated Learning Approaches" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.9" class="ltx_p">We propose an FL-DDPG algorithm to jointly optimize deployments, phase shifts of mobile RIS and the corresponding power allocation policy for users in each cell. Additionally, we implement several improvements on the original DDPG algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, such as decaying Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) noise and adaptive neural network structure to adapt the algorithm into the proposed communication scenarios. We assume that each local agent is deployed within the AP and it can control the actions of the RIS and the carrier robot via the control channel. Due to the actor-critic structure, four neural networks are used in the DDPG agent, namely the actor network <math id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Q" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Q</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑄</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">Q</annotation></semantics></math>, the critic network <math id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">μ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝜇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">\mu</annotation></semantics></math>, the actor target network <math id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Q^{\prime}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><msup id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">Q</mi><mo id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">′</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑄</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">′</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.3.m3.1c">Q^{\prime}</annotation></semantics></math> and the critic target network <math id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu^{\prime}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1a"><msup id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">μ</mi><mo id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">′</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2">𝜇</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3">′</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1c">\mu^{\prime}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The convergence of the basic Q-learning has been proved in a series of literatures, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. However, due to the introduction of neural networks, the convergence of the DDPG algorithm is no longer guaranteed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. In fact, DRL algorithms may fail to converge under the interference of improper parameters setting. Nevertheless, the proposed FL-DDPG algorithm is capable to converge when a few constraints are met. If the learning rate, target network update rate and action noise are properly set, FL-DDPG can converge stably, which can be proved by simulation results displayed in Section <a href="#S6" title="VI Numerical Results and Analysis ‣ Mobile Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for NOMA Networks: Federated Learning Approaches" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Section VI aims to exhibit numerical results of the FL-DDPG optimized mobile RIS system. In the simulation, we assume that each cell serves four users and these users are partitioned into two clusters. Each user makes a random movement on the horizontal plane at every time slot, the moving distance conforms to the Rayleigh distribution and the direction following the uniform distribution.
The building structure of each cell is assumed to be the same, and the global model update frequency for the FL is 20 episodes. As for the agent, Adam optimizers are employed for the neural network training and the proper learning rate range is <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="5\times 10^{-4}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">5</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><msup id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mo id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3a" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">5</cn><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">10</cn><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><minus id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">4</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">5\times 10^{-4}</annotation></semantics></math> to <math id="S6.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10^{-5}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.2.m2.1a"><msup id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mo id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3a" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">5</mn></mrow></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">10</cn><apply id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><minus id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">5</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1c">10^{-5}</annotation></semantics></math> according to our simulation.

In this figure, the orange curve records the trajectory of the mobile RIS and the blue stars represent the position where the robot stops at each discrete time slot, which is also the RIS position that is input into the neural network as a part of the state information. The mobile RIS is initially placed in the middle area of the office, and it moves to a corner gradually so that provides LoS cover for the large area blocked by the sofa. The gray and white blocks correspond to the furniture and walls of different heights.

It can be observed that the average throughput of the system increases steadily over the training episodes and gradually flattens out in the late stage of training, which proves that the algorithm has stable convergence within a proper learning rate range. The throughput of well trained agents indicates that an inappropriately large learning rate can result in a debuff in optimization performance. For example, when the learning rate is 0.001, the throughput suffers a decrease of approximately 7% compared to the other two learning rates. Moreover, we can observe a significant NOMA gain, which is around 42% compared to the OMA scheme under the same conditions.</p>

The data rate gain of the 4 antennas case is approximately 11.6% on average, compared to the case of double antennas. The NOMA gain is higher with the growth of the transmission power, the reason is when the transmission power is low, the weaker users are not likely to meet the QoS requirements and need to be allocated more power to ensure the fairness.

First of all, the dynamic decoding order achieves a gain of 10.2% compared to the pre-settled static decoding order. By observing the curve, it can be found that in this case the flexibly deployed RIS obtains an additional 15.1% data rate gain compared to the fixed RIS scheme, where the RIS is settled at the start position in Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI Numerical Results and Analysis ‣ Mobile Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for NOMA Networks: Federated Learning Approaches" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. It is worth noting that the performance improvement provided by the mobile RIS even exceeds the performance difference between the fixed RIS model and no RIS engaged network, which indicates the superiority of the mobile RIS framework is substantial and puissant. In addition, in contrast to the fixed RIS model, the mobile RIS has compelling compatibility for various user distributions. In order to investigate the effect of the phase shift optimization, we employ a RIS with random phase shifts as another benchmark. It is undeniable that the RIS with random phase shifts also leads to a diminutive gain compared to the no RIS mode, but it is far inferior than the DRL optimized case. Meanwhile, the curve behaves unevenness even in the final episodes since the phase is not controlled by the agent.</p>

DF is 0 means that the cells have the same channel characteristics. Obviously, FL achieved the optative performance in this case, since agents are in the same environments so that the model update has the highest efficiency. It is worth noting that even though the rooms have similar architectural structures, they have different fading characteristics due to the difference in decoration and surface materials. Therefore, we investigate the cases that cells with propagation differences, and DF = 1 suggests that the propagation characteristics of each cell are completely independent. It can be observed that even in the case of DF=1, FL-enhanced DRL still has stable convergence, and is capable to achieve a matched average sum rate to the single-cell case.</p>

Since the DRL approaches train agents by replaying the obtained experiences, more diverse and richer experience of transitions obtained by FL makes the agents’ decision-making wiser.

However, in practice, under the condition that the training time is limited, FL has a significant training advantage compared to the mode without FL.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has proposed a NOMA enhanced wireless network model with the aid of mobile RISs that can provide NOMA craved channel conditions and improve channel quality for users. In order to optimize deployments and phase shifts of RISs and the corresponding power allocation for users, an FL enhanced DDPG algorithm has been proposed, which has preponderant performance under the same training extend compared to the independent DLR scheme since the engagement of FL lead to more sufficient exploration and experience exchange for agents. Simulation results proved that 1) Compared to the scenario without RIS, mobile RISs are capable to provide around 30.1% data rate gain that significantly exceeds the gain of the fixed RISs paradigm, which is 12.4%; 2) The NOMA scheme, where the proposed dynamic decoding identification method is applied, outperforms the OMA scheme by obtaining approximately 42% gain in terms of the sum rate.; 3) The FL enhanced DDPG algorithm has stable convergence while the parameters are within an appropriate range and the participation of the federated learning can considerably reduce the training time of the DDPG agents or improve the training effect under a limited equal training process.</p>
