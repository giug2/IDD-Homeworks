<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Non-IID dataset and heterogeneous environment of the local clients are regarded as a major issue in Federated Learning (FL), causing a downturn in the convergence without achieving satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Label-wise clustering algorithm that guarantees the trainability among geographically dispersed heterogeneous local clients, by selecting only the local models trained with a dataset that approximates into uniformly distributed class labels, which is likely to obtain faster minimization of the loss and increment the accuracy among the FL network. Through conducting experiments on the suggested six common non-IID scenarios, we empirically show that the vanilla FL aggregation model is incapable of gaining robust convergence generating biased pre-trained local models and drifting the local weights to mislead the trainability in the worst case. Moreover, we quantitatively estimate the expected performance of the local models before training, which offers a global server to select the optimal clients, saving additional computational costs. Ultimately, in order to gain resolution of the non-convergence in such non-IID situations, we design clustering algorithms based on local input class labels, accommodating the diversity and assorting clients that could lead the overall system to attain the swift convergence as global training continues. Our paper shows that proposed Label-wise clustering demonstrates prompt and robust convergence compared to other FL algorithms when local training datasets are non-IID or coexist with IID through multiple experiments.</p>

<p id="p1.2" class="ltx_p">As contemporary systems are being operated in dynamic situations which are alternating into decentralized and distributed environments from conventional centralized frameworks, Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining attention for it is an optimal architecture when aggregating the information of geographically distributed dataset. However, the convergence of FL suffers to skewed and biased non-IID local dataset which are common in real-world practice. Based on the basic but powerful intuition of selecting the optimal clients that approximates to the uniform distribution of local class labels, our label-wise clustering algorithm provides robust convergence when learning among distributed local models in FL. Our paper suggests the six types of common non-IID scenarios in FL and limitation analysis when those cases are trained in vanilla FL. We also propose the evaluation methodology that quantitatively assess the local models through statistical properties without training them, which offers the significant preservation of resources.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Number of IT devices and their computational ability have grown significantly, continuously generating a vast volume of diverse dataset. This fostered the AI technology to become increasingly prospective, which has created and established the values through a variety of utilizations in miscellaneous domains. On account of the enhanced computation performance of the ubiquitous local machines, implementing AI algorithms such as deep learning or machine learning in such devices are now prevalent in order to discover semantics and to create values. In this context, Federated Learning (FL) [1-3] architecture have been suggested, attracting the countless attention in both IT industry and academia, as an apposite framework to be utilized in practical applications, which accommodates the heterogeneity of distributed local dataset. However, acquiring IID (Independently and Identically Distributed) data in a designated local machine is not guaranteed in a real-world distributed environment, as most of the existing systems tend to be biased and skewed due to intrinsic propensity and external factors that influence the circumstances. Thus, measures in order to upgrade the FL performance were introduced to successfully mitigate the unstable impact of aggregating non-IID data through approaches such as utilizing learning paradigms [4-9], clustering [10-14], knowledge distillation [15-18], stochastic approach [11], [19-20], Bayesian theorem [21-24], etc. Initially, FL architecture was specifically designed in order to accommodate the effective training among the distributed conditions without sending the local data itself for security purposes [1], [2], [25], thus many researches were conducted on FL to achieve higher privacy such as detecting adversaries [12], [26]. Moreover, FL has been applied in the network domain as well, in order to construct efficient communication system architecture among heterogeneous local models to reduce the overhead [27], [28]. Likewise, FL was suggested as a viable methodology that effectively encompasses the geographically dispersed local models that were trained independently, which lead the diverse domains to implement the FL architecture such as in healthcare [17], [29-33], IoT [34-37] or Security [38-44].</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, the vanilla FL suffers from the biased and skewed non-IID local dataset, drifting the convergence with low trainability. This seem natural as basic FL model was originally constructed to aggregate the local models that were fully trained with IID dataset. In this research, we suggest a novel label-wise clustering algorithm to gain robust convergence in non-IID input data among the FL network. Before we propound our algorithm, we define the six non-IID training scenarios in perspective of three major entities; individual locals, sum of locals in each global communication round, and every local in sum of all global rounds. We experimentally show that the conventional and well-known FL model (FedAvg) [1] does not approach convergence among such non-IID scenarios [3], [45-48], as FedAvg was suitably designed for IID input dataset. Based on this problem, we introduce the label-wise clustering algorithm in order to gain robust convergence in biased and skewed non-IID input dataset. In FedAvg, after training the local models with their private dataset, the global server randomly collects the parameters of partially selected local models. Choosing random clients is proven to be effective when most of the random sets are independent and identically distributed, whereas most real-world cases do not follow this assumption, having skewed and biased distribution of labels. Therefore, our basic idea is to import the local models with the order of highest variance of the corresponding label set and those approximate the uniform distribution, which will maximize the label coverage. This is a heuristic and powerful approach that can maximize the efficiency of current local data which could guide the global model in FL to optimal convergence. According to this basis, we suggest an evaluation metric that quantitatively assesses the local models before training. Thus, we train the optimal clients only which offers the profound reduction of computational resources, followed by aggregating the parameters of the selected models. we validate our approach through topological analysis and design label-wise clustering algorithm that could maintain the convergence in heterogeneous non-IID and when co-existing with IID local dataset. Through experiments, our algorithm was shown to have an average of 24% higher accuracy than existing FedAvg and FedSGD [1] in non-IID dataset in given identical global epochs, which ultimately led to faster convergence.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning [1-3] is a novel architecture that was recently suggested by Brendon <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [1], which effectively integrates the diversity of locally distributed dataset, as storage capacity and computation ability has substantially been enhanced for local devices in the modern IT era. Nonetheless, when importing local models that were persistently trained with biased and skewed local data, it leads to contamination of global performance and occasionally evanescing the pre-trained weights (<span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span> client drift [19], [49]) which requires constructive measures to guide the weights to reach the optimal convergence.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Diverse past studies were conducted to decrease, filtrate or prognose the potential effect of non-IID input data. Briggs <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [10] defined the four primary non-IID status, suggesting the appropriate combination of distance and linkage that shows the best performance when implementing the hierarchical clustering among the local clients in Federated Learning through multiple experiments. Chen <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [50] proposed three clustering algorithms in FL and analyzed that clustering in FL acquires faster loss convergence than FedAvg in non-convex optimization, showing that clustering approach in FL comes effective. Ouyang <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [51] implemented dropout mechanism which drops the straggler models that were not well-trained, and selected local models based on the weight correlations. Authors clustered the data after reducing its dimension using PCA, and measured the similarity of local models. Kim <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [52] designed dynamic clustering through GAN, which continuously updates the cluster through latent vectors generated from GAN. Ghosh <span id="S2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [13] devised an iterative clustering in FL (IFCA), which has shown to be effective in strongly convex functions. Li <span id="S2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [53] suggested the upgraded algorithm based on the IFCA, which lets the clusters to be overlapped which could congregate the clients in a more successful way, thus achieving better convergence. Xie <span id="S2.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [11] presented a new approach called multi-center FL clustering, by constructing multiple global models and assigning them to the nearest local models. Many studies [17], [54], [55] have implemented auxiliary public dataset to minimize the biased distribution of class labels of existing clients, which accommodates the improvement of training performance in FL. Li <span id="S2.p2.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [16] curated an additional public dataset that could assist the training among the local models and adopted transfer learning with knowledge distillation in the FL network. Yang <span id="S2.p2.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. [56] utilized updated model weights to estimate the class distribution utilizing supplementary dataset. Using public dataset as auxiliary method comes practical when existing local dataset are considerably biased, as it supplements the diversity of labels. However, as it requires additional storage capacity which comes as an disadvantage to local models that has low computational power. Also, when large number of class label types are to be classified, volume of benchmark dataset may be large even though local training dataset for each class are minute. Our proposed work is analogous to this approach, based on the fact that quality of training class labels determines the quality of FL. Distance-based clustering such as K-means or Hierarchical clustering in FL form clusters with pairwise distances. Considering that trained weights of deep learning models are permutationally invariant, clustering through pairwise metrics is algorithmically ineffective. However, past studies [10-14], [26], [29], [50-52], [53], [57] have empirically shown that it turned out to be partially successful in converging the global loss function in given feature space, but little logical explanations are specified about the reason behind this phenomenon. Furthermore, most of the past works have clustered the pre-trained weights of the selected local models, whereas the local features may overlap, which is abstruse for the clustering algorithm to form productive clusters. Even for distinct dataset such as MNIST [58], when clustering the set of MNIST itself, the results are partially correct [59] since several data shares similar features with disparate labels, having a lookalike shape in 2-dimensional figures such as number 1 and 7. These shortcomings imply that distance-based local weight clustering is an approach that is intractable to explain, which gives us an inspiration to design an algorithm that clusters through the given local labels.
Although past several studies has emphasized that biased labels are major defect that perturbs the functionality under FL settings, they suggested alternatives [17], [54-56], [60], [61] such as implementing public dataset. To the best of our knowledge, there were no published articles that selects local models through evaluating their corresponding labels with statistical metrics without using auxiliary dataset on FL framework.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p5.21" class="ltx_p">FL is mainly used in domains of supervised learning and should be able to achieve its objective such as classification or regression with high performance using the extracted real-time local training dataset from the designated environment. However, most real-world dataset is skewed, biased and does not guarantee a certain statistical distribution [62], which will degrade the function of the model. In this section, we define six prevalent scenarios that train the non-IID data and show that its convergence is not assured by corresponding experiments. We have focused the scenarios on three perspectives in FL: <span id="S3.SS1.p5.21.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">individual local clients in a single global epoch</span>, <span id="S3.SS1.p5.21.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all local clients in a single global epoch</span>, and <span id="S3.SS1.p5.21.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all local clients in every global epoch</span>.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.26" class="ltx_p">In order to validate that the FedAvg cannot obtain the optimal convergence in non-IID setting, we empirically test the six cases explained in prior subsection, with randomly selected 30 local clients among 100 client populations to conduct image classifications using MNIST dataset, each client trained with 4 epochs, 32 batch size and 6 layers (Conv2D-Pooling-Conv2D-Flatten-Dense-Dense) using Adam optimizer and categorical cross entropy loss function. Since MNIST is already a well-preprocessed dataset which CNN locates its features smoothly, and local devices in FL may contain low computational processors compared to servers such as laptop, mobile phone or tablet, thus high local epoch is unnecessary. <math id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n(D_{\exists i})=290" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to minimize the heterogeneity and biased distribution of the labels in a given environment, we implement the label-wise clustering to overcome the frozen or untrainable weights. As we have shown in section III.1, when the variance of the set of unique labels among all the models in synchronous global epoch is high, it triggers the highest training performance, which implies that optimal convergence in FL can be gained through training various labels of dataset. Since FL is implemented in supervised learning [2], [3], we assume that the input dataset is preprocessed and labeled in advance, thus we suggest the clustering method to guarantee the acquisition of fairly distributed labels in non-IID local training data. As we have shown that the input local dataset is skewed toward certain label(s), this would lag the weights to be inactive. In such a scenario, our approach for this problem is to cluster the locally-trained models in advance and select only the locals which could guarantee the convergence.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Each identically layer-structured local model among FL network that are trained through heterogenous local training dataset can be assessed before it trains its model through evaluating their corresponding dataset. Recall that FL is supervised learning, in which its class labels are predefined, giving us the possibility of collecting the information of local models as training AI models require a comprehensive resource consuming process. Since label-wise clustering aims to cluster the local models to sort the clients that encompass the dataset with various distributions before training them.

Every client carries an identically structured with the equivalent hyperparameter values of CNN model to classify the given image data, with the layer structure of Conv2D – MaxPooling – Con2D – MaxPooling – Flatten – Dense – Dense. Specified structure of the model is set with a comparatively small number of layers to indicate the low computation ability of local clients such as mobile devices to operate the lightweight AI models. In addition, the global epoch was set to 30, local epoch to 4 with a batch size of 32 in FedAvg and Label-wise Cluster FL.
The first experiment is to measure and compare the accuracy outcome of three FL algorithms: FedAvg, FedSGD and Label-Clustering FL with a local dataset that has biased distribution. For the dataset, we used Fashion MNIST (FMNIST) [63] and Cifar-10 [64].

The black line displays the range of standard deviation of accuracy within 30 trials. Following experiment was conducted with identical settings in Fig. 8 and 9, except that the global epoch was set to 20. The result shows that when the proportions of IID increases, the accuracy tends to increase linearly in FedAvg. However, our Label-wise Clustering remains stable, having around 93.8% accuracy in every proportion in FMNIST and 37.6% in CIFAR-10. Based on this outcome, we can refer that performance of FedAvg is directly affected by the proportion of non-IID dataset.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose the novel algorithm which discretionally selects and aggregates only the beneficial local models among the FL networks. As the well-known expression garbage in, garbage out illustrates the importance of data quality, the fundamental principle when training an AI model is to fully prepare the cleansed training dataset, which is why most of the data scientists invest their considerable amount of effort on data preprocessing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The aim of our algorithm lies within the similar context. We seek breakthroughs of non-convergence in FL with a basic and powerful approach: selecting the local clients that contain various and approximates into uniform distribution of different labels. Due to the diverse environment of each local model, heterogeneity occurs from the non-IID local training dataset, which leads the clients’ loss function to go astray as global epoch continues. Furthermore, this triggers the client drift among FL networks, with unstable convergence and substantially degrading the overall performance, as we have defined the six heterogeneous non-IID scenarios and their training experiment results in section III-1. In such cases, our Label-wise clustering algorithm guarantees the loss convergence by agglomerating the locals that were trained with diverse and uniformly distributed labels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For future works, our interest aims to design the statistical functions of the given non-IID in FL to generalize the models for optimized alternatives, as we have demonstrated the train feasibility through experiments in section III-1. In this regard, designing the function models contains significant meaning since it could provide vigorous implementation in any FL networks consisting of heterogeneous local clients trained with certain distribution of non-IID dataset. Furthermore, our goal is to discover the explainability of trainability when combining the local models, such as in CNN some models could be trained to classify a cat with its ears, whereas others may emphasize on its eye or other parts. Thus, knowing the impact of aggregating unique models and how to construct the optimal combination is another important agenda to interpret the essence of collaboration in FL. Therefore, our ultimate research value rests on comprehending the overall FL framework to gain the predictability in probable cases and suggest the optimal resolutions.</p>
