<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Learning from limited data has been extensively studied in machine learning, considering that deep neural networks achieve optimal performance when trained using a large amount of samples. Although various strategies have been proposed for centralized training, the topic of federated learning with small datasets remains largely unexplored. Moreover, in realistic scenarios, such as settings where medical institutions are involved, the number of participating clients is also constrained. In this work, we propose a novel federated learning framework, named <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">RepTreeFL</em>. At the core of the solution is the concept of a replica, where we replicate each participating client by copying its model architecture and perturbing its local data distribution. Our approach enables learning from limited data and a small number of clients by aggregating a larger number of models with diverse data distributions. Furthermore, we leverage the hierarchical structure of the clients network (both original and virtual), alongside the model diversity across replicas, and introduce a diversity-based tree aggregation, where replicas are combined in a tree-like manner and the aggregation weights are dynamically updated based on the model discrepancy. We evaluated our method on two tasks and two types of data, graph generation and image classification (binary and multi-class), with both homogeneous and heterogeneous model architectures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and outperformance of <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">RepTreeFL</em> in settings where both data and clients are limited.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Limited data has been an active area of research in machine learning, given that the performance of deep neural networks is highly dependent on the size of the dataset they are trained on. Different methods have been proposed to address this challenge, such as transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Torrey and Shavlik, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>, data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, and more recently, generating synthetic samples using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Goodfellow et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. However, applying these techniques where data resides on different devices is not straightforward.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is an approach that can be applied in the setting where data is spread across multiple machines, as it aggregates a set of models with different datasets without compromising the data privacy. While various challenges in federated learning have been analysed, such as differences in data distributions across clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Hanzely and Richtárik, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Deng et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Sattler et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Ghosh et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Arivazhagan et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> or model heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Horvath et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Diao et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Caldas et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Alam et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Shamsian et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Litany et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Li and Wang, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; He et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, the limited data issue has not been addressed often. Furthermore, federating a small number of models, which is the case in specific real-world scenarios, is largely unexplored. Therefore, the key research question becomes: <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">How can we learn efficient models in federated learning in a setting where both data and the participating clients are limited?</em></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a new federated learning method which enables the learning from limited data with only a small number of participating clients, named <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">RepTreeFL</em>. In this setting, each client is replicated for a number of times and the original data distribution is modified at each replica, which acts as a virtual copy of the client. The underlying idea is that a greater number of clients with diverse data distributions could enhance the ability of the global model to generalize. However, in real-world scenarios where medical data and healthcare institutions are involved, the number of participating hospitals (clients) is often limited and their local datasets have small sizes. Beyond replicating only the original clients, replicas creation can be done recursively, such that a replica of a replica is created, in order to obtain an even larger amount of diverse models. By leveraging the tree structure of the original and virtual clients and the model diversity across replicas, we introduce a diversity-based tree aggregation, where replicas are aggregated in a tree-like manner and the aggregation weights are dynamically computed based on the discrepancy between models. We evaluate the solution in two different settings: graph generation with heterogeneous models (where architectures vary in dimension) and image classification (binary and multi-class) with homogeneous models. The replica-based federation was published originally in our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ghilea and Rekik, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Extensive research has been conducted in machine learning to address the challenge of learning from limited data, as collecting large, high-quality datasets is impractical in general. One technique that was proposed to address this issue is transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Torrey and Shavlik, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Zhuang et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Kim et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. This approach aims to enhance learning for a target task by leveraging knowledge acquired from a source task. For instance, a model can be initially trained on a large dataset, then the learned weights can be used as a starting point for a new task which requires a much smaller dataset. Another solution is data augmentation, which overcomes the limitation by modifying the training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Chlap et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In the context of images, a straightforward approach to augment the data involves applying simple transformations such as rotation, flipping, or cropping. A more recent technique is data synthesis, which can also be viewed as a form of data augmentation. This method consists in generating synthetic data that has similar characteristics to the original training dataset. These new samples can be created using generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Goodfellow et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Gui et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, these approaches face various challenges when applied in the federated learning setting, as data augmentation could only be conducted on the local samples, transfer learning requires a public dataset, while GANs need a considerable amount of samples in order to generate high quality outputs.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is an approach that enables multiple clients to collaborate and train a global model without sharing their local datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In this way, models residing on different devices benefit from training from a larger amount of samples while preserving the data privacy. The classic federated learning algorithm is FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, where clients train their local models for multiple epochs and the server averages their parameters at each round. Later, a wide range of proposed methods addressed different challenges in federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the main limitations in federated learning is the difference between data distributions across clients. Li et al. proposed FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, which introduces a additional term to the local objective and penalizes parameters that are at a considerable distance from the global model. FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> adds a similar regularisation term, encouraging parameters of client models to converge to global stationary points. A large category of frameworks that address the data heterogeneity issue is personalized federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kulkarni et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Tan et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. In this setting, instead of training a single global model, each client generates a personalized model that addresses its own requirements. Model mixing is a popular approach in personalized federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hanzely and Richtárik, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. For instance, APFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Deng et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> aims to identify the optimal combination of global and local models using a client-specific parameter. Clustered federated learning was also proposed to create personalized models and consist in grouping similar clients and generating a different model for each group. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sattler et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> introduces hierarchical clustering, where the server recursively creates two clusters of clients by minimising the cosine similarity between models from the two different groups. In a distinct work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ghosh et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, where the number of clients is fixed, the clients are assigned a cluster at each round. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Arivazhagan et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> created FedPer, where the global model is split into base and personalized layers. While the base layers undergo training via federated averaging, the personalized layers are trained exclusively utilizing the local dataset. A specific type of personalization was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, where each client federates with other relevant clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Other studies focused on federating models with different architectures, where aggregation becomes more challenging. Partial training of the global model was one of the first proposed ideas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Horvath et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Diao et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> for solving this problem. An example from this category is Federated Dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Caldas et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, which involves setting a subset of the activations to zero in each layer of a client network. Next, only the remaining neurons are trained and transmitted to the server in a federation round. FedRolex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Alam et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> suggested an innovative rolling window extraction of the sub-models for aggregation. The window advances in each round and selects a different part of the global model each time, resulting in a uniform training of the server model parameters. Another set of works developed hypernetworks to generate the personalized model weights. pFedHN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shamsian et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> was initially created for solving the data heterogeneity limitation, but it was also evaluated on models with heterogeneous architectures. The solution uses such a hypernetworks to create weights for each client individually using client embeddings. Graph hypernetworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Litany et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> were later proposed, which operate on the graph representation of the client architecture. Knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hinton et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> was also applied as a solution for federating heterogeneous architectures. FedMD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li and Wang, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> firstly performs transfer learning, as each client trains its model on a public dataset and then on its private dataset, the during the federation, the knowledge is transferred form server to clients. Another study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> introduces group knowledge transfer, where knowledge is transferred bidirectionally between clients and server.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While learning from limited data has been extensively studied in machine learning, federated learning with small datasets has been underexplored. One study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li and Wang, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> considers it as a secondary challenge and applies transfer learning to address it, while another work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kamp et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposes permutations of the local models as a solution. However, while the former requires a pubic dataset, the latter may raise privacy concerns, as models are transferred across clients during federation. Moreover, we are also interested in learning with a few participating clients. We previously developed a replica-based federated learning solution for the limited data setting with a small number of participating clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ghilea and Rekik, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. However, we extend the approach presented in our earlier work by taking into account the diversity across models in the aggregation step and making the depth of the replicas variable across clients.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At the core of our solution is the concept of a replica, introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ghilea and Rekik, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>. One limitation that exists in some specific federated learning situations, such as when medical institutions are involved, is the small number of clients that can participate in the federation. The replication of the original clients generates a larger amount of clients, which overcomes this challenge. A second limitation that exists in real-world scenarios is the small amount of data. The solution for this challenge is closely related to the client replicas, as on each virtual client, a slightly different local dataset is created by perturbing the parent (anchor or replica) data distribution. The intuition is that a larger amount of clients with diverse data distributions would enhance the generalisability of the global model. The replica creation is defined by two key aspects:</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">We aim to boost the diversity across the generated replicas to enhance the model performance. To achieve this, we propose a model discrepancy metric to quantify the dissimilarity between the anchor model and each of its replicas. Similarly, the metric can be computed if the parent node is a replica itself. The model diversity is computed as follows:</p>

For instance, clients might have different compute capacities or they might focus on different tasks, such as in multi-tasking. In this case, models are heterogeneous and only a subset of the layers are common across architectures.

Given that our method is developed for limited data setting, we evaluate the framework on a subset of the train set, such that each client has a local dataset of 200 samples. As model architecture, we use ResNet10, a smaller variant of the well-known ResNet18 architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed RepTreeFL, a novel framework for the limited data setting, where a small number of clients are participating in the federation process. The solution consists in replicating each original client and perturbing its local dataset, such that the model performance is enhanced by a larger amount of diverse clients. The method combines the tree structure of the client network, as well as the diversity across created replicas, and introduces a diversity-based aggregation approach. Empirical evaluation shows the efficacy of the proposed method on two different settings: image classification with homogeneous models and graph generation with heterogeneous models. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the main hyperparameters, on the perturbation approach, as well as on datasets of variable sizes. Future work includes analysing more complex diversity metrics for aggregation, as well as evaluating the method on non-IID data and decreasing the compute and memory budgets.</p>
