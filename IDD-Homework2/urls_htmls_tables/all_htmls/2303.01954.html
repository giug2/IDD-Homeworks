<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Artificial Intelligence and digital health have the potential to transform global health. However, having access to representative data to test and validate algorithms in realistic production environments is essential. We introduce <em id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HealthSyn</em>, an open-source synthetic data generator of user behavior for testing reinforcement learning algorithms in the context of mobile health interventions. The generator utilizes Markov processes to generate diverse user actions, with individual user behavioral patterns that can change in reaction to personalized interventions (i.e., reminders, recommendations, and incentives). These actions are translated into actual logs using an ML-purposed data schema specific to the mobile health application functionality included with <em id="id4.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HealthKit</em>, and open-source SDK. The logs can be fed to pipelines to obtain user metrics. The generated data, which is based on real-world behaviors and simulation techniques, can be used to develop, test, and evaluate, both ML algorithms in research and end-to-end operational RL-based intervention delivery frameworks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Digital tools have become essential for frontline health workers (FHWs) everywhere, particularly in resource-poor settings where they are often designed to mitigate the effects of the lack of resources or infrastructure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Marsch, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Overdijkink et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. From capacity building and communication to patient management and triage assistance or medical supply delivery, there is an array of mobile health solutions to help workers provide the best care possible to their communities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Overdijkink et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Hosny &amp; Aerts, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Wahl et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Forero et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">These tools provide an excellent opportunity for personalization through adaptive technologies, using the rich information about provider and patient behavior and outcomes contained in the records generated through the use of digital applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Olaniyi et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Guitart et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>; <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>; Katsaris et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. This allows us to provide additional support by adapting the content to each FHW’s and patient’s evolving needs and by delivering timely reminders, suggestions, or personalized incentives specifically designed to work for them at precisely that time. We thus increase the chances of success by adopting an adaptive, contextualized approach to innovation that allows for rapid deployment cycles. Big tech has excelled at this iterative model, although optimizing for engagement and monetization rather than well-being.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Statistical analysis and machine learning (ML) models play a crucial role in using the information available to understand and predict individual FHW or patient behavior in order to design the best interventions for each use case <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hosny &amp; Aerts, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Wahl et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Reinforcement learning (RL), a subset of these methodologies, additionally provides the algorithmic framework for making decisions about when and which interventions to send <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yom-Tov et al., <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Forman et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Liao et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Trella et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. It allows us to fine-tune the system depending on how much weight on knowledge extraction (i.e., gathering data that will allow statistical inference with enough power) or on optimization (i.e., using all information to make the best choice for each individual even if it hinders statistical significance) we want to put.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data is becoming increasingly important due to concerns about reproducibility and establishing baselines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jordon et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Healthcare data is extraordinarily sensitive, and privacy through appropriate de-identification is a crucial step (largely yet to be overcome) before any data can be shared for analysis and ML  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yoon et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Jordon et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. Adaptive technologies involve complex feedback cycles and long-term effects, so having a way to simulate user behavior, both in the absence of interventions and in their reactions to them, becomes essential for safe development and testing before the deployment with real subjects.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HealthSyn</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(benshi.ai, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023a</a>)</cite>, an open-source library for mobile health data generation, and describe its components and methodology. It can be used for ML model development and can be coupled to algorithmic decision-making on interventions to which the user will react, thus providing an end-to-end simulation environment for RL-based interventions in mobile health. User behavioral logs from mobile health applications are tracked using <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HealthKit</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(benshi.ai, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023b</a>)</cite>, an open-source Software Developer Kit (SDK) for mobile health. It is responsible for the tracking, labeling, and organization of the logs in a data schema optimized for ML and intervention purposes. <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HealthKit</em> tracks general in-app users’ behavior (actions, sessions, etc.) and additional events organized based on the type of content (patient management, capacity building, etc.). It also delivers the interventions and tracks the user’s reaction to them (e.g. whether notifications were opened, discarded, or blocked). It distinguishes between online and offline activity, which is particularly important when working with global health applications, as they are often used without an internet connection, impacting both user behavior and the interventions that will work best for them.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HealthSyn</em> is the first synthetic log generation library openly available.

One function (in solid blue) models an effect that is maximum when no interventions are received (the nudging negatively impacts users whose behavior is modeled by it exclusively). Another function (in dotted black) represents an initial positive effect that eventually whines to zero. The final function (in dashed green) models an effect that builds up with increasing returns per nudge until it saturates at a constant level.

<div id="A2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The architecture for the adaptive intervention delivery framework for mobile health is as follows. The central piece is a data-centric platform that connects to the apps through the <em id="A2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HealthKit</em> SDK, which ensures all the information that is needed is tracked in a data schema optimized for data science and machine learning purposes. A use-case-specific data pipeline then turns the incoming information into actionable insights and metrics that are then readily available for visualization, and analysis, and to be consumed by (predictive and recommendation) ML models that produce additional metrics. The complete individual characterization provided by the resulting observational, predictive, and recommendation metrics is then available for the design of adaptive interventions. They are used to define the cohort of users that will be targeted, the content and scheduling of the interventions, and the state (or context, as we are limiting the discussion here to the use of contextual and restless bandits) and rewards for the RL component. The latter then uses the information to decide whether to assign subjects to treatment or control groups at each decision point in an adaptive experiment. In the case of adaptive interventions deployed in production, it decides whether to deliver or not or which of a finite set of interventions to deliver at each decision point for all users in the targeted cohort. This is schematically represented in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Mobile Health Log Synthetic Generator Architecture ‣ Synthetic Data Generator for Adaptive Interventions in Global Health" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> by the orange shaded block labeled <em id="A2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">platform</em> and the cohort of real users it is linked to.</p>
</div>
<div id="A2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The platform can integrate with the digital tools (and additional sources of digitalized information) through the <em id="A2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">HealthKit</em> SDK, which supports data collection in an opinionated data schema optimized for data science and ML, and which is also responsible for the delivery of content and messaging interventions back to the tool. It guarantees all incoming information into the platform is adequately tracked and organized.</p>
</div>
<div id="A2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the platform, incoming contextual, patient, and FHW data will be processed by use-case-specific data pipelines into useful metrics. All these metrics are then available to run statistical and ML models that will generate additional metrics. Cohorts are defined in terms of these metrics (e.g. FHWs that are predicted to underperform in their next evaluation) and constitute the basic unit of aggregate exploration and intervention. Interventions are defined and can use the available metrics to determine the content and scheduling of the interventions (e.g. content recommendation in the capacity building module as suggested by an ML model, sent in a push notification the next time they are predicted to be online). Intervention delivery is RL-based, and it is these metrics too that can be used to build the reward (e.g. number of questions answered correctly in in-app tests) and define the state for RL algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="A2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Interventions can combine clinical and behavioral elements. Clinical interventions fall into the realm of precision medicine and involve leveraging all the information available about a patient to improve quality of care and patient prognosis. Behavioral interventions aim at ensuring an adequate level of engagement (with the tool, program, and treatment) of medical care teams and patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="A2.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="A2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Once the interventions have been developed, their effect can be measured using the experimentation platform, which includes fully randomized and adaptive (bandit-based) designs, with and without multiple assignments.</p>
