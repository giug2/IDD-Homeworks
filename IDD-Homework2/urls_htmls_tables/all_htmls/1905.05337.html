<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Probabilistic record linkage (PRL) is the process of determining which records in two databases correspond to the same underlying entity in the absence of a unique identifier. Bayesian solutions to this problem provide a powerful mechanism for propagating uncertainty due to indeterminate links between records (via the posterior distribution over the linkage structures). However, computational considerations severely limit the practical applicability of many existing Bayesian methods. We propose a new computational approach that dramatically improves scalability of posterior inference, enabling Bayesian inference in problems orders of magnitude larger than many state-of-the-art algorithms. We use our methods to link a subset of an OCR’d dataset, the California Great Registers, containing hundreds of thousands of voter registrations spanning the New Deal realignment. Despite lacking a high quality blocking key our approach allows a posterior distribution to be estimated on a single machine in a matter of hours, enabling us to draw new inferences about party affiliation and switching from individual-level data over a critical time period in American politics.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Probabilistic record linkage (PRL) is the task of merging two or more databases that have entities in common but no unique identifier. Usually PRL must be done based on incomplete information – attributes may be incorrectly or inconsistently recorded, or may be missing altogether. Early developments of PRL were motivated by applications merging vital records and linking files from surveys and censuses to estimate population totals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">newcombe1959automatic</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">fellegi1969theory</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">jaro1989advances</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">copas1990record</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">winkler1991application</span>)</cite>.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Bayesian approaches to PRL provide an appealing framework for uncertainty quantification and propagation via posterior sampling of the unknown links between records. Bayesian methods have been deployed in a similar range of applied problems, including: Capture-recapture or multiple systems estimation, where the quantity of interest is a total population size <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">liseo2011bayesian</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">tancredi2011hierarchical</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">steorts2016bayesian</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">sadinle2014detecting</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">sadinle2017bayesian</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">sadinle2018bayesian</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">betancourt2016</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">tancredi2018</span>)</cite>, linking healthcare databases to estimate costs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">gutman2013bayesian</span>)</cite>, and merging educational databases to study student outcomes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">dalzell2018regression</span>)</cite>. In this paper we use Bayesian PRL to link extracts of the California Great Registers – historical voter registration rolls from the early 20th century <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">spahn2018before</span>)</cite> – with the goal of understanding how patterns of party affiliation were changing at the individual-level in the New Deal era.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One drawback of Bayesian approaches to PRL is their computational burden. In the best of circumstances Bayesian inference can be computationally demanding, and making inference over a large discrete structure (the unobserved links between records) is particularly difficult. Computational considerations have largely limited Bayesian inference for PRL to small problems, or large problems that can be effectively made small using clean quasi-identifiers through pre-processing steps known as indexing or blocking. For example, we may only consider sets of records as potential matches if they agree on one or more quasi-identifiers such as a geographic area or a partial name match.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, these pre-processing steps can lead to increased false non-match rates if the quasi-identifiers are subject to error. Moreover, many datasets lack the requisite clean quasi-identifying variables to make aggressive indexing or blocking feasible. Our application in this paper is one such example: Like many historical datasets, the Great Registers contain few recorded attributes available to perform record linkage, all of which are subject to nontrivial amounts of error. It is also large; the files we work with contain over 260,000 records apiece.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To apply Bayesian modeling to this problem we introduce an approach to approximate Bayesian inference for PRL that is model agnostic and can provide samples from posterior distributions over links between datasets with hundreds of thousands of records in a matter of hours on a desktop computer. We realize these gains using a data-driven approach we call “post-hoc blocking” that limits attention to distinct sets of record pairs where there is significant ambiguity about true match status, and therefore the most to gain from posterior sampling. Post-hoc blocking requires no labeled links/non-links (although it can utilize this data if available). Our methods build on previous work by

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Beginning in 1900, California counties were required to publish a typeset copy of their voter lists in each election year <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">spahn2018before</span>)</cite>, known as the California Great Registers, which contain the name, address, party registration and occupation of every registered voter. This served as a record of the county’s voters and as poll books on election day. The Great Registers provide a fine-grained tool for measuring the dynamics of partisan change over an especially interesting period of American history – the New Deal realignment. From 1928 to 1936, a substantial number of Americans switched their partisan allegiance from the Republicans (the party of Herbert Hoover) to the Democrats (the party of Franklin Roosevelt). While this change is known to have taken place at the macro-level, the Great Registers are the first dataset that follows this change at the individual level, provided we can link individual voters over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One quantity of interest to historians and political scientists is the frequency with which voters changed party affiliation from 1932 to 1936, during Roosevelt’s first term as president <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">erikson1981partisan</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">andersen1979creation</span>)</cite>. Decades of surveys conducted since 1948 have shown that voters rarely switch parties. But this earlier period, before modern polling, featured the most dramatic and rapid change in partisanship in the twentieth century, making individual-level panel data from this period especially interesting. In particular, individual-level panel data would enable a more detailed study of party switching behavior by demographic groups <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">sundquist1983dynamics</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">corder2016counting</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">norpoth2019american</span>)</cite>. To construct such a panel, we link records from the across the 1932 and 1936 registers based on the recorded name, address and occupation.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>While party might be an informative field in making a match, we withheld it from the matching process so that our estimate of the key quantity of interest – the party switching rate – is not biased toward stability.</span></span></span></p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Though the structure of the data is relatively simple, transferring it from the printed page into digital format is challenging. Ancestry.com scanned and performed optical character recognition (OCR) on the Great Registers, enabling use of the data by their subscribers for genealogical research. Since the quality of the scan as well as the original organization of the page can make the OCR fail to produce recognizable text or mistranscribe certain words and letters, much of the data was digitized imperfectly. Once digitized, the data require further processing and standardization which is also subject to error. These errors, coupled with natural variation (such as address changes and inconsistent recording of name variants and occupations), make linking challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Because erroneous matches will inflate the match rate (a randomly selected voter from 1932 will share a party affiliation with a randomly selected voter from 1936 49% of the time), making quality matches – and accounting for uncertainty in which records match – is essential to robustly estimating the party-switching rate. In addition to linking these two files, we also estimated false match rates to understand the performance of linkage algorithms and adjust our estimates, and compared the distribution of variables in the linked dataset to cross-sections of the Great Registers to help gauge whether differential false non-matching might threaten the representativeness of our linked sample.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider models for linking two files without any labeled true matching/non-matching pairs (“unsupervised” models). In particular we assume two files which have no duplicates, a special but important use case of PRL. Here a record from one file can match at most one record from the other. The (at most) “one-to-one” matching assumption is often useful even when the input files are not perfectly deduplicated, as it can provide useful regularization of posterior match probability estimates.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional approaches to reducing the number of potentially-matching record pairs can be separated into three categories: indexing, blocking, and filtering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">murray2016probabilistic</span>)</cite>. Indexing refers to any technique for excluding a record pair from consideration before performing a complete comparison; for example, we might exclude any record pairs with years of birth that differ by more than five. A blocking scheme is an indexing scheme that requires candidate record pairs to agree on a single derived comparison, known as a <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">blocking key</span>. This induces a nontrivial partition of the records such that all links must occur within elements of the partition (the blocks). For example, indexing by requiring that matching record pairs agree on a county and first initial defines a blocking scheme, since matches can only occur within blocks defined by the cross-product of letters and counties. Filtering refers to excluding record pairs <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">after</span> a complete comparison has been made. Little reference is made to filtering in the literature, but it is featured in many implementations of PRL (e.g. the U.S. Census Bureau’s BigMatch software <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">yancey2002bigmatch</span>)</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Reducing the number of comparisons by blocking is particularly attractive since it effectively leads to a collection of smaller PRL problems that can be solved in parallel. However, it is relatively rare to have a single blocking key that leads to an effective reduction in the number of candidate pairs without excluding many true matches in the process. Indexing is more common in practice (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">steorts2014comparison</span>)</cite> and Chapter 5 of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">christen2012data</span></cite> for recent reviews of indexing methods). A common indexing scheme is to combine of multiple blocking passes (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">winkler2010fast</span></cite> for a high-profile example), which <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">murray2016probabilistic</span></cite> calls indexing by disjunctions (of blocking keys). For example, we might include all record pairs that come from the same county <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">or</span> match on the first three characters of their first name. Indexing by disjunctions does not itself yield a blocking scheme, however. In the next subsection we describe a data-driven procedure for efficiently constructing blocks <span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">after</span> indexing, without requiring a set of labeled matching/non-matching record pairs.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given their computational complexity, Bayesian implementations of PRL can benefit from stricter blocking or indexing than other methods. Stricter indexing increases the risk of false non-matches, so it is important that the indexing be as efficient as possible by admitting plausibly matching record pairs while excluding clearly non-matching pairs. We propose constructing a high-quality blocking key from the available fields which separates most of the obviously non-matching pairs across blocks while keeping plausible matches within the same block. This is difficult to do via traditional indexing <span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a priori</span>, especially in the absence of labeled matches, so we suggest a data-driven approaches to choose the blocks (with or without labeled matching and non-matching pairs) – hence the name “post-hoc blocking”.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Post-hoc blocking is straightforward: First, perform traditional blocking or indexing only to the extent necessary to make computing comparison vectors feasible. Second, estimate matching weights or probabilities for each record pair. We refer to these generically as post-hoc blocking weights. The only criteria for these weights is that they reliably give relatively high weight to plausible matching pairs and low weight to true non-matching pairs; they need not be well-calibrated probabilities or proper likelihood ratios. Third, conduct an additional blocking pass using the estimated weights to construct the blocking key, reducing the number of record pairs just enough to make running an MCMC algorithm feasible. With the post-hoc blocks in hand, we run an MCMC algorithm as usual, restricting the proposal distribution to only consider matches within post-hoc blocks.</p>

However, compared to using the weights to <span id="S4.SS2.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">identify</span> truly matching pairs, for the purposes of post-hoc blocking we can tolerate lower quality weights. What is essential is that they give high weight to truly matching and ambiguous record pairs, while giving low weight to clearly non-matching pairs (so the blocks are compact). It is less important that the weights give a good rank ordering of the truly matching/ambiguous pairs – as long as they end up in the same post-hoc block, the Bayesian model and MCMC algorithm will treat them appropriately.</p>

Post-hoc blocking can achieve massive reductions in scale relative to traditional blocking schemes. Generally, a large number of small or singleton blocks are produced, in addition to a smaller number of larger blocks.

In large problems, an approximation of some sort seems unavoidable – it is infeasible to run any MCMC algorithm over datasets with hundreds of thousands of records generating hundreds of millions or billions of candidate record pairs (after indexing) sufficiently long to mix properly. The result is that in a practical MCMC run the vast majority of those entries we fix at zero would have posterior probabilities estimated at or near zero anyway.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We used the Jaro-Winkler similarity score to compare first name, surname, occupation, and street name fields. We compared the street number field with a Levenshtein distance, using zero-padding to ensure the distance is calculated between strings of equal length. The resultant string similarities were converted to comparison vectors by binning (Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.1.1 Construction of comparison vectors ‣ 5.1 Bayesian Model: Implementation Details ‣ 5 Linking the Great Registers: Alameda County ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).

We considered three cases: two full middle names present, two middle initial initials present, and a full middle name present in one record and only a middle initial in the other record. When two full names were present we used the same string comparison and cutoffs as for comparing first and surnames. For two initials, or one full name and one initial, we used exact matching between the first letter of the full name and the initial.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We relied on internal fastLink functions to block on first name, since fastLink was unable to use indexing by disjunctions by design. We used fastLink’s built-in clustering function to generate blocks of maximum size 10,000 by 10,000 – much larger than our post-hoc blocks – resulting in 123 distinct blocks containing 1.1 billion record pairs. To generate comparisons with fastLink we used the Jaro-Winkler similarity score on all fields except for female and street type, for which we rely on exact matching. We were limited to three categories for the string comparisons by the fastLink package, so we followed recommendations in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">winkler1990string</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">enamorado2018using</span></cite> to set string similarity cutoffs; similarity above 0.92 corresponded to an “exact” match, between 0.88 and 0.92 a partial match, and below 0.88 a non-match on the field.<span id="footnote6" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">6</span>In very recent versions of the fastLink package the default 0.92 similarity threshold for an “exact” match was increased to 0.94.</span></span></span>.</p>

Based on early inspection of the results we chose a cutoff of 0.9. Like other EM-based methods, fastLink does not incorporate a one-to-one matching constraint during estimation, so we relied on the fastLink’s deduplication procedure to produce a set of record pairs consistent with the one-to-one matching assumption. Roughly, the fastLink deduplication procedure limits declared matches to those record pairs for which the estimated posterior probability is the observed maximum for both records across all possible record pairs involving one of two records. In the case where multiple record pairs achieve the maximum, ties are broken by sampling uniformly among the candidates.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since the fastLink software was not able to accommodate some of the choices we made in our Bayesian model – specifically our approach to indexing and our use of more than three levels of string similarity – we also fit a version of the Bayesian model that used the same string similarity cutoffs and blocking procedure as fastLink. Results from the comparable model, presented in Section <a href="#A2.SS1" title="S.2.1 A Comparable Bayesian Model ‣ Appendix S.2 Extended Comparison of fastLink and the Bayesian Model ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">S.2.1</span></a> of the supplemental material, are very similar to our preferred Bayesian model.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compared the false match rate of fastLink and Bayesian estimators by manually confirming matches declared by one or both methods, blind to which method actually made the match.

For this exercise we needed to reduce the full Bayesian posterior over linkage structures to one set of declared links. We used a simple point estimate, classifying any record pair with a posterior match probability of greater than 0.5 as a match. This is the Bayes estimate under squared error or balanced misclassification loss functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">tancredi2011hierarchical</span>)</cite>. For the fastLink estimate we use a conservative threshold of 0.9, which is within the recommended range of 0.75 to 0.95 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">enamorado2018using</span>)</cite>. These two thresholds are not directly comparable – fastLink’s estimated matching probabilities are conditional on the block and are not proper posterior probabilities, since they fail to enforce the one-to-one constraint and often sum to values larger than one. By contrast, the posterior matching probabilities from our Bayesian model are proper probabilities and are not conditional on the indexing scheme due to our U-correction. We begin by comparing the point estimates, which guided our hand labeling, before turning to a more apples-to-apples comparison in the next subsection.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The two estimated sets of matches define three disjoint sets: record pairs classified as a match by both models; Bayesian only matches (record pairs classified as a match by our Bayesian model but not by fastLink); and fastLink only matches (record pairs classified as a match by fastLink but not by our Bayesian model). We further subdivided these sets of matches into two strata: “mover” and “non-mover” matches. We suspected that links made between individuals at different addresses would have higher error rates regardless of method. We defined a matched record pair as a “mover” if the string similarity between the street names was less than 0.85 or the similarity between the street numbers was less than 0.5<span id="footnote8" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">8</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">8</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">8</span>These similarity thresholds correspond to a similarity level of less than 5 for street name and less than 3 for street number as listed in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.1.1 Construction of comparison vectors ‣ 5.1 Bayesian Model: Implementation Details ‣ 5 Linking the Great Registers: Alameda County ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</span></span></span>.

This yielded 800 total pairs for labeling (400 mover matches and 400 non-mover matches). Each record pair was then labeled as either a false match (FM), a true match (TM), or no determination (ND) (for record pairs where there was not enough information to classify the record pair as either a match or a non-match with a reasonable level of confidence). The labeller was presented with the record pair under question, as well as similar records from each file, but was blind as to which method(s) had made the match.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Political scientists have postulated that the conversion of Republicans into Democrats was led by working class voters and women, arguing that more members of these groups switched parties than other segments of the electorate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">corder2016counting</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">sundquist1983dynamics</span>)</cite>. That such a change occurred is readily apparent in the Great Registers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">spahn2018before</span>)</cite>.
Based on cross-sectional data, before the realignment (in 1928) all demographic groups had a Democratic registration rate of about 20% <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">spahn2018before</span>)</cite>. This rate rose significantly during the realignment period, indicating that most party switches were from the Republicans to the Democrats. Among men registered with one of the two major parties, blue collar men were 21 percentage points more likely to be registered as a Democrat in 1936 than in 1932. Among white collar men, the change was just 14 points. In Alameda county, women and men moved about the same amount, each increasing their support for the Democrats by a bit less than 20 percentage points.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, cross-sectional data can only tell a limited story about party switching – for example, it is unable to disentangle the effects of party switching from differential turnout. A more nuanced picture can be drawn if individuals can be linked over time. Since name prefix and occupation are identified for individuals in the Great Registers, and gender can be inferred with a fairly high degree of confidence, given a set of links it is easy to estimate both the cross-sectional partisan composition and the party-switching rates for individuals registered in both years and aggregate up to groups in order to shed light on these theories.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we consider links generated by our Bayesian model and fastLink. To simplify the presentation of results, voters that were registered as neither Democrat nor Republican (10.4% in 1932 and 7.5% in 1936) in either of the two election years are excluded from the analysis in this section. The largest possible number of links between such individuals is 232,106 (the number of voters with a major party affiliation in the smaller 1932 register). In reality this is a very loose upper bound, as it would only be attainable if everyone in registered in 1932 with a major party affiliation also registered in 1936 in the same county (i.e. no drop-out, death, or out-migration).</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Fitting the Bayesian model produced a posterior mean of about 117,000 individuals linked across the two files with major party affiliation in both years. FastLink returned fewer links, identifying around 69,000 record pairs as matches. The composition of the linked sets were also markedly different; for example, both methods linked approximately the same <span id="S6.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">number</span> of movers, so the proportion of fastLink’s matches that are movers is about twice as high.</p>

However, when estimating the party switching rate it is necessary to account for uncertainty both in the individual links and in the total number of links. This setting does not seem to fit in the cases considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">enamorado2018using</span></cite>, and we are unaware of an adjustment that appropriately characterizes linkage uncertainty here using only the output provided by fastLink. Moreover, the fastLink estimated probabilities don’t seem to be well-calibrated posterior probabilities (see Table <a href="#A2.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ S.2.2 Examining other differences between the methods ‣ Appendix S.2 Extended Comparison of fastLink and the Bayesian Model ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> for an example), so any adjustment based on them is perhaps questionable.

With the exception of non-movers, fastLink consistently shows higher unadjusted rates of party-switching than the Bayesian model, save for the overall non-mover stratum where the two are nearly identical. This is consistent with our findings in Section <a href="#S5.SS3.SSS1" title="5.3.1 Estimating False Match Rates ‣ 5.3 Comparing the Bayesian model and fastLink ‣ 5 Linking the Great Registers: Alameda County ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3.1</span></a>, where fastLink’s higher overall false match rates were driven largely by its behavior in the mover stratum.</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">After adjustment most of the estimates exhibit better agreement between fastLink and the Bayesian model. So why do we prefer the Bayesian model over fastLink? First, the Bayesian method returns a much larger matched set – about 70% larger, or 48,000 links – with lower overall false match rate, and provides uncertainty intervals via the posterior distribution. Second, the estimates are not always brought in line by adjustments, for example in the case of married women in Fig <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 6.1 Party Switching Rates ‣ 6 Party Switching Rates in Alameda County ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. It seems reasonable to put more trust in the Bayesian model with its lover overall false match rate here, especially because it estimates a lower switching rate (consistent with making fewer false matches). Third, the adjustment is imperfect. It assumes that false matches occur at random and that the only variation in false match rates by demographic subgroup is due to the varying proportions of movers/non-movers within that group, both of which are likely oversimplifications. Relaxing these assumptions would require at minimum a much more extensive labeling exercise. Therefore we recommend choosing a method with low overall estimated false match rates, and then applying false match rate adjustments as feasible, treating this as a form of sensitivity analysis. We do not consider estimates from fastLink any further.</p>

The rightmost panel shows a stark difference in party switching rate between blue and white collar men (the rate is estimated at about 8.5%, regardless of bias adjustment).

This particular fact has been known at the group level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ladd1975transformations</span>)</cite>, but has never been demonstrated with individual-level data.</p>

While all groups switch to the Democratic party at a much higher rate than the Republican part, the group with the most lopsided switching is married women (followed by blue collar men).

<div id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Though it’s hard to say for sure why unmarried women (who are presumably younger) would have realigned less than their married women counterparts, one possibility is that they were more influenced by the parents who are older (and, on average, more Republican) than married women’s spouses, who are closer to the same age. The gap is not explained by different base rates of Democratic affiliation – in 1932, the unmarried and married women posterior mean rate of Democratic registration of 26.5% and 26.2%, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Of course, it may also be the case that our linked sample is somehow less representative for unmarried women than for other groups – in general, over this time period women are more difficult to link than men. However, for the estimands considered here, this differential non-linkage is only consequential if non-linkage <span id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">within</span> the stratum of unmarried women is correlated with party-switching. (This is why we focus on estimating rates rather than totals.) This seems relatively unlikely, although not impossible.
Finally, we note that our analysis cannot provide a complete picture of party affiliation for women over this period, as our analysis of women excludes those who marry between 1932 and 1936. The vast majority of these women would have changed their name and moved to a new address, and they are simply unlinkable using only the Great Registers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.SSS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To further understand the implications of potential differential false non-match rates, we compared the distribution of key demographics in 1932 and 1936 for the linked subsample to the distribution across the entire register in each year (Appendix <a href="#A3" title="Appendix C Comparing linked and cross-sectional populations ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C</span></a>). The distributions are rather close, particularly for marital status of women and occupation of men. Some observed differences are expected; our linked sample skews slightly male, likely due in part to reasons discussed above. Indeed, while we expect these distributions to be grossly similar, we would not expect all of them to match exactly even if linkage was done perfectly because of differential voter turnout (including drop-out and new registrations). For example, based on the increase in the total number of voters in 1936 and the increase in Democratic registration over 1932 we might expect the distribution of new registrants in 1936 to skew Democratic, which would tend to make a perfectly linked subsample (all of whom were registered in 1932) proportionally more Republican than the registered population in 1936. In fact, our linked sample skews slightly Republican by three percentage points in 1932 and five in 1936 (possibly due to compound effects of differential turnout and Republicans being on average older, wealthier, and more stable, and therefore easier to link).</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Bayesian probabilistic record linkage models provide an appealing framework for performing record linkage: They can provide accurate point estimates of links between records, and they allow for uncertainty in the links between to be quantified and propagated through to subsequent inference. The main barrier to their adoption in practice has been computational. Post-hoc blocking and restricted MCMC make Bayesian modeling for PRL feasible for much larger problems, as demonstrated by our analysis of the Great Registers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Linking our extract from the Great Registers provides new insight into party switching over one of the largest political realignments in American history. However, these insights are necessarily limited by the information available on the registration rolls. In particular we are missing important demographics like age and education, and variables like gender, marital status, and occupation type have to be reconstructed from attributes available on the file. It may be possible to obtain a more fine-grained picture of party switching by linking the registers to adjacent Census years to pick up more detailed demographic information about voters, provided these additional links can be made accurately. Similarly, using additional data sources like marriage records to help bridge the gap between election years could reduce error rates for difficult subpopulations, such as women who marry during the “off” years.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Clearly it would be useful to adapt our methods to link multiple files simultaneously, both for linking in the Great Registers and for many other applied problems. The computational challenges inherent in record linkage grow rapidly as we consider linking multiple files; see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">sadinle2013bayesian</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">steorts2015entity</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">steorts2016bayesian</span></cite> for some examples and discussion of model-based deduplication and multiple file linking. Adapting post-hoc blocking to the multiple file setting (and to files with duplicates) is a promising area for future work. We expect that the simplest multiple-file/de-duplication version of post-hoc blocking – stacking the multiple files and proceeding as in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Post-Hoc Blocking For Bayesian Record Linkage ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> as though we were matching this “meta” file to itself – should work well, provided adequate post-hoc blocking weights can be constructed.</p>

<p id="A1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Before constructing comparison vectors we undertake a number of pre-processing steps. The suffix field is coded as missing so frequently that we are forced to discard it entirely. Name prefix is also largely missing but is useful in that the vast majority of non-missing entries are either “mrs”, “ms”, or “miss” indicating that the individual is a woman, a feature which is not coded explicitly in the original data. We construct an indicator variable for probable females if one of these prefixes appears, or if the occupation is recorded as “housewife” or a variant thereof. We then code the occupation variable as missing for housewives, as chance agreement on occupation for housewives is very common.</p>

The street type was re-coded (e.g. mapping both “rd” and “road” to “road”) to standardize common abbreviations. The street name contains the remains of the original address field after removing the street number and street type from the original address string. We discarded records missing two or more of the first name, surname, occupation, and street name fields.</p>

This bias is introduced because, under any reasonable indexing or blocking scheme, the distribution of even non-matching comparison vectors will differ substantially between record pars within the scheme and those excluded from it. For example, in the indexing scheme employed for our Bayesian model (Section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1 Bayesian Model: Implementation Details ‣ 5 Linking the Great Registers: Alameda County ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>) we consider only record pairs which match on the first three digits of first or last name. By design the scheme excludes record pairs which are dissimilar on both first name and last name, the overwhelming majority of record pairs. This means that record pairs displaying low levels of similarity on first name or last name will be underrepresented, potentially massively so, relative to what would be observed if all comparison vectors were computed.</p>

That is, it is not necessary to calculate the full comparison vector for each record pair outside of the indexing or blocking scheme, only to determine frequency with which each similarity level would occur for each feature. This is a result of the fact that, under a conditional independence assumption, the likelihood factors in such a way that only the marginal frequencies with each group (match and non-match) are necessary as can be seen in (<a href="#S3.E5" title="In 3.2 Model and Prior Specification ‣ 3 Model-Based Probabilistic Record Linkage ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>).</p>

In total computing the full set of comparisons requires approximately 5 billion different comparisons. We note that while this is larger than the number of comparison vectors we generate for the analysis because multiple comparisons are required for each comparison vector even computing the full set of comparisons is less computationally costly than generating the comparison vectors. Furthermore, this is less than 1% of the nearly 675 billion comparisons that would be required if all possible comparison vectors were generated individually. While significantly more efficient approaches exist for generating the full set of comparison vectors (e.g. the implementation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">enamorado2018using</span></cite> using a hash table), at large scales other constraints, such as memory constraints, often become binding. Finally, while in our case we compute the marginal frequencies exactly it is possible to approximate them closely by computing similarities for record pairs generated via weighted random sampling of the unique values (with weights corresponding to observed frequencies). We refer to the inclusion of these frequencies as making a “U-correction” since the main effect is on the estimates of the <math id="A2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="u" display="inline"><semantics id="A2.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="A2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="A2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">u</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A2.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="A2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A2.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝑢</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A2.p4.1.m1.1c">u</annotation></semantics></math>-parameters.

The posterior distribution for the model with the U-correction (center) indicates both a larger mean number of estimated links, approximately 137,600 with the correction and only 87,200 without, as well as more dispersion in the number of links. The right panel shows the number of matches that would be returned by each model as a function of the posterior probability threshold for declaring a record pair a match. In addition to identifying more matches, for all match thresholds, the larger slope of the U-correction line indicates that the model identifies many more record pairs with a non-trivial level of uncertainty about the match status, perhaps better characterizing the matching uncertainty. An inspection of a set of links assigned a substantially high link probability by the model with the U-correction suggests that most of these additional links correspond to true matches. In particularly, essentially all of the mover matches identified by the Bayesian model discussed in Section <a href="#S5.SS3.SSS1" title="5.3.1 Estimating False Match Rates ‣ 5.3 Comparing the Bayesian model and fastLink ‣ 5 Linking the Great Registers: Alameda County ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3.1</span></a> are assigned a non-trivial link probability only by the model with the U-correction.</p>

<p id="A3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The lack of ground truth makes determining the representativness of the linked sample challenging to evaluate. In particular, if false non-matches are concentrated among particular subgroups then bias may be introduced into the analysis of the linked data. To examine this possibility we compare the marginal distributions of different subgroups observed in observed record pairs with those in the linked sample. We report marginal distributions for gender and female marital status in Table <a href="#A3.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ Appendix C Comparing linked and cross-sectional populations ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.

<div id="A3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The tables indicate that there is a high degree of similarity between the observed marginal distributions and those in the linked sample. Table <a href="#A3.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ Appendix C Comparing linked and cross-sectional populations ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> shows that in the linked sample men are over represented relative to women and married women are over represented relative to unmarried women. In both cases the findings are unsurprising as the over represented groups, men and married women, would generally be thought easier to link, relative to all women and unmarried women respectively. However, the discrepancy is a slight, with a maximum discrepancy between population shares is 0.03 in Table <a href="#A3.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ Appendix C Comparing linked and cross-sectional populations ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. The difference between observed and linked marginal distributions of white collar and blue collar workers is even smaller, just 0.01, as shown in the left panel of Table <a href="#A3.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ Appendix C Comparing linked and cross-sectional populations ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. The right panel of Table <a href="#A3.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ Appendix C Comparing linked and cross-sectional populations ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> shows the marginal distributions in party membership. The differences between marginal distributions of party membership in the observed and linked samples are somewhat larger, up to 0.05, than in other subgroups. However, we note that from 1932 to 1936 saw both an overall shift towards to Democratic party and a substantial increase in the number of registered voters. By definition any new voters will be excluded from the linked sample since they are not present in the 1932 records. If these new voters are heavily skewed towards the Democratic party, as it likely the case, then we would expected a representative linked sample to contain a higher share of Republican voters than the voter registrations overall. This is exactly what is observed with the observed and linked distributions of party membership for 1932 matching more closely than those for 1936. Thus, while there are minor compositional differences between the observed and linked data in general the share of different subgroups display a surprisingly high level of agreememnt.</p>

<div id="A1a.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1a.p1.1" class="ltx_p">High-quality weights are important for efficient implementation of the post-hoc blocking algorithm. In applications of PRL to historical data we often have relatively few fields available to perform matching, many or all of which are subject to error. At the same time we know that the constituent files are at least approximately de-duplicated, so imposing a one-to-one matching constraint makes sense. We also have limited or no labeled matching and non-matching record pairs with which to construct weights or validate results, suggesting the use of EM-estimated Fellegi-Sunter weights in post-hoc blocking.</p>

<div id="A1a.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1a.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, we have observed that in this setting (one-to-one matching with a small number of noisy fields) the Fellegi-Sunter weights can be unreliable.

<p id="A1.SS2.SSS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Even greater benefits can be realized by partitioning the sparse weight matrix to derive many small optimization problems to be solved in parallel. Similar to our procedure for obtaining post-hoc blocks, we can employ graph clustering to separate the records into blocks (defined by the connected components of the weighted graph defined by the thresholded post-hoc blocking weights) such that links are only possible within and not across blocks. This allows us to decompose the full assignment problem into a set of smaller problems that can be solved in parallel, as summarized in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ S.1.2.1 Solving Sparse Thresholded Assignment Problems ‣ S.1.2 Maximal Weights for Post-Hoc Blocking ‣ Appendix S.1 Post-Hoc Blocking Weights under One-to-One Constraints ‣ Scaling Bayesian Probabilistic Record Linkage with Post-Hoc Blocking: An Application to the California Great Registers" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

In addition to its performance guarantees, the auction algorithm allows us to use previous solutions to specify initial values for new problems. This is useful in the iterative maximization problems in both the penalized maximum likelihood and the maximal weight procedure. Further, we have the option to stop the auction algorithm early to save on computation time. This is useful in penalized likelhood estimation, where we need not necessarily find the optimal assignment in order to improve the objective function at each step.

The data in this example come from a small geographic area; there are 34 records from the census (file A) and 45 records from the post-enumeration survey (file B). The goal is to identify the number of overlapping records to obtain an estimate of the number of people missed by the census count using capture-recapture methods. This small scale example allows us to compare the results of estimation performed employing post-hoc blocking with the results from considering the full set of record pairs.</p>

The EM weights consider a record pair agreeing on sex and education alone to be a more probable match than a record pair agreeing on last name and sex, assigning such record pairs weights of 2.68 and -0.94 respectively. While we have no ground truth here, this seems unlikely. More striking is the EM weight assigned to record pairs that agree solely on education – its value of 1.18 under this model would suggest that these such a pair is more likely than not a true match.

The full and restricted MCMC probabilities are quite similar, except the small cluster of points on the x-axis near the origin. These are points that had modest posterior probability – less than 0.12 – in the full MCMC but were excluded from the post-hoc blocks and assigned zero probability in the approximate posterior. Even in this small example we obtain a significant improvement in runtimes: Using identical implementations posterior sampling takes 3.4 seconds for the full MCMC algorithm versus 0.32 seconds when employing post-hoc blocks.

Thus, it is not immediately obvious from the examination of the presented faslse match rates which of these differences is the driver for the lower false match rates produced by the Bayesian model. We therefore estimate the linkage structure of the Alameda county voter files using a second Bayesian model, our “Comparable” model, on the set of record pairs and comparison vectors used by the fastLink estimation procedure.

<p id="A2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We begin our comparisons of the model results with an examination of the differences in the indexing schemes. The blocking used for fastLink and the Comparable model consider a total of 1.1 billion record pairs, compared to the 850 million record pairs included in the indexing scheme developed for the Bayesian model. While there is a substantial degree of overlap, a total of 630 million pairs appear in both indexing schemes, the overlap among record pairs with a high posterior link probability is more substantial. Of the 132,331 record pairs for which the Bayesian model estimates a posterior link probability greater than 0.5, 119,625 (90.3%) are included in the fastLink blocking scheme. The Bayesian model indexing scheme
includes an even greater fraction of the links estimated by the Comparable model, containing 116,345 (99.9%) of the 117,477 record pairs assigned a posterior match probability greater than 0.5 by this model. The overlap with the fastLink results is less but still substantial, with the Bayesian model indexing scheme containing only 65,035 (82.1%) of the 79,228 record pairs assigned a posterior link probability greater than 0.9 by fastLink.</p>

<p id="A2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">It is clear that between the Comparable model and fastLink there is essential zero agreement on posterior link probability, outside of the near certain non-links (bottom left) and near certain links (top right) record pairs. In contrast, the Bayesian model and the Comparable model plot shows substantial mass near the diagonal, indicating broad agreement on the posterior link probabilities. This occurs despite the models relying on different comparison vectors. There does exist a set of several thousand record pairs for which the Comparable model estimates zero link probability which the Bayesian model classifies as near certain links (shown in the top left corner of the right panel). However, upon further examination we determined that this disagreement is the result of differences in indexing scheme already described rather than different estimates for record pairs included in both models. Overall it is clear that there is substantially more agreement between the Bayesian and Comparable models, both estimated using our post-hoc blocking procedure, suggesting that the choice of estimation procedure is significantly more important in determining model performance than specifics of the comparison vectors or blocking scheme.</p>

It does not appear that this assumption is reasonable in our application. Consider the case where random agreement on a field is relatively common but transcription errors are either uncommon or, more plausibly, result in the a comparison falling into the lowest similarity bucket. In this scenario partial agreements may be observed less frequently than either matching comparisons among non-matched record pairs (due to random agreement) or non-matching comparisons among matched record pairs (due to parsing or transcription errors). This would violate the constraints imposed by fastLink and result in parameter estimates on the boundary.</p>

This makes sense, as occupations are often inconsistently recorded in a fashion leading to low similarity scores (a “stevedore” in 1932 might report his occupation as a “dockworker” in 1936) and addresses are subject to seemingly random failures in the OCR and parsing. We might correct some of these effects with better preprocessing (e.g. more intensive standardization of occupations), but both addresses and occupations are subject to change over time. If these changes occur at a higher rate than minor typographical or OCR errors leading to partial agreement then the constraint would still be violated.</p>

While fastLink’s deduplication procedure makes the correct links here, the estimated matching probabilities are clearly nonsensical. And importantly, if the William Brown on Outlook Ave. had failed to register in 1936 then fastLink would have happily linked him to one of the other two records, as removing a single record pair has almost no influence on the estimated model parameters.</p>
