<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL), thanks in part to the emergence of the edge computing paradigm, is expected to enable true real-time applications in production environments. However, its original dependence on a central server for orchestration raises several concerns in terms of security, privacy, and scalability. To solve some of these worries, blockchain technology is expected to bring decentralization, robustness, and enhanced trust to FL. The empowerment of FL through blockchain (also referred to as <em id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FLchain</em>), however, has some implications in terms of ledger inconsistencies and age of information (AoI), which are naturally inherited from the blockchain’s fully decentralized operation. Such issues stem from the fact that, given the temporary ledger versions in the blockchain, FL devices may use different models for training, and that, given the asynchronicity of the FL operation, stale local updates (computed using outdated models) may be generated. In this paper, we shed light on the implications of the FLchain setting and study the effect that both the AoI and ledger inconsistencies have on the FL performance. To that end, we provide a faithful simulation tool that allows capturing the decentralized and asynchronous nature of the FLchain operation.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Edge intelligence, by means of edge computing, is expected to bring artificial intelligence (AI) applications and optimizations closer to users by providing low-latency responses both in training and inference phases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the edge computing paradigm is expected to provide more efficient usage of resources for handling massive amounts of user-generated data with respect to traditional centralized learning approaches, typically hosted at large data centers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One paradigm increasing in popularity to enable edge intelligence is federated learning (FL), whereby a set of participants exchange model parameters to build a collaborative model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. FL has been typically realized through the orchestration of a central server, which is responsible for gathering local updates computed by FL clients, aggregating the information to generate a new version of the global model, and distributing new models to clients. Following this approach, an FL algorithm can potentially reduce the overheads and enhance the privacy of its centralized counterpart.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The traditional centralized FL approach, however, has serious disadvantages that prevent its adoption in many large-scale settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. First, the central server represents a bottleneck and a single point of failure, which can potentially compromise performance and security. Second, given the devices’ heterogeneity in terms of computation, communication, and availability, centralized FL entails issues related to fault tolerance (e.g., straggler effect). Moreover, the orchestration of FL devices depends on a single server, typically controlled by a single entity, which is detrimental to the democratization of the training procedure. In this regard, an arbitrary set of devices could be selected in each FL iteration to satisfy the interests of a single party, therefore leading to biased models (e.g., taking into consideration only portions of data that are relevant for the orchestrator).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address the issues of centralization in FL, we focus our attention on blockchain, which can enable a secure, reliable, and transparent server-less realization of FL, i.e., <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FLchain</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. By means of cryptographic proof, blockchain provides trust to a federated ecosystem whereby multiple (often unreliable) parties can cooperate to train a collaborative global, each one providing insights into their own data. In FLchain, blockchain nodes (e.g., miners) maintain a distributed ledger that stores FL model updates in blocks that are generated at regular intervals. To secure the data and achieve consistency (i.e., nodes should agree on the same history of the ledger), miners run a mining mechanism like Proof-of-Work (PoW) and apply a certain set of consensus rules (e.g., the main chain is the one with more power invested).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The FLchain solution, on the one hand, allows removing the single-point-of-failure problem of centralized FL, thus solving scalability issues, and providing enhanced trust thanks to blockchain properties. On the other hand, the blockchain’s decentralized architecture leads naturally to an asynchronous operation whereby local updates are shared as they become available, without any kind of coordination. Moreover, FL devices may use potentially different global models for training, as a result of the temporary inconsistencies in the ledger (for instance, due to forks).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we aim to shed light on the implications of the server-less FL operation when realized through blockchain technology. In particular, we focus on the asynchronous nature of the learning procedure and on the ledger inconsistencies that stem from the blockchain operation, whose impact remains unclear. More specifically, we delve into the effects of using stale and disparate model updates in FL training. In this regard, we feature an age of information (AoI)-based metric <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, introduced as age of block (AoB), to evaluate the freshness of model updates in FLchain.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The trend of distributing and decentralizing ML operations has been embraced as an appealing solution for addressing many issues of centralization (connectivity, privacy, and security). One appealing distributed learning solution is FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, whereby different devices collaborate to train a model by exchanging model parameters that are obtained from local (and unshared) data. The FL framework has received a lot of attention in the recent years, and its implementation in real-world applications is extensive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, traditional FL settings still require the figure of a central server, responsible for clients orchestration and model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A prominent solution to fully decentralize FL is FLchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, where a blockchain system allows FL clients to submit and retrieve model updates without the need for a central server. Blockchain technology, beyond enabling decentralization, provides important enablers for trust, including security, privacy, and traceability, thus outperforming other existing decentralized FL solutions like the ones in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> (based on gossip learning) or <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> (based on BitTorrent). FLchain, thanks to the abovementioned blockchain properties, opens the door to an unprecedented way of building powerful collaborative ML models through the participation of multiple untrusted parties, and without the need for any regulating third party. In this regard, we find FLchain realizations for novel use cases like autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> or fog computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For further details on the integration of FL and blockchain, we refer the interested reader to the surveys in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While promising decentralization and trust, FLchain entails a set of limitations that, to the date, have been barely studied. One important consequence of the architectural shift to decentralization stems from the way model updates are included into blockchain blocks. Unlike for centralized settings where a server decides the set of participating users in each FL round, in blockchain, FL clients submit model updates asynchronously. Moreover, these local updates are incorporated into blocks of different length, which depends on blockchain configuration parameters like the maximum block size and the block interval. An important aspect of asynchronous learning stems from the fact that FL devices may contribute to global training with outdated models (i.e., models that have been updated using past gradient information, or models that have not been updated at all). This poses a set of interesting challenges and trade-offs for incorporating data from slow devices. The asynchronous property of FLchain has been considered in a limited (and recent) number of contributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The other important implication of FLchain is related to the temporal inconsistencies of the ledger across blockchain nodes, which results from the partitioning of the blockchain due to forks. Since blockchain nodes provide global models to FL devices, forking events may lead FL nodes to train on different models. This aspect has not been examined in the literature and, typically, blockchain systems have been assumed to act as a central server with a perfect synchronization among blockchain nodes (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>). In this paper, we focus on realistic implementations of FLchain, where FL devices carry out the asynchronous training operation in the presence of ledger inconsistencies. Moreover, we delve into the effect of incorporating or working with old models as a result of the asynchronous FL operation implicit in blockchain architecture. For that purpose, we study the staleness problem and analyze the AoI of the FL models generated by FL devices.</p>

The version of the ledger accepted by the majority of the miners is referred to as the main chain. However, since any participating miner can generate blocks, different miners may come across a valid solution for appending a block with the same depth simultaneously, which would lead to forks (i.e., divergent (inconsistent) histories of the ledger). These inconsistencies are eventually solved thanks to consensus, which states that the longest chain (i.e., the one with the highest invested computational power) is the valid one. The longest chain is also referred to as main chain in the rest of paper. Accordingly, as the main chain increases, miners working on forked chains will abandon their chains and switch to the valid one. In the literature (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>), a widely adopted assumption is that all the FL clients in FLchain can perfectly access the blockchain’s main chain simultaneously, thus disregarding the effect of temporal ledger inconsistencies.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We study the impact of the the introduced AoB metric on the learning performance under different types of blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum) and blockchain parameters (e.g., the maximum block size). The targeted FL application is based on hand-written digits recognition. For that, we define a four-layered feed-forward neural network (FNN) model (with 784, 200, 200, and 10 neurons in each layer), which is trained individually by FL clients using SGD on the well-known MNIST dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, whose weights are aggregated using FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 and 10,000 data samples for training and test, respectively. For evaluation purposes, we have further split the test dataset into test (30%) and validation (70%).</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the performance of FLchain in the main chain, which would match clients’ performance if the blockchain’s information could be simultaneously accessed by all the FL nodes across the network (i.e., without experiencing ledger inconsistencies). This assumption has been widely adopted in the literature but, as shown in the next subsections, does not hold in reality due to the network heterogeneity and temporal forks in the blockchain. Nevertheless, the main chain’s accuracy is a solid indicator of the overall performance.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An important consideration of FLchain lies in the models used by individual FL devices for training. These models are retrieved from the closest miner latest block, which, due to the blockchain’s decentralized operation, may not be the same for all the FL clients. One remarkable reason for such type of inconsistencies lies in forks, which occur when two or more miners generate a valid block simultaneously. The acceptance of inconsistent blocks leads to forks, which create different temporary versions of the ledger. These types of forks are eventually solved thanks to the consensus protocol that states that the longest chain (the chain with the highest invested computational power) is the valid one. Nevertheless, during the FL operation, different FL devices can potentially work with different models in case forks occur.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FLchain emerges as an appealing solution for secure and robust decentralized learning framework. However, the implications that decentralization of blockchain technology have on FL optimization have not been studied closely yet. In this paper, we have studied the implications of running an FL application in a blockchain, including the temporal inconsistencies and the age of information that are implicit in such a technology. To do so, we have proposed a simulation tool (Block<span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FL</span>sim, an extension of BlockSim) for realistic FLchain operation. Our results show that both the age of information and model inconsistencies (forks) have a low impact on the accuracy of an FL application (trained with the MNIST dataset) running over a blockchain. This result suggests that FL is a robust framework that works effectively even if clients use outdated information or different models for collaborative training. Future work includes studying more complex datasets with unbalanced settings and non-IID data.</p>
