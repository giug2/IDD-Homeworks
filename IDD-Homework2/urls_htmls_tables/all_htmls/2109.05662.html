<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Building fair machine learning models becomes more and more important. As many powerful models are built by collaboration among multiple parties, each holding some sensitive data, it is natural to explore the feasibility of training fair models in cross-silo federated learning so that fairness, privacy and collaboration can be fully respected simultaneously. However, it is a very challenging task, since it is far from trivial to accurately estimate the fairness of a model without knowing the private data of the participating parties. In this paper, we first propose a federated estimation method to accurately estimate the fairness of a model without infringing the data privacy of any party. Then, we use the fairness estimation to formulate a novel problem of training fair models in cross-silo federated learning. We develop FedFair, a well-designed federated learning framework, which can successfully train a fair model with high performance without any data privacy infringement. Our extensive experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate the excellent fair model training performance of our method.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fairness and collaboration are among the top priorities in machine learning and AI applications. As accurate machine learning models are deployed in more and more important applications, enhancing and ensuring fairness in machine learning models becomes critical for AI for social good <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At the same time, in order to build effective machine learning models for sophisticated applications, such as finance and medicare, more often than not, many parties,
such as financial institutions or medical care organizations,
have to collaborate and contribute their own private data.
A key to successful collaborations is to fully protect the privacy of every party. However, it is a grand challenge to facilitate collaboration among parties to build fair machine learning models while preserving their data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are many recent breakthroughs in enhancing fairness in machine learning models (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> for a survey and Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="II-A Fairness Enhancing Methods ‣ II Related Works ‣ FedFair: Training Fair Models In Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-A</span></span></a> for a brief review). There are also many efforts in cross-silo federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to enable privacy preserving collaboration between tens or hundreds of companies and organizations in building effective machine learning models. However, only very recently there are some initiatives to develop federated learning methods for building fair machine learning models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Can we easily extend the existing fairness enhancing methods to accommodate the need of collaboration and privacy preservation? As analyzed in Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="II-A Fairness Enhancing Methods ‣ II Related Works ‣ FedFair: Training Fair Models In Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-A</span></span></a>, the existing fairness enhancing methods are mainly designed with an assumption of a unified available training data set, and thus cannot easily address the need of distributed collaboration, such as cross-silo federated learning, as well as privacy preservation for participating parties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Alternatively, can we easily extend the existing federated learning, the prominent collaboration and privacy preserving framework, to enforce fairness in model building? Unfortunately, the answer is still no. As analyzed in Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="II-B Fair Models and Federated Learning ‣ II Related Works ‣ FedFair: Training Fair Models In Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span></span></a>, the existing federated learning methods do not consider the fairness of machine learning models at all. Moreover, in order to obtain fairness of a model as the intermediate result on the training data of each party, a straightforward design may likely infringe privacy of the parties, such as leaking the distribution information about the data of the parties.
As discussed in Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="II-B Fair Models and Federated Learning ‣ II Related Works ‣ FedFair: Training Fair Models In Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-B</span></span></a>, even AgnostiFair <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, the only existing method claiming to combine federated learning and fairness, is pretty primitive and does not guarantee the requirement of privacy preservation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we tackle the novel problem of training fair models in cross-silo federated learning. We systematically model the problem and develop a comprehensive solution that theoretically guarantees both the fairness and privacy preservation requirements. Our key idea is to carefully design the fairness constraint so that it can be enforced in the whole learning process in a federated manner. In other words, the fairness constraint is implemented in a fully collaborative and privacy preserving way. Moreover, the problem of training fair models in cross-silo federated learning presents a challenging optimization problem to maximize accuracy and ensure fairness. To solve the problem we develop an elegant solution based on alternating gradient projection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> in optimization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We make the following contributions.
First, we propose a federated estimation method to accurately estimate the fairness of a model without infringing the data privacy of any party.
Second, we prove that the federated estimation method is more accurate than locally estimating the fairness of a model on individual parties, which leads to a superior fair model training performance in cross-silo federated learning.
Third, by incorporating the model fairness estimation as a fairness constraint with a widely adopted federated loss function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, we formulate our novel FedFair problem. We also develop an effective federated learning framework to tackle this problem without infringing the data privacy of any party.
Last, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superior fair model training performance of FedFair on three real-world datasets.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fairness has been recognized more and more important in machine learning and AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Correspondingly, fairness enhancing methods improve fairness in machine learning models. Please see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> for a thorough survey.
The existing methods can be categorized into three groups, namely
pre-processing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>,
post-processing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>

enhance fairness of models by rectifying training data.
The early methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> modify the labels of some training instances that are close to the decision boundary.
The recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> adjust the feature representations of training data to reduce the influence of fairness-sensitive features on the model training process.
Those methods collect and pre-process all training data together, and thus are not applicable to federated learning, since in federated learning the private data sets of participating parties are not allowed to be exposed to or collected by any other parties.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The post-processing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> revise the prediction scores of a machine learning model to make predictions fairer than those by the original model. For example, Hardt et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> flip some decisions of a classifier to make it fairer. Corbett et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and Menon et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> comprehensively consider the influence of modifying prediction scores on prediction accuracy.
Those methods are compatible with many trained models.
However, since they are applied at a late stage in the learning process, those methods usually cannot obtain a good fairness and may sometimes sacrifice considerable accuracy of a model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

For example, Agarwal et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> propose a reduction method for building fair classifiers.
Based on the reduction method, Agarwal et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> further propose an in-process minimax optimization formulation to enhance the fairness of regression tasks.
Quadrianto et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> extend logistic regression into a multi-objective loss function, which combines fair representation learning with an in-process model training algorithm.
Most in-processing methods are tightly coupled with specific machine learning algorithms and need to know all training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, they are not applicable to federated learning, either, due to infringements of the data privacy of participating parties.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our method also customizes the learning process to directly train fair models. However, it is dramatically different from the in-processing methods, since our method lets multiple parties collaborate to train fair models without infringing their data privacy.</p>

A straight-forward extension to train fair models is to apply fairness constraints locally on each participating party.

However, it cannot fully protect data privacy because learning the reweighing values needs strong prior knowledge on the data distribution and also requires sensitive information that leaks the data distribution of every participating party.</p>

Using a similar idea, Lyu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and Sim et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> achieve a better collaborative fairness performance by directly using model accuracy as the reward for the parties.
Some other works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> advocate egalitarian equity in the collaboration by optimizing the performance of the party with the worst performance.
The collaborative fairness task is substantially different from our study, because our task focuses on enhancing the fairness of a machine learning model, but the collaborative fairness task focuses on the fairness of the collaboration relationship among participating parties in the federated learning process.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many fairness measurements have been proposed in literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
But only a few of them are suitable for training fair models in a federated learning framework.
In this section, we review existing fairness measures and discuss their applicability to training fair models in a federated manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing model fairness measurements can be categorized into two major groups.
The individual fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> measures the fairness of a model by evaluating how likely a pair of similar instances receive similar predictions from the model.
The group fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> measures model fairness by evaluating how balanced the predictions of a model are on a pre-defined pair of protected groups (e.g., ‘female’ versus ‘male’).
It is well recognized that individual fairness measurements are less stable than group fairness measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Thus, in this paper, we focus on group fairness measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Many group fairness measurements such as disparate impact <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, demographic parity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, equal odds and equal opportunities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> are developed based on the prediction accuracy of a model.
However, since the prediction accuracy of a model is a non-smooth and non-differentiable function, it is very difficult, if not impossible at all, to formulate such a fairness measurement as a fairness constraint embedded into a federated model training algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle this problem, some methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> convert prediction accuracy based measurements into smooth surrogate constraints. But the fairness performance of the trained models is limited by the approximation error between the surrogate constraints and the original fairness measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Xu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and Cotter et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> propose a series of fairness measurements that can be smoothly integrated into a training process.
However, those methods are still not applicable to our task, because they require to know some proportions of instances contained in each of the protected groups and thus infringe the data privacy of the participating parties by revealing the distributions of their private data over the protected groups.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we discuss how to solve the FedFair problem and the LCO problem without infringing the data privacy of any client.
We first convert the FedFair problem to a nonconvex-concave min-max problem. Then, we apply the alternating gradient projection (AGP) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> to
tackle the min-max problem without infringing the data privacy of any client.
We also extend AGP to tackle the LCO problem in a similar privacy-preserving way.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we tackle the novel task of training fair models in cross-silo federated learning. We first propose an effective federated estimation method to accurately estimate the fairness of a model, and we also analyze why it achieves a smaller estimation variance than locally estimating the fairness of a model on every client.
Based on the federated estimation, we develop a fairness constraint that can be smoothly incorporated into an effective federated learning framework to train high-performance fair models without infringing the data privacy of any client.</p>
