<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Since federated learning (FL) has been introduced as a decentralized learning technique with privacy preservation, statistical heterogeneity of distributed data stays the main obstacle to achieve robust performance and stable convergence in FL applications. Model personalization methods have been studied to overcome this problem. However, existing approaches are mainly under the prerequisite of fully labeled data, which is unrealistic in practice due to the requirement of expertise. The primary issue caused by partial-labeled condition is that, clients with deficient labeled data can suffer from unfair performance gain because they lack adequate insights of local distribution to customize the global model. To tackle this problem, 1) we propose a novel personalized semi-supervised learning paradigm which allows partial-labeled or unlabeled clients to seek labeling assistance from data-related clients (helper agents), thus to enhance their perception of local data; 2) based on this paradigm, we design an uncertainty-based data-relation metric to ensure that selected helpers can provide trustworthy pseudo labels instead of misleading the local training; 3) to mitigate the network overload introduced by helper searching, we further develop a helper selection protocol to achieve efficient communication with acceptable performance sacrifice. Experiments show that our proposed method can obtain superior performance and more stable convergence than other related works with partially labeled data, especially in highly heterogeneous setting.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Over the recent years, with the expansion of personal mobile devices and wireless networks, the amount of user data has witnessed tremendous growth at the edge side. To reap the benefits of large-scale data, machine learning based smart services have been investigated in massive studies (e.g., image classification [1], nature language processing [2] and speech recognition [3]), and achieved remarkable success. However, these techniques require to gather scattered user data into a single dataset and train model centrally. While in real-world applications, collecting distributed data to a central server is usually unrealistic due to the data privacy and commercial competition. In this regard, federated learning (FL) [4] has been proposed as a distributed learning algorithm which aims to collaboratively train a global deep learning model without sharing local data. Unlike centralized training, engaged clients in FL undertake the model training task, while the central server conducts the information aggregation via the weighted average of local parameters. In canonical FL, a single training round mainly includes following steps: 1) the central server samples a subset of clients and distributes the global model to them; 2) selected clients train the global model with their private data and upload the modified models back to server; 3) the central server aggregates the local models to update the global model, which is used for next training round. In FL system, the server and clients iteratively perform the above three stages until the model converged.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the communication-efficient pattern and privacy-preserved information aggregation procedure, FL has been widely utilized in advanced applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT) [5] and smart healthcare [6]. Nevertheless, FL still faces three major challenges to obtain guaranteed convergence rate and appropriate generalization ability to unseen data. One challenge is the statistic heterogeneity of users’ local datasets, also named non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. In this setting, the local models learned by clients are prone to interfere each other in the aggregation stage, leading to unstable convergence rate and inferior performance. Several prior works have been proposed to address the issues caused by Non-IID data. For instance, Li et al. in [7] proposed the regularization method to constrain the model drift in the local training stage, which achieves more stable convergence than conventional FL. Other studies like [8] sought to adjust the gradient directions of different clients to prevent the interference involved in central aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While these works effectively resolve the model conflicting effect induced in Non-IID FL, modifying or eliminating the skew of local parameters might cause the performance unfairness, which means the generalization ability of the global model to different clients diverges to a large extent. Building a model that can be fairly generalized to distinct clients is the second challenge of FL. In order to preserve the local update directions and mitigate the performance bias, some studies [9], [10] and [11] considered the model personalization in federated learning, namely the personalized federated learning (pFL). The pFL based methods allow each participant to maintain a personalized model while still derive benefit from collaborative training. Under the strong assumption that all on-device data are fully labeled, these methods have achieved the comparably fair performance in each client.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In realistic applications, the available labeled data distributed in multiple sources can be limited. For instance, in medical image classification field, due to the laborious and expert-requiring labeling procedure, the labeled data can be quite restricted in personal devices or non-professional institutions. To overcome this limitation, some previous works proposed to directly implement conventional semi-supervised methods in client side [12] or modify these techniques to adjust the FL setting [13]. However, these works ignore the primary issue of federated learning in semi-supervised scenarios, which is the performance fairness for clients. Under the partial-labeled and Non-IID data condition, clients with scarce labeled data will struggle to obtain competent personalized models due to insufficient knowledge of their local data distributions, while those with adequate labeled data can dominate the collaborative training and obtain superior performance. Thus, concern about performance fairness resurfaces as a main challenge for FL applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study the uncertainty minimization for personalized federated semi-supervised learning (UM-pFSSL) to address these three challenegs in semi-supervised scenario: (1) data heterogeneity of engaged clients; (2) the lack of knowledge to personalized the global model; (3) performance fairness to local data distributions. The main contributions of which include:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">1) We present a novel semi-supervised learning paradigm for pFL, which aims to tackle the performance bias that stems from partial-labeled and Non-IID data in realistic applications. In this paradigm, partial-labeled or unlabeled clients can selectively extract knowledge from data-related clients to annotate the unlabeled data locally. Supervised training on these pseudo labels enables the clients efficiently mining the information of unlabeled data and resolves the dilemma of insufficient insights into local data distributions, so as to achieve fairer performance. After that, benefited clients can further spread out their knowledge extracted from federation by providing labeling assistance to others, which strengthens the knowledge sharing efficiency of FL system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">2) A potential threat of learning from peer nodes is that, clients who received detrimental knowledge (i.e., counterfactual pseudo labels) tend to promptly poison the entire federation through the knowledge feedback procedure. To obviate this risk, we define an uncertainty-based data-relation metric. Based on which, each client can effectively select relevant helpers which are more apt to provide trustworthy predictions for local unlabeled data. Furthermore, with the theoretical guarantee, aggregating the parameters from selected helpers can further improve the generalization ability of each client.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">3) Greedily searching helpers from federation is prone to bring huge communication cost to the system. To exempt the extra network burden, we design a ranking update protocol for helper selection. Specifically, rather than applying selection to the complete client group, each client chooses to randomly download a small subset of external models and evaluates the data-relation accordingly. Thereafter, irrelevant models of former rounds will be replaced with more relevant ones in current round. This replacing procedure only executes in the early few rounds, and selected helpers will be updated periodically through the server’s model pool. By applying this protocol, our scheme saves considerable communication overhead with acceptable performance sacrifice.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, we compare the UM-pFSSL with Non-IID methods and personalized methods in heterogeneous partial-labeled setting. The results show that our proposed scheme can achieve more robust performance, superior convergence rate and comparable fairness than compared methods without introducing extra communication cost.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the advantages in privacy preservation and communication efficiency, federated learning has become an appealing research field. The idea of the standard federated learning method FedAvg [4] is to directly conduct the weight average on local parameters of clients, which fails to obtain robust performance and convergence rate with Non-IID data. A number of prior works have attempted to mitigate the deficiency of FedAvg. In [7], the authors leveraged a regularization term to close the divergence between local and global parameters. By applying which, the global information from previous rounds can avoid being forgotten in the local training stage. Instead of using the global parameter to bound the local drift, works [14], [15] and [8] investigated to modify the local gradient by computing a control variable for each client. For example, authors in [15] utilized a dynamic regularizer for each device at each round, which can align the local-level update to the global direction. While this type of method successfully enhances the convergence rate in label distribution shift FL and achieves superior performance than conventional method FedAvg, some studies like [16] and [17] considered to deal with the feature shift in Non-IID data. For instance, based on the utility of batch normalization (BN), Li et al. in [17] developed a novel method that excludes the BN layer in the averaging step, which can theoretically improve the convergence rate and performance robustness with variant client features. Although these works developed efficacious strategies to overcome the issues in Non-IID FL, due to the universal average operation, the target distribution of global model can be divergent to local data distributions. Thus, the resulting global model does not confirm the unbiased performance on different clients.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from above single-model based schemes, other works aim to build personalized models for individual clients while still draw shared knowledge from federation. The idea of pFL was first proposed in [18] with a multi-task learning setting, which applies a task-specific model to each client. Inspired by this design, some works [19], [20] and [21] conducted the clustering approaches to group clients to smaller cliques based on the similarity of their local distributions and learn specialized model for each clique. For instance, Briggs et al. in [20] proposed a hierarchical clustering approach that separates the clients by the similarity of their local modifications to the global model and creates independent model for each cluster. By sharing representations between related clients, the clustering schemes can improve generalization of each model. Mixed model is also a prevalent learning scheme in pFL, several literatures such as [9], [22] and [23] considered to decompose neural network to the global and local parts. As a typical example, Arivazhagan et al. in [9] tried to only aggregate the bottom layers near the input side through federated average and remain the top layer with local updated parameters. The purpose of these studies is to prevent overfitting issue by aggregating the feature extraction capabilities learned by different clients while preserving the knowledge of the local data distributions. Besides above methods, some works [24] and [25] studied to utilize meta-learning-like methods to customize the global trained model to specific client. In [25], Fallah et al. utilized the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework to find an initial global model, which can be easily adapt to clients’ personal datasets by performing a few steps of local training. These methods provide relatively fair concern to every single user and achieved notable results; however, they lack the consideration of different labeling capabilities of individuals, which requires semi-supervised learning techniques to improve the performance of limited labeled datasets.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As an attractive topic in centralized machine learning, semi-supervised learning (SSL) seeks to tackle the label scarcity by leveraging the unlabeled data. As a powerful approach for SSL, consistency regularization gives the intuition that, a robust neural network should generate invariant predictions for the same unlabeled data with semantic-preserving perturbations [26]. Based on this assumption, many related works [27], [28] and [29] proposed to combine this restriction with data augmentation methods. Another common strategy for SSL is the entropy minimization [30], which aims to reduce the prediction entropy of unlabeled data. More recently, pseudo-labeling method [31] proposed to integrate the idea of consistency regularization to entropy minimization. In detail, the authors used two different data augmentation methods to transform the unlabeled data, and supervised the strongly augmented samples with sharpened low-entropy prediction on the weakly augmented samples. Since the semi-supervised learning problem also exists in the FL scenario, some current studies [13], [32] and [33] investigated to construct SSL framework for FL based applications. As an instance, Jeong et al. in [13] presented an inter-client consistency loss and a disjoint learning pattern on labeled and unlabeled data. These works mainly concentrate on the situation that all clients are partially labeled with consistent ratio or the clients are simply categorized to labeled clients or unlabeled clients. However, in general case, clients with different identities may have diverse labeled ratios and heterogeneous data distributions, leading to the requirement of fair performance regard.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In FL, the inter-client data heterogeneity can be mainly divided into two aspects: label distribution variance and image domain variance (which are also called label distribution skew and feature distribution skew). The former is caused by the difference of label distributions on different devices, while the latter represents the feature disparity caused by the different scanners/sensors, geographical locales and personal photography manners, which are potentially heterogeneous. Besides data heterogeneity, the annotation capabilities of participants tend to be heterogeneous in practical scenarios. As in medical applications, professional institutions or clinics possess the expertise to annotate the medical records (such as medical images), leading to mostly labeled or fully labeled datasets, while individual users lack the knowledge or time to label their data, their local datasets can be completely unlabeled. In addition, we further consider the non-professional enterprises which contain limited ratios of labeled data, due to the reason they can classify few easy samples. To be more general, the labeled-to-unlabeled ratio per clients can be arbitrarily different, which is called label heterogeneity.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Personalized federated learning aims to handle the data heterogeneities by learning personalized models which are well-generalized to their private data distributions. However, in semi-supervised scenario, different ratios of labeled data can bias the perception of clients about their local distributions, leading to performance fairness of personalized models.

In this task, personalized methods also show that performance degrades as the heterogeneity increases. The UM-pFSSL obtains comparable performance and even higher accuracy than baseline method FedAvg-SL, although the performance improvement is slightly weaker than the Non-IID methods FixAvg, FixProx and FixBN. The reason behind is that, under the highly heterogeneous setting, the helper selection mechanism can pick out the most related clients that can give most confident prediction about local unlabeled data. On the contrary, in nearly homogeneous context, almost all clients contain the similar distribution, the client with the largest labeled dataset will predominate the helper list of all clients. The potential knowledge aggregation is weakened in this scenario; thus, the performance does not show significant growth.</p>

The comparisons indicate that our proposed methods can achieve more stable training and benefit from the heterogeneity of data. The main reason is the pseudo-label selection approach can collect the most useful information from related helpers. With higher the heterogeneity in distributed datasets, each selected helper can only provide confident predictions to a fraction of unlabeled data, thus the potential knowledge aggregation integrates more helpers and obtain more preferable and robust performance.</p>

As the training rounds increase, UM-pFSSL with EN shows more smooth error decreasing than the one with TA. While the UM-pFSSL with TA presents a rapid dropping in 50-100 rounds and then oscillates around a stable value. The combination of the two shows the same downward trend as EN and has a lower error rate than both. This result clearly tells us that with our designed corresponding metric, the selected helpers are able to annotate unlabeled data effectively.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose UM-pFSSL to address the issues caused by Non-IID data and label scarcity in pFL setting. In detail, a semi-supervised learning paradigm is developed, which allows each client to gather the knowledge from related neighbors to gain confident pseudo labels for local data. Based on this paradigm, we design a new client-relation measurement, which theoretically guarantees the generalization ability improvement of local model. To mitigate the heavy communication cost introduced by model exchange, we further present a helper selection strategy. Extensive experiments on two different datasets confirm that, compared to related works, our proposed method obtains the competitive achievements on performance and convergence rate than other related works, and benefits from data heterogeneity. In the future, we plan to extend this work into unsupervised learning based Non-IID FL scenario.</p>
