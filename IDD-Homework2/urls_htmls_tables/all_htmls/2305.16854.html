<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving distributed training scheme, where multiple devices collaborate to train machine learning models by uploading local model updates. To improve communication efficiency, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been applied to FL, which leverages analog modulation to harness the superposition property of radio waves such that numerous devices can upload their model updates concurrently for aggregation. However, the uplink channel noise incurs considerable model aggregation distortion, which is critically determined by the device scheduling and compromises the learned model performance. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic device scheduling framework for over-the-air FL, named <em id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">PO-FL</em>, to mitigate the negative impact of channel noise, where each device is scheduled according to a certain probability and its model update is reweighted using this probability in aggregation.
We prove the unbiasedness of this aggregation scheme and demonstrate the convergence of PO-FL on both convex and non-convex loss functions.
Our convergence bounds unveil that the device scheduling affects the learning performance through the <em id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">communication distortion</em> and <em id="id2.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global update variance</em>. Based on the convergence analysis, we further develop a channel and gradient-importance aware algorithm to optimize the device scheduling probabilities in PO-FL. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed PO-FL framework with channel and gradient-importance awareness achieves faster convergence and produces better models than baseline methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have experienced significant breakthroughs.
Various AI applications such as smart transportation and virtual reality (VR) generate a massive volume of data on devices at the edge of wireless networks.
These data, in turn, stimulate the development of AI as they can be utilized to train powerful ML models for numerous intelligent applications.
The conventional approach of utilizing these data is to upload them to a central server for centralized model training.
This approach, however, incurs a high communication cost and poses a severe risk of data leakage.
To address these issues, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> was proposed as a privacy-preserving distributed training scheme, where the devices train their models locally based on private data and periodically send their local model updates to the central server. The server aggregates the received model updates to generate a new global model for the next round of training. As there is no need for devices to share local data, FL enables collaborative training while preserving data privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the benefits of FL, it suffers a significant communication bottleneck for model uploading due to limited communication resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Conventional FL systems allocate orthogonal channels to the devices for model uploading, which, however, leads to an explosive bandwidth requirement and fails to support simultaneous transmissions of many devices. To alleviate this bottleneck, over-the-air computation (AirComp) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which leverages the superposition property of radio waves to support the concurrent transmission from multiple devices, has been introduced to FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
By proper pre-equalization and transmit power control at the devices, the server can estimate a linear combination of signals from the devices.
The required bandwidth or communication latency of AirComp is independent of the number of devices and thus significantly relieves the communication bottleneck.
Since the server only requires a weighted sum of local model updates to devise the global model, AirComp suits FL aggregation well, which promotes the emergence of a new area, namely <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">over-the-air FL</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, over-the-air FL is prone to communication distortion during model aggregation due to wireless channel fading and noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The distortion is quantified by the mean square error (MSE) between the received and ground-truth signals. This can mislead the update of the global model and severely degrade the training performance.
To mitigate these drawbacks, various methods have been proposed, such as power control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and transceiver designs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
The power control method with a channel inversion-based structure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is commonly used in over-the-air FL, where power control and denoising factors are co-designed to achieve alignments among devices given individual average transmit power constraints.
An improvement to this design is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> by taking model update statistics into account, which accelerates the convergence speed.
Similarly, Cao <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> maximized the convergence speed by designing a power control policy.
These approaches, however, assume the participation of all the devices including those with poor channel conditions, which leads to performance depression.
In AirComp, devices with better channel conditions must reduce their transmit power to achieve global alignment across all devices. Consequently, devices with weaker channels tend to dominate the overall communication distortion incurred during alignment. This negative effect can be mitigated through carefully scheduling devices based on channel quality to minimize the impact of weak signals.
In this regard, Zhu <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed a truncated channel inversion strategy, where devices with poor channel conditions are excluded from the concurrent transmission.
While being effective in reducing communication distortion, this approach may exclude devices with important model updates that could accelerate training. To maximize the benefits of collaborative FL, device scheduling must take into account both channel quality and the significance of local updates. Simply scheduling devices based on channel conditions alone could leave out local updates that are most informative for improving the global model. Therefore, an optimal scheduling policy for over-the-air FL is needed to not only minimize communication distortion but also optimize learning performance by judiciously selecting devices according to channel quality and the importance of their local model updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recent works have proposed different device scheduling policies for FL to alleviate the distortion of AirComp. For instance, Yang <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a joint device selection and beamforming design for over-the-air FL, which prioritizes devices with better channel quality.
An update importance aware scheduling policy was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> that selects devices with more informative model updates, i.e., those with larger update norms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, for faster convergence in over-the-air FL.
Nevertheless, these policies considered a single aspect for device scheduling, i.e., either the channel condition or update importance, which limits the training performance in extreme cases.
To address this issue, a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> explored a mixed scheduling policy that defines device quality as a weighted sum of its local update norm and channel condition.
Moreover, some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed comprehensive device scheduling designs to balance the training performance and energy cost via Lyapunov optimization.
By considering both update importance and channel conditions in device scheduling, these works significantly improved the training performance of over-the-air FL.
However, they adopted deterministic metrics for device scheduling, which may lead to biased model aggregation in each communication round.
Specifically, the devices in FL have non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and the local training on these data can result in diverged local updates.
Consequently, the global update aggregated from a subset of selected devices may deviate from the expected one from all the devices. <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>We note that even in the IID scenarios, variations exist in data samples observed by the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. However, in this work, our focus is specifically on ensuring the statistical unbiasedness of the model update with respect to the non-IID data distribution among devices.</span></span></span>
The biased update degrades the convergence performance of global training, as it is only guaranteed to converge to a neighbor of the optimum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
These limitations highlight the necessity for novel approaches in device scheduling that can ensure the unbiased aggregation while utilizing only a subset of local updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To ensure unbiased model aggregations in FL, probabilistic device scheduling has been explored in the existing literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
By reweighting the local gradient of each selected device with a scheduling probability, the aggregated gradient provides an unbiased estimate of the global gradient. This approach effectively avoids misleading the update of global model training and improves the learned model accuracy.
Ren <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a probabilistic scheduling framework for FL that admits devices based on an optimized probability distribution, effectively balancing the update importance and per-round communication latency. Based on the convergence analysis, this framework was further developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to minimize the total communication time of an FL process.
Moreover, probabilistic device scheduling was adopted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> to construct an unbiased estimate of the global update computed on all the devices by involving only a subset of fast devices.
However, these scheduling methods mainly focused on reducing the communication latency for conventional FL systems.
In contrast, the communication latency for AirComp is determined by the number of transmitted symbols, which is independent of the device scheduling.
Consequently, these methods are not applicable to over-the-air FL.
In this context, designing a probabilistic device scheduling policy for over-the-air FL poses new challenges.
Specifically, the policy must jointly consider the impact of channel conditions on communication distortion and the importance of local updates uploaded by the devices. Therefore, developing a novel device scheduling policy becomes necessary to enhance the learning performance of over-the-air FL.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate probabilistic scheduling in over-the-air FL.</p>

To avoid significant model aggregation distortion, existing works employ various methods such as power control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and transceiver designs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
These works allow full participation of all clients including the devices with poor channels, which still deteriorates the training performance.
One straightforward method is to only schedule devices with acceptable channel conditions for model aggregation.
However, as will be elaborated in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling ‣ Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling for Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, this scheduling policy may exclude the important updates of those weak devices.
In addition, aggregating the local gradients from only a fraction of devices usually results in a biased estimate of the desired global gradient <math id="S2.SS2.p6.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math"

To achieve unbiased gradient estimates, we propose a probabilistic device scheduling scheme for over-the-air FL named PO-FL.
It is worth noting that existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> on probabilistic device scheduling aim to minimize the communication time in conventional FL with digital communication scheme. However, the communication time is a constant in AirComp due to the concurrent transmission, which makes the designs in these works inapplicable to over-the-air FL. In contrast, the proposed device scheduling scheme focuses on alleviating the model aggregation distortion in over-the-air FL.
In the next section, we describe the PO-FL framework in detail and analyze its convergence performance.</p>

The local objectives of many ML problems, such as those involving convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are non-convex.
For these problems, the learned model may converge to a local minimum or a saddle point.

According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the larger this upper bound is, the more communication rounds are required for convergence. Therefore, we can minimize both factors in order to accelerate the learning convergence.
Based on Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ III-B Convergence Analysis ‣ III The PO-FL Framework ‣ Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling for Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we can further characterize the convergence behavior of PO-FL with non-convex local loss functions in the following corollary.</p>

Specifically, we first calculate the optimal scheduling probabilities for single-device scheduling in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="IV-A Single-Device Scheduling ‣ IV Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling ‣ Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling for Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-A</span></span></a>.
This step serves as an initialization process in the proposed design.
Subsequently, in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Multi-Device Scheduling ‣ IV Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling ‣ Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling for Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a>, we employ a sampling without replacement approach to schedule the remaining devices. This complements the single-device scheduling and completes the overall scheduling process.</p>

Our proposed device scheduling approach takes into account both the channel condition and gradient importance.
By adopting this approach, we ensure that the scheduling probabilities for each device are recomputed to reflect the exclusion of previously scheduled devices.
The proposed method provides closed-form solutions of scheduling probabilities and avoids high-complexity searching.</p>

On one hand, the importance-aware scheduling strategy overlooks the communication quality and may lead to large aggregation distortion.

noise. In contrast, our proposed scheduling approach considers both the gradient importance and communication quality to embrace their respective advantages. Moreover, we assign smaller probabilities to the devices with better channel gains to amplify their transmit signals to be more resistant to channel noise. By doing so, we can maintain the training performance improvement even under large channel noise, as verified by simulation results in the next section.</span></p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To verify the effectiveness of the proposed metrics in (<a href="#S4.E34" title="In IV-A Single-Device Scheduling ‣ IV Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling ‣ Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling for Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">34</span></a>), we present the test accuracy of various device scheduling methods when only one device is scheduled in each communication round in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-B1 Single-Device Scheduling ‣ V-B Results ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling for Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
We observe that the deterministic scheduling method results in poor training performance, particularly when tackling the more challenging CIFAR-10 dataset.
In contrast, the proposed scheduling policy achieves the fastest convergence and performs closely to the idealized noise-free case.
Notably, the importance-aware scheduling method exhibits degraded learning performance due to communication distortion incurred by AirComp.
Interestingly, the PO-FL framework fails to converge when using the channel-aware scheduling method.
This is because assigning lower probabilities to devices with worse channel conditions increases the aggregation weights <math id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\left\{\frac{m_{i}}{Mp_{i}^{t}}\right\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml"><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml">{</mo><mfrac id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">m</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">M</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><msubsup id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.2.cmml">p</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.3.cmml">i</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml">t</mi></msubsup></mrow></mfrac><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><set id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2"><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><divide id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"></divide><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝑚</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑀</ci><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.2">𝑝</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3">𝑡</ci></apply></apply></apply></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\left\{\frac{m_{i}}{Mp_{i}^{t}}\right\}</annotation></semantics></math>, leading to larger communication distortion.

Compared with the single-device case, all scheduling methods show an improvement in test accuracy.
This is because scheduling more devices allows the server to collect a larger number of gradients, thereby accelerating the FL process.
Similar to the single-device case, our proposed scheduling method achieves the fastest convergence. Noticeably, it also attains the same test accuracy as the idealized noise-free case. This is because our optimization of the device scheduling balances the devices with different channel conditions, which avoids significant communication distortion while assuring the importance of received gradients.
Moreover, it is worth noting that the deterministic device scheduling method directly aggregates the received gradients without reweighting, leading to its slower convergence than most probabilistic device scheduling methods.
However, it avoids improper device selection and aggregation weight design in the channel-aware device scheduling method and thus achieves better learned model accuracy.
Since the deterministic scheduling method cannot achieve unbiased aggregation, we exclude it from the following studies and focus on different scheduling policies under the PO-FL framework.</p>

We report the best test accuracy over 100 (respectively 200) communication rounds on the MNIST (respectively CIFAR-10) dataset.
We observe that as the noise power increases, the model performance with different scheduling policies degrades due to more significant communication distortion.
Moreover, the proposed scheduling method outperforms the baseline methods by admitting devices with more important gradient information and better channel quality.
The performance improvement is particularly significant in the noise-limited regime, i.e., <math id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sigma_{z}^{2}=10^{-10}\sim 10^{-9}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><msubsup id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">σ</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.3.cmml">z</mi><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">2</mn></msubsup><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">=</mo><msup id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3.cmml"><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3a" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3.2.cmml">10</mn></mrow></msup><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.5" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.5.cmml">∼</mo><msup id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.2.cmml">10</mn><mrow id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3.cmml"><mo id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3a" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3.2" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3.2.cmml">9</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><and id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1a.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"></and><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1b.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"></eq><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.2">𝜎</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.3">𝑧</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3">2</cn></apply><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.2">10</cn><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3"><minus id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.3.2">10</cn></apply></apply></apply><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1c.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.5">similar-to</csymbol><share href="#S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.4.cmml" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1d.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"></share><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.2">10</cn><apply id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3"><minus id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.6.3.2">9</cn></apply></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1c">\sigma_{z}^{2}=10^{-10}\sim 10^{-9}</annotation></semantics></math>, where the negative effect of communication distortion is more prominent.

This trend can be attributed to the fact that as communication distortion becomes more pronounced, the overall model performance is more severely deteriorated.

For example, consider a scenario where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as edge devices fly in urban environments with tall buildings or natural obstacles, the communication link quality may be severely affected. In this case, it is more favorable to use a large value of <math id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.5.m5.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS6.p1.5.m5.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math> to avoid severe communication distortion.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a novel framework named PO-FL that leverages probabilistic device scheduling to enhance the learning performance of over-the-air FL.
We analyzed the convergence of PO-FL for both convex and non-convex loss functions. Our analysis revealed that the device scheduling policy critically affects the learning performance through the communication distortion and the global update variance.
Based on the analytical results, we formulated an optimization problem of device scheduling to jointly minimize these two factors, which was efficiently solved by an algorithm that considers both channel condition and gradient importance.
Extensive simulation results demonstrated that the proposed design outperforms baseline policies and consistently achieves faster convergence.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For future works, it is worth investigating how to optimize the number of scheduled devices in each communication round to further improve the training performance of the PO-FL framework.
Besides, it is also interesting to study the impact of the number of local training steps on the communication efficiency in the PO-FL framework.
Moreover, considering the benefits of AI/ML-enabled methods in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, it is very promising to explore these methods in the device scheduling designs for over-the-air FL.</p>
