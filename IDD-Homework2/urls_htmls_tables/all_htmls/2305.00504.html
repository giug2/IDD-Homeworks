<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient federated learning (FL) framework for the energy-constrained devices over cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN), where each device adopts quantized neural networks (QNNs) to train a local FL model and transmits the quantized model parameter to the remote radio heads (RRHs). Each RRH receives the signals from devices over the wireless link and forwards the signals to the CS via the fronthaul link. We rigorously develop an energy consumption model for the local training at devices through the use of QNNs and communication models over Cloud-RAN. Based on the proposed energy consumption model, we formulate an energy minimization problem that optimizes the fronthaul rate allocation, user transmit power allocation, and QNN precision levels while satisfying the limited fronthaul capacity constraint and ensuring the convergence of the proposed FL model to a target accuracy.
To solve this problem, we analyze the convergence rate and propose efficient algorithms based on the alternative optimization technique. Simulation results show that the proposed FL framework can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to other conventional approaches. We draw the conclusion that the proposed framework holds great potential for achieving a sustainable and environmentally-friendly FL in Cloud-RAN.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables wireless devices to cooperatively train a centralized model on a central CS (CS) while utilizing their respective local datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
The most popular approach in FL involves the learning of a global model collaboratively through iterating the following three steps: (i) the CS broadcasts the global model to the participated wireless devices; (ii) each device utilizes its local dataset to update its local model and then transmits its model updates to the CS; (iii) the CS aggregates the model updates sent by the devices, and updates the global model parameters for the next iteration of FL. FL based on the aforementioned learning steps preserves the privacy of the wireless devices, since the CS lacks direct access to their local datasets. Thanks to this unique feature, FL is rendered as an ideal learning framework in various practical applications.
It has garnered widespread attention for its potential to facilitate the development of privacy-sensitive artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The primary challenges of enabling FL within wireless networks pertain to the scarcity of radio resources and the substantial energy expenditure required for deploying FL over resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. These issues are further exacerbated in cloud-edge AI systems, where radio resources and device energy consumption are restricted, and the model updates from individual wireless devices during each round of training become more intricate, potentially encompassing millions to billions of parameters. The total energy consumed in FL over wireless networks depends on the energy consumption during the local training process and communication. Therefore, improving the energy efficiency of FL through wireless networks is of utmost importance to facilitate the practical implementation of environmentally sustainable FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the problem, various model compression approaches such as sparsification and quantization have been explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, an one-bit compressive sensing scheme was designed for over-the-air FL to reduce the volume of the transmitted data. Meanwhile, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> exploited the observations of the intrinsic temporal sparsity of local updates in FL and characterized the property using a Markovian probability model. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, a transmission strategy over massive MIMO communication system via random permutation was developed, while the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> adopted block sparsification to reduce the computation complexity of gradient reconstruction. The count-sketch data structure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> was also used in sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> for FL to tackle the problem of sparse client participation.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from the aforementioned studies that primarily focus on model compression techniques, various works have recently been introduced, focusing on system-level optimization to enhance the energy efficiency of FL
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> studied the balance between energy consumption and carbon footprints in FL with low-power embedded wireless devices. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the authors formulated and solved two optimization problems concerning the overall learning performance and the energy consumption.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> aimed to minimize the total energy consumption subject to a latency constraint while designing parameters including time allocation, bandwidth, power, computation frequency, and learning accuracy. A transmission scheme was designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to minimize the total energy consumption under a quality-of-service constraint over massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> leveraged sparse neural networks (SNN) to further reduce the computation complexity in local training and formulated an energy minimization problem concerning computing, uploading and broadcasting. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors utilized a game tree to model the FL training process to achieve a desired balance between the model performance, privacy preservation and energy consumption. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a resource optimization under a training workload constraint to balance the tradeoff between the energy consumption and model performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the authors focused on balancing the tradeoff between energy efficiency and convergence rate while controlling the optimal precision level. Furthermore, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> investigated a joint minimization problem whose goal is to minimize the energy consumption with respect to the precision level in both local training and uplink transmission, the number of communication rounds, the number of local training rounds, and the number of participated devices in each communication round. However, the works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> did not consider FL in cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN), in which remote radio heads (RRHs) are deployed to capture signals from devices and to forward them to the CS through high-speed, reliable fronthual links <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. The orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based Cloud-RAN has been shown to significantly improve system scalability, throughput, and coverage thanks to its spectral efficiency and low encoding/decoding complexity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In addition, OFDMA-based Cloud-RAN is also suitable for the latest wireless devices equipped with digital modulation chips <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
All the aforementioned works either focus on improving energy efficiency over wireless networks or focus on system optimization in Cloud-RAN without considering FL.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work that jointly considers the tradeoff between the model performance and energy efficiency while controlling the precision level, wireless power control, and fronthaul rate allocation design in an OFDMA-based Cloud-RAN system.
In this paper, we aim to address the research gap by designing an energy-efficient FL framework in OFDMA-based Cloud-RAN. Our proposed framework aims to reduce energy consumption during the entire training process over Cloud-RAN.

In this context, we adopt a uniform scalar quantization method which is commonly used in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. We use this method at each RRH to obtain the sum-rate.

<p id="S5.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the aforementioned simulations, we conclude that our proposed framework requires much less energy than a standard FL model. We discover the tradeoff exists between the energy consumption and the convergence accuracy with respect to user transmit power, fronthaul rate, as well as the precision level. In particular, a very small level of precision may induce an undesired quantization error leading to much more rounds of iterations, while a very large energy level of precision may also bring extra energy consumption. The proposed framework demonstrates significant performance benefits thanks to the joint design of the precision level, the fronthaul rate, and user transmit power.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work presented an effective and practical way to implement FL on energy-constrained devices, by introducing QNNs to simplify the computation complexity, as well as OFDMA-based Cloud-RAN to improve the communication performance. To this end, a rigorous energy consumption model for computing energy consumption of QNNs and communication energy consumption over Cloud-RAN was introduced. Based on the rigorous convergence analysis, we then formulated and solved an energy minimization problem to jointly optimize the power allocation, fronthaul rate allocation, and precision levels of QNNs subject to a target accuracy and limited fronthaul link capacity. Simulation results have shown that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the energy consumption while balancing the tradeoff between energy efficiency and convergence rate.</p>
