<p id="1.1" class="ltx_p">Horizontal federated learning (HFL) enables distributed clients to train a shared model and keep their data privacy. In training high-quality HFL models, the data heterogeneity among clients is one of the major concerns. However, due to the security issue and the complexity of deep learning models, it is challenging to investigate data heterogeneity across different clients. To address this issue, based on a requirement analysis we developed a visual analytics tool, HetVis, for participating clients to explore data heterogeneity. We identify data heterogeneity through comparing prediction behaviors of the global federated model and the stand-alone model trained with local data. Then, a context-aware clustering of the inconsistent records is done, to provide a summary of data heterogeneity. Combining with the proposed comparison techniques, we develop a novel set of visualizations to identify heterogeneity issues in HFL. We designed three case studies to introduce how HetVis can assist client analysts in understanding different types of heterogeneity issues. Expert reviews and a comparative study demonstrate the effectiveness of HetVis.</p>

Introduction</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the big data era, data is often distributed among many isolated data owners. It is an urgent and challenging need for the data owners to benefit from data integration, e.g., to train high-quality models, while also respecting privacy concerns. To satisfy this requirement, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> (FL) keeps data locally in clients when training a shared model. Only encrypted parameters are shared with other clients. Especially, horizontal federated learning (HFL), which integrates data from the same feature space but distributed at different clients, has been widely used in privacy-aware applications, like healthcare and mobile service <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p4.1" class="ltx_p">A key and common challenge of HFL is the <em id="p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">heterogeneity</em> of data distribution. The efficiency of current HFL techniques depends on the assumption that data distribution in different clients is independent and identically distributed (IID). However, the IID assumption usually does not hold. Non-IID data is widely used in model training to increase sample size and leads to difficulties in convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Figuring out their existence is necessary for applications of HFL. Specifically, data heterogeneity can exert both negative impacts and positive impacts on the accuracy of trained models. <span id="p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Statistical heterogeneity</span>, meaning that distributed data cover the same classes but different proportions, can be positive. For example, one client has insufficient samples in one class while the other clients have adequate samples in the same class. In this case, multiple clients are facilitated in the collaboration. <span id="p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Label heterogeneity</span> means that similar instances are labeled differently in different clients. The divergence in label settings usually affects model training negatively. Therefore, it is critical for participating clients to diagnose the data heterogeneity in the training process and fine-tune the model and data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. We identify two analysis goals in heterogeneity: (1) detecting the existence of data heterogeneity and (2) knowing the impacts of data heterogeneity. For example, hospitals collect patient data for disease analysis, and search engines record user logs for advertising recommendations.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, analyzing the data heterogeneity in HFL is highly challenging. Traditional approaches identify heterogeneity through comparing data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Due to the privacy issue, a client is prevented from accessing data owned by other clients directly. Direct comparison between local data and global data is infeasible.
The HFL model is the only intelligence fed back to the client by the cooperation.
As it is trained with the global model with a HFL framework, the global data is learned by the HFL model.
There are two challenges in analyzing data heterogeneity based on the HFL model.
First, although a lot of works have been dedicated to understanding deep learning models by input and output data, the inverse workflow of understanding the unavailable training data by the model is still an open problem.
Second, the behavior of the HFL model depends on multiple factors, including the data and model architectures. How to distinguish the effect of training data from other factors is also challenging.
An encompassing analysis workflow is still missing for HFL analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p6.1" class="ltx_p">To fill the above research gap, we present a visual analytics tool for client analysts to detect and understand data heterogeneity in HFL under the privacy limitation. We leverage a contrastive analysis approach to locate heterogeneous records and examine them. To overcome the privacy limitation, we propose to train a stand-alone model based on local data and compare it with the HFL model. Because data is learned by a model in the training process, the comparison between the two models discloses the heterogeneity between the local data and global data. We further propose a cluster analysis method based on rank-based distance measurement to distinguish the impacts from different group of heterogeneous records. We developed an interactive interface, called <span id="p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HetVis</span>, in conjunction with our analysis approach to monitor, explore, and understand the models and instances. A comparative study is implemented to show that the proposed cluster analysis method is more helpful for analyzing heterogeneity than hierarchical clustering. Three case studies were designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our interface when analyzing different kinds of data heterogeneity. We also collected informative reviews from three experts in FL, confirming the effectiveness of <span id="p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HetVis</span>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the first scenario, heterogeneity issues, including state heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, hardware heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, statistical heterogeneity, and label heterogeneity, lead to convergence problems of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In this paper, we focus on identifying data heterogeneity issues (i.e., statistical heterogeneity and label heterogeneity). Related studies leverage automatic solutions to improve model robustness. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> modifies the weight updating algorithm to limit the impact of local updates on the global model. This approach, however, can hardly address the label heterogeneity problem, because the trained model can be meaningless if the definition of labels varies for different clients. Another solution is to train separated models instead of a global one. Separated models can learn from each other based on state-of-the-art frameworks, such as meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. However, these automatic solutions lack the ability to analyze heterogeneity and therefore miss the chance to optimize models by means, like managing distributed data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the second scenario, meta-analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> is proposed as a methodology to discriminate, combine and summarize multiple statistical analysis results. In the discrimination stage, statistical tests are leveraged to assess the significance of heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. If the heterogeneity is significant, the statistical analysis results cannot be integrated directly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. A feasible solution is to locate and exclude the variables or moderators that result in the heterogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. However, these approaches are not practical for FL due to the privacy limitation.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">

DeepEyes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> allows users to check details of detected stable layers in deep neural networks through three linked views, which depict activations, instances, and filters to judge if a layer is oversized or unnecessary. GANViz <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> compares image features from the dimension of time.

At the beginning of the training, the model settings are unified for initialization. After that, cooperated training performs iteratively. Each communication round includes four steps. First, each client receives centralized parameters from the server. Second, each client updates the parameter by training and testing with local data. Then, each local update is submitted to the server. For privacy concerns, parameters can be encrypted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> or processed by differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Because clients cannot exchange the raw data, the primary issue of designing a visual diagnosis tool for data heterogeneity is that a direct comparison among data from different clients is infeasible. We interviewed two FL experts (E1 and E2) to define requirements. Both of them are senior machine learning researchers who have studied FL for more than 3 years and published related papers. They said that they have no effective solutions to deal with heterogeneity issues caused by heterogeneous data. Although a visualization system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> is proposed to inspect the training process of the HFL, a tool for heterogeneity exploration is still missing. Without the understanding of data heterogeneity, it is challenging to remove heterogeneity issues thoroughly. Therefore, the experts agree that an interactive visualization tool to examine the data heterogeneity is critical for real applications.</p>

Because model parameters updated in a single communication round could be affected by accident outliers, it is necessary to provide an overview of parameter updates during the entire training process. In each communication round, model parameters can be considered as a high-dimensional vector. To observe parameters from a low-dimensional perspective, we generate a 2D projection for the parameter vectors of the HFL model in all communication rounds. To reflect parameter exchanges, parameters submitted by the local client are transformed into vectors of the same size and projected onto the same plane. The employed projection approach is accelerated by a probabilistic algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Considering that different parameters contribute in different ways, we allow users to specify a group of parameters and check them individually. For example, users can specify a layer in the neural network and check the projection of the model parameters on this layer.</p>

Users need to extract heterogeneity issues by identifying commons shared by inconsistent records but not shared by others. However, it is exhausting to inspect each dimension, considering the records are high dimensional. To improve analysis efficiency, we provide users with two entrances for dimension selections. The first entrance navigates users from the perspective of data space. This entrance shows how important each dimension is to distinguish the selected cluster from others based on the first two cPCs of ccPCA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The second entrance navigates users from the perspective of model behaviors, which only works for HFL based on CNN models. Gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> can measure how important each dimension is for a CNN model to classify a record. The average Grad-CAM of all records in the cluster can identify significant dimensions to a model. To analyze inconsistent model behaviors, we generate a pair of average Grad-CAMs for the stand-alone training model and the HFL model, respectively. Comparing the two average Grad-CAMs can help users identify the differences in model judgments. However, such differences in model judgment can hardly be demonstrated by Grad-CAMs in rare cases (e.g., models with cascading randomization) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.

When the entrance based on ccPCA is activated, two pixel maps represent the quantified importance of each dimension measured by the first two cPCs, respectively. When the entrance based on Grad-CAM is used, the two pixel maps represent the quantified importance evaluated by the two models, respectively. In a pixel map, each pixel corresponds to a dimension. If records are in the form of pictures, the relative position of a pixel is consistent with its position in pictures. If the pictures have more than one channel (e.g., RGB channels), users can select a channel and check a channel at a time. The color of a pixel encodes the dimension importance.</p>

The horizontal position is specified by the ground-truth label, and the vertical position is specified by the output from the HFL model. The records in the non-diagonal cells indicate that the HFL model generates incorrect output. If extra labels (i.e., the labels not included in the ground-truth labels) exist in the output of the HFL model, there will be extra rows listed after the labels included in the ground-truth label.

As shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 6.1 Handwritten Digits Recognition ‣ 6 Case Studies ‣ HetVis: A Visual Analysis Approach for Identifying Data Heterogeneity in Horizontal Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, certain dimensions are distributed in corners of the pictures. Verified by several records, we found that they were digit-1s in typography font (<span id="S6.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">R3.2</span>). The HFL model is inclined to
misidentify this rare handwritten style as other digit labels, like digit-7.</p>

To compare high-level features extracted by CNN models, we selected the last two convolutional layers, respectively.

Three clusters with extra-low federated accuracy and a relatively large size caught our attention.
All of the records in these clusters are misclassified as with no mask by the HFL model. We then checked these records by clicking the highlighted circles in the label exploration view.

There are 36 inconsistent records in the non-diagonal cells (misclassified by the HFL model) and 157 ones in the diagonal cells (misclassified by the stand-alone training model). Therefore, the HFL model is superior to the stand-alone training model in the task of distinguishing local labels. In summary, we could benefit from the HFL cooperation.

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We interviewed three researchers (E3, E4, and E5) who had worked on FL for two years. For each interview, we first introduced our approach and then presented a demo of our system. After that, experts were allowed to freely explore data heterogeneity of the above three cases in our system. At the end of the interview, we collected their feedback on the following four aspects. Each interview lasted about an hour.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Effectiveness.</span> Due to data isolation, existing approaches to heterogeneity analysis are mainly by observing local data and identifying skewed distributions. All experts agreed that our system could help them better to formulate reasonable hypotheses of heterogeneity than their original approaches. E3 said that the heterogeneity issues could be solved by adjusting records in the local client (e.g., expanding records) and findings in our system indicated which kind of adjustments could improve the performance of the HFL. E5 also noted that cluster analysis could efficiently locate heterogeneous issues and guide batch corrections.</p>

Both E3 and E4 appreciated the annotation functionality and commented that annotation allowed them to track certain sets of records. For visual designs, E3 and E5 were impressed by the intuitive representations in the parameter projection view. E3 commented that “It can clearly reflect the conflicts between local updates and the HFL parameters.” Particularly, a disagreement occurred with the dimension exploration. E4 was inclined to navigate by ccPCA because it could summarize data characteristics. However, E5 preferred the model-driven Grad-CAM to understand model behaviors.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Findings.</span>
When the accuracy of either model was satisfying, E4 found that the inconsistent records could depict the boundary of two classes in the ccPCA projection. Based on this observation, E4 drew the conclusion that the HFL model and the stand-alone training model would fail to reach an agreement especially when the target records were hard to classify, i.e., the records were distributed along the classification boundary. E4 also found that ccPCA separated inconsistent records from the consistent context, which in the meantime split different classes (see Figures <span class="ltx_ref ltx_ref_self"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title">HetVis: A Visual Analysis Approach for Identifying<span class="ltx_text"> </span>Data Heterogeneity in Horizontal Federated Learning</span></span>(b1) and <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 6.2 Face Mask Recognition ‣ 6 Case Studies ‣ HetVis: A Visual Analysis Approach for Identifying Data Heterogeneity in Horizontal Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>).

Despite the effectiveness and usefulness of our system, the experts offered two suggestions. First, we should take into account the architecture of the neural network when analyzing parameter exchanges (E3, E5). For example, users might focus on parameters in certain layers in the neural network when evaluating a deep learning model. Therefore, we improved the parameter projection view by grouping parameters based on layers. Users are allowed to select a layer and check parameters in the corresponding layer. Second, considering that dozens of labels might be yielded from the HFL model, E3 pointed out that the label exploration view needed an overview to facilitate object location. We plan to add it in the future version of our system.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose <span id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">HetVis</span>, a visual analysis approach to assist identification and examination of data heterogeneity under the privacy limit of HFL. Instead of directly comparing local data and global data, we compare the output of the HFL model with a stand-alone training model.
A contrastive clustering analysis approach is leveraged to extract heterogeneity issues from the inconsistent records identified from the output comparison. In the future, we would like to extend our system to support online tuning of HFL model.
