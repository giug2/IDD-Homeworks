<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Open banking enables individual customers to own their banking data, which provides fundamental support for the boosting of a new ecosystem of data marketplaces and financial services. In the near future, it is foreseeable to have decentralized data ownership in the finance sector using federated learning. This is a just-in-time technology that can learn intelligent models in a decentralized training manner. The most attractive aspect of federated learning is its ability to decompose model training into a centralized server and distributed nodes without collecting private data. This kind of decomposed learning framework has great potential to protect users’ privacy and sensitive data. Therefore, federated learning combines naturally with an open banking data marketplaces. This chapter will discuss the possible challenges for applying federated learning in the context of open banking, and the corresponding solutions have been explored as well.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a subspecies to the open innovation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> concept, open banking is an emerging trend in turning banks into financial service platforms, namely banking as a service. From a financial technology perspective, open banking refers to:<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> 1) the use of open application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable third-party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution, 2) greater financial transparency options for account holders ranging from open data to private data, and 3) the use of open-source technology to achieve the above.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> Open banking can be naturally evolved into a new ecosystem of data marketplaces where participants can buy and sell data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As stated by McKinsey &amp; Company <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, open banking could bring benefits to banks in various ways, including better customer experience, increased revenue streams, and a sustainable service model for under-served markets. Open banking will form a new ecosystem for financial services by sharing banking data across organizations and providing new services. However, there are inherent risks in sharing banking data, which is sensitive, privacy-concerned, and valuable. It is critical to developing processes and governance underpinning the technical connections. Moreover, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> enforces organizations to pay great attention when sharing and using customers’ data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the new financial ecosystem, a number of small and medium-sized enterprises will provide novel applications using artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Intelligent applications are already driving a dramatic shift in how financial institutions attract and retain active customers. In recent times AI has become widely applied to review small loan applications fast and automatically. In this AI wave, the machine learning (ML) model with a deep neural network architecture has been a huge success in many financial applications. Imagine the open banking scenario in the near future, with a vast amount of customer data derived from various financial service providers that can be integrated and utilized to train a comprehensive AI model superior to all existing models. Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized ML framework that is able to collaboratively train an AI model while preserving user privacy. It is naturally suited to distributed data ownership settings in an open banking scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of open banking, federated learning needs to be adapted and enhanced to solve a few practical challenges, such as broad heterogeneity across users, limited times to access personal data, narrow scope of one user, and managing incentives for data contributors. In the following sections, we will briefly introduce applications of open banking, and then discuss the practical challenges with corresponding techniques that present solutions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">is “a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organization’s business model” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The flows of knowledge may involve various ways to leverage internal and external resources and knowledge. Open banking is a kind of open innovation in the banking industry. By leveraging both internal and external knowledge, many innovative applications will emerge to benefit the whole finance industry, including both banks and third-party companies.</p>

The potential benefits of open banking are substantial including customer experience, revenue, and new service models. It will also improve the finance industry by including more small and medium-sized players with innovative ideas and fine-grained service for different segmentations of customers. In addition to well-known players like Mint, examples include alternative underwriters ranging from Lending Club in the United States to M-Shwari in Africa to Lenddo in the Philippines, and payments disruptors like Stripe and Braintree.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Competition and Markets Authority issued a ruling in August 2016 that required the UK’s nine biggest UK retail banks at that time – HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Danske Bank, Lloyds, and Nationwide – to allow licensed startups direct access to their data down to the level of account-based transactions. By August 2020 there were 240 providers regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority enrolled in open banking. They include many providers of financial apps that help manage finances as well as consumer credit firms that use open banking to access account information for affordability checks and verification.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In February 2020 payments organization Nacha announced a rollout of an online platform, namely Phixius, that integrates technology, rules, and participants to exchange payment-related information across ecosystem participants. It is associated with the current reliance on proprietary bilateral data-sharing agreements, which limits broader efficiency. The platform is intended to enable companies to exchange payment-related information to improve fraud protection, automate manual processes, and improve customer experiences.
Moreover, digital payments company Payrailz announced a partnership with a credit union and FinTech collaborator, namely Constellation Digital Partners, to develop an elevated joint payment solution for credit union clients.</p>

These participants can access Starling Bank account data via an API, and it enables the financial institution to connect businesses with integrated solutions. Moreover, in February 2020 the Commonwealth Bank of Australia launched a free app that enables small businesses to consolidate data from various platforms, such as Xero and Google Analytics. This solution, Vonto, is designed to offer transparent and quick insights, connecting small business owners with 10 “key insights” each morning, including cash flow, social media engagement, and website traffic. The UK’s Simply Asset Finance collaborates with open banking platform AccountScore, to enable Simply to wield an API to unlock borrower data for deeper underwriting capabilities. The companies said they will use the rich data set to assist lending decisions.</p>

The model coordinator and user/participant exchange model parameters that can avoid sending user data. However, the exchanging of model parameters, or gradients in machine learning terminology, may cause data leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Therefore, differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> technology is essential for federated learning to protect privacy from gradient-based cyber-attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

Customers are more likely to not sell the data, but to use the data to train a model in the local device. Moreover, as required by the GDPR, the shared data for a particular financial service, e.g. credit card application, cannot be used for another purpose, e.g. model training. It is therefore a natural solution to integrate federated learning with an open banking data marketplaces.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One challenge of federated learning is statistical heterogeneity in which users have different data distribution. Statistical heterogeneity is an inherent characteristic of a user’s behaviour. It is also identified as a non-IID problem. Conventional machine learning is built upon the IID assumption of a uniform dataset. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization used in vanilla federated learning is not specifically designed and optimized for tackling non-IID data. As described in Fig. <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4 Statistical heterogeneity in federated learning ‣ Federated Learning for Open Banking" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, each participant’s data are generated from different distributions. Each local model should then be initialized by the global model that represents a particular distribution.</p>

The variance of any distribution across participants will cause inconsistency in learning that will eventually damage the performance of a federated learning task. To solve this challenge, the simplest solution is to enhance existing distributed machine learning to be more robust for tolerating heterogeneity across data nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, or to re-weight the contribution of each node according to the similarity of global and local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. However, that solution still uses one global model to service all variety of participants. A better solution is to increase the number of global models from one to multiple (Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Clustered federated learning ‣ 4 Statistical heterogeneity in federated learning ‣ Federated Learning for Open Banking" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>). We can cluster or group the participants so that same-group participants with the same or similar distributions will contribute one of the global models, and each group will have a unique global model. Personalized federated learning (Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Personalized modelling ‣ 4 Statistical heterogeneity in federated learning ‣ Federated Learning for Open Banking" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>) is a recent method that tries to increase the number of global models to be equivalent to the number of participants, and then each participant will have a unique model including both a commonly shared part and personalized information.</p>

In general, two models with similar parameters or functions are more likely to produce a similar outcome regarding the same input. Therefore, measuring models’ similarity is an indirect way to measure distribution. Below are the related methods for clustered federated learning.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When a service provider wants to provide a service that is the best for each individual customer, the model trained in the central server needs to be personalized or customized. The simplest solution is to treat the global model as a pre-trained model, and then use local data to fine-tune the global model, which will derive a personalized model. However, in most cases, each participant just has a limited number of instances, and the fine-tuning operation will cause over-fitting or increase the generalization error. Another solution is to treat each customer as a target task and the pre-trained global model as a source task, then to apply transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> or domain adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> methods to fine-tune each personalized model. These methods will further leverage the global information to improve the fine-tuning process for each participant. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> discusses two approaches, namely Data Interpolation and Model Interpolation, to learn a personalized federated learning model by weighting two components between local and global servers in terms of data distributions or models respectively.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In general, a model can be decomposed into two parts: a representation learning part and a decisive part. For example, CNN is composed of convolution layers for representation extraction and fully-connected layers for classification decision. In a federated learning setting, heterogeneity could impact one of the two parts. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposes to share representation layers across participants, and then keep decision layers as a personalized part. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> thinks representation layers should be the personalized part, and then the decision layers could be shared across participants.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px2.p1.7" class="ltx_p">If we cannot clearly identify which parts in the model will be impacted by the heterogeneity, we can roughly mix the global model and local models to incorporate both common knowledge and personalized knowledge. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposes a mixture model of global and local models in a federated setting. The local model can preserve the personalized information and the global model provides common information. In particular, the loss is designed as below.</p>

A local model is trained in a transfer learning framework by leveraging both public and private datasets. Then, a decentralized knowledge distillation will be applied to exchange information between participants and the coordinator. In particular, each participant calculates the prediction probability for all instances in the public dataset, and then sends it to the coordinator for prediction averaging. The averaged prediction probability could be viewed as the output of a teacher model (teacher) that is an ensemble learning of many local models, and the teacher model’s outputs will be sent back to each participant to train a student model in a knowledge distillation process. In this work, the heterogeneous local models exchange prediction probability acquired on the public dataset, and knowledge distillation allows exchanging information in a model agnostic way.</p>

The distillation mechanism also potentially adds privacy guarantees by replacing some sensitive model parameters during the distillation process. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a new federated distillation (FD) is proposed to improve communication efficiency for an on-device machine learning framework. The proposed FD exchanges the model output rather than the model parameters, which allows the on-device ML to adopt large local models. Prior to operating FD, the non-IID datasets are rectified via federated augmentation, where a generative adversarial network is used for data augmentation under the trade-off between privacy leakage and communication overhead.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In an open banking data marketplaces, the use of participants’ data may be charged by times. For example, in a federated learning process, if the coordinator asks the participant to train the local model three times, they should be charged by three times as well. Moreover, the participant’s data is a dynamically changing profile including its banking-related activities. To capture the dynamic changes of the customers, the federated learning may take an incremental or lifelong learning strategy to regularly use a participant’s data to refine the global model. This will bring a new challenge for continuously sharing data in a long-term model training framework.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The pay-per-access mechanism can also be modeled as a few-shot federated learning problem in which the server can take very few communication rounds with each participant. Regardless of whether the federated learning is horizontal or vertical, the participants can help the coordinator to train a local model according to the global model’s parameters at a particular moment. Thus, the coordinator will pursue highly efficient communication with participants using their data.</p>

The proposed approach utilizes ensemble learning and knowledge aggregation to effectively and efficiently leverage information in large networks with thousands of devices. With this technique, the financial service provider can access the data from multiple data holders and finish model training in only one round of communication. This greatly improves the efficiency of communication and reduces the risk of sensitive data leakage.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The one-class challenge is also a problem. For example, in a fraud detection or break contract, one user’s data can only be labeled as fraud or not-fraud. Most users are labeled as the not-fraud class, which means that there are only a small number of users with the fraud class. Although each user can design and train personalized model based on its own financial data, the model may not be accurate enough as a result of the one-class problem.

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In open banking scenarios, solutions to the one-class problem can fall into two categories. One is to embed the specific one-class classification algorithm into the imbalanced federated financial system from a task-level perspective. The other is to adjust the weights and incentive mechanism among users from a system-level perspective.
One-class classification is also known as anomaly detection in fraud detection applications, where outliers or anomalies are rare examples that do not fit in with the rest of the data.</p>

Based on a stacked auto-encoder, FPCC allows each user to perform training on its local data using hybrid filtering. In open banking, the users’ similarity in a financial perspective can be calculated using the features generated from a stacked auto-encoder. In this way, it is easier to make fraud detection with imbalanced data distribution.</p>

Moreover, malicious behaviour can increase time-to-detection of the attacks. To solve these above issues, they designed a permitted blockchain-based federated learning method where the updates for the auto-encoder model are chained together on the distributed ledger. The trained auto-encoder can recognize the test samples of the baseline class while marking the other test samples that do not fit into the trained model as a potential negative class.</p>
