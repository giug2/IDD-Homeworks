<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated learning (FL) has received intensive research because of its ability in preserving data privacy for scattered clients to collaboratively train machine learning models. Commonly, a parameter server (PS) is deployed for aggregating model parameters contributed by different clients. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is upgraded from FL which allows clients to aggregate model parameters with their neighbours directly. DFL is particularly feasible for vehicular networks as vehicles communicate with each other in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) manner. However, due to the restrictions of vehicle routes and communication distances, it is hard for individual vehicles to sufficiently exchange models with others. Data sources contributing to models on individual vehicles may not diversified enough resulting in poor model accuracy. To address this problem, we propose the DFL-DDS (DFL with diversified Data Sources) algorithm to diversify data sources in DFL. Specifically, each vehicle maintains a state vector to record the contribution weight of each data source to its model.
The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted to measure the diversity of a state vector.
To boost the convergence of DFL, a vehicle tunes the aggregation weight of each data source by minimizing the KL divergence of its state vector, and its effectiveness in diversifying data sources can be theoretically proved.
Finally, the superiority of DFL-DDS is evaluated by extensive experiments (with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets) which demonstrate that DFL-DDS can accelerate the convergence of DFL and improve the model accuracy significantly compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the proliferation of intelligent vehicles, vehicles have accumulated abundant datasets via equipped LiDAR, RIDAR, camera and sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Advanced machine learning models can be obtained by exploiting datasets on vehicles to improve road safety, object recognition accuracy, etc <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
However, exploiting datasets on vehicles for model training confronts at least two challenges: First, accessing raw datasets residing on vehicles inevitably invades data privacy because these datasets probably contain sensitive and confidential information; Second, the communication cost may be very heavy by extensively collecting raw datasets from vehicles. Thanks to the recent advances of federated learning (FL), these challenges can be potentially solved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the rising concerns on data privacy leakage, FL conducts model training without touching original data samples stored on scattered clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In each round of FL global iteration (a.k.a epoch), a parameter server (PS) is responsible for aggregating model parameters collected from participating clients who conduct local iterations with local datasets and then disclose their model parameters to the PS. Global iterations will be conducted for multiple times by involving different clients until the trained model finally converges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To avoid the single point failure and alleviate the communication bottleneck of the PS in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, decentralized FL (DFL) is devised which allows each client to aggregate model parameters gathered from its neighbours directly. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, clients weigh models from neighbours based on their connection degrees or sample sizes for model aggregation. The convergence of DFL has been proved in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> assuming that the network topology formed by clients is connected. DFL is particularly feasible for vehicular networks provided that vehicles as learning clients communicate with each other in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the feasibility of DFL, it is highly possible that individual vehicles <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>We use vehicles exchangeably with clients in our paper. </span></span></span> fail to attain satisfactory model accuracy due to restrictions of their routes and communication distances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. To illustrate this point, we show a concrete example in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Boost Decentralized Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks by Diversifying Data Sources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> by using real traces extracted from DiDi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.

The route of vehicle A has no overlap with the route of vehicle B though their information can be exchanged via intermediate vehicle C. In other words, data sources contributing to model aggregation on vehicle A are not sufficiently diversified given that vehicle A cannot directly communicate with vehicle B. The problem is even worse in a real large-scale vehicular network when vehicles need to exchange model parameters via multiple hops through intermediate vehicles. As a consequence, the convergence of DFL in vehicular networks could be very slow.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Diversifying data sources in FL has been explored by existing works. It has been regarded as an important data related factor affecting model performance in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which proposed a diversity-driven client selection strategy. However, a central server is needed to collect the noisy data sketch of each client to compute the data similarity between two clients. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a joint sampling and data offloading algorithm is proposed to improve model performance, where the sampling method is based on the utility of device data distributions. A D2D (device-to-device) offloading scheme is used to diversify sampled devices, though D2D offloading between neighboring devices is unsuitable in many privacy-preserving tasks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, training workers are assumed to be connected with all data sources, which can ensure that the dataset collected by each training worker is of large diversity.
Unfortunately, these methods cannot be leveraged to support DFL in vehicular networks in that they failed to consider the fully decentralized V2V communication manner in vehicular networks.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To boost DFL by diversifying data sources in vehicular networks, we propose the DFL with diversified data sources (DFL-DDS) algorithm. First of all, we implement the distributed learning algorithm designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> without considering data source diversity to conduct a simulation study. Our study unveils that unlucky vehicles will encounter difficulties to diversify their data sources for model aggregation. Consequently,
their model accuracy is much lower than that of other vehicles.
Inspired by our simulation study, we design DFL-DDS as below. Each vehicle in DFL-DDS maintains a state vector to record the contribution weight of each vehicle in the system to its model, which will be exchanged between vehicles along with the exchange of model parameters.
Formally, we employ the KL divergence to measure the diversity of a state vector, which not only quantifies data source diversity but also accommodates heterogeneous dataset sizes from different vehicles. Prior to aggregating models, each vehicle generates the aggregation weight for each data source by minimizing the KL divergence of its aggregated state vector, and its effectiveness in diversifying data sources can be theoretically illustrated. To validate that higher model accuracy can be attained with more diversified data sources, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our algorithm by using standard MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superb performance achieved by DFL-DDS in comparison with competitive baselines.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning was originally proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> to preserve the privacy of data distributed on decentralized clients during model training. FedAvg and FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> were proposed as two most fundamental model averaging algorithms in FL. They can complete model training by exchanging model parameters between the PS and clients without accessing original data samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since its inception, FL has received intensive research efforts, and has been applied in various systems.
To fit in different applications, variants of FedAvg/FedSGD were devised to accelerate FL. Khalil <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et. al.</em> extended FedAvg by introducing a new sampling and aggregation strategy to improve the convergence speed when training a federated recommendation model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, Chen <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et. al.</em> proposed a federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to achieve personalized model learning. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Yu <em id="S2.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et. al.</em> proposed a neural-structure-aware resource management approach with module-based FL framework to improve the resource efficiency.

</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Regardless of application scenarios, the data diversity is always an important factor influencing the accuracy of FL. In FL, data samples are collected and privately maintained by distributed clients, which makes data sample selection and the estimation of data sample quality difficult.
In view of this difficulty, research efforts have been dedicated to diversifying data sources to improve model accuracy.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, Pu <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et. al.</em> proposed an efficient online data scheduling policy to alleviate the data skew issue caused by the capacity heterogeneity of training workers from the long-term perspective.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Wang <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et. al.</em> proposed a joint sampling and data offloading optimization problem subject to constraints on the network topology and device capacities to improve FL training accuracy. Considering the similarity of datasets collected across devices, a similarity-aware data offloading strategy was proposed in a distributed manner to optimize the data dissimilarity of each device.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, Li <em id="S2.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et. al.</em> reported that a low content diversity can lead to severe model accuracy deterioration based on trace driven analysis. A client sampling method jointly considering the statistical homogeneity and content diversity was proposed to improve model accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, all these mentioned works trying to improve the diversity of data sources failed to consider the decentralized FL scenario. Due to the lack of a centralized PS in DFL, it is rather difficult to collect necessary information to diversify data sources from a global perspective.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, FedAvg was extended to a DFL algorithm to enable learning in arbitrarily large scale networks. Same as FedAvg, the aggregation weight is proportional to the sample population failing to diversify data sources.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, Hu <em id="S2.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et. al.</em> proposed a segmented gossip aggregation approach allowing each worker to pull different model segments from chosen peers.
The objective is to optimize the utilization of the bandwidth resources between workers requiring high connectivity among workers.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, a broadcast-based algorithm was developed to minimize the sum of convex functions scatted throughout a collection of distributed nodes.
The aggregation weight of each model is merely determined by the in-degree and out-degree of each worker, which cannot effectively diversify data sources.</p>

However, pervasively deploying RSUs can be very costly.

Then, we plot the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the final model accuracy of individual vehicles in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-B Simulation Implementation ‣ IV Simulation Study ‣ Boost Decentralized Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks by Diversifying Data Sources" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. From the CDF curves of the final model accuracy, we can observe that: 1) Along vehicles’ routes (randomly generated), a vehicle can only exchange model parameters with neighbour vehicles. As a result, there exist giant discrepancies of the final model accuracy on different vehicles. The accuracy can reach 70% on CIFAR-10 or 95% on MNIST for some lucky vehicles. In contrast, the model accuracy can be lower than 30% on CIFAR-10 or 85% on MNIST for some unlucky vehicles. 2) The network topology can severely affect the final model accuracy. The model accuracy obtained on the random topology is much worse than that on the grid topology because there exist vehicles with a low connectivity with other vehicles in random topology impeding the exchange of model parameters between vehicles.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To explore the underlying reason resulting in poorer model accuracy for unlucky vehicles, we further investigate the relationship between model accuracy and data source diversity. The challenge is how to measure the data source diversity since only model parameters are maintained as vehicles exchange and aggregate models with their neighbours.
To tackle this problem, we propose to maintain state vectors on individual vehicles to track the contribution weight from each data source. The metric to measure the diversity of data sources is based on the state vector maintained by each vehicle.</p>

In the SP algorithm, each vehicle only conducts local iteration with all local samples once before it evenly partitions its parameters and broadcasts them to all neighbor vehicles. The DFL algorithm is a distributed version of the FedAvg algorithm, which regards each vehicle as a PS to execute FedAvg. Its parameters are set as the same values as our DFL-DDS except the model aggregation weights. For DFL, it assigns weights to models proportional to the sample population on each involved vehicle.</p>

The model accuracy in the grid network is the best one while the accuracy in the spider network is the worst one. The reason is that both the degrees of junctions and the lengths of each road segments are uniform in grid network implying a high connectivity among vehicles. In the random network, some junctions have a low degree, which leads to a low connectivity for some unlucky vehicles. In the spider network, the perimeters of different circles are highly different, and vehicles in outer circles have sparser connectivity with other vehicles. Overall speaking, if the road network is more irregular and sparser, it is possible that more vehicles will have difficulties to diversify their data sources resulting in lower model accuracy.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DFL is naturally feasible for vehicular networks.
However, the low training efficiency is the major obstacle impeding the wide application of DFL.
Through a simulation study, we unveil that the lack of data source diversity is a main reason resulting in poor model accuracy.
To address this problem, we propose a novel DFL-DDS algorithm by maximizing the data source diversity contributed to the model trained on individual vehicles.
Meanwhile, we elaborate implementation issues of DFL-DDS by considering practical issues.
Experimental results conducted with public datasets confirm the superiority of DFL-DDS.</p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This work as our initial attempt to improve DFL is insightful for future works in this area. Our future work includes two possible aspects.
Firstly, communication unreliability has not been considered in our algorithm. In other words, vehicle communications can be interrupted due to various reasons such that models cannot be completely exchanged between vehicles. Robust strategies should be developed that can tolerate information loss.
Secondly, we assume a static target state vector in our work. In practice, the sample population on vehicles can be a dynamic variable. A dynamic lightweight algorithm is needed to timely adjust the target state vector.</p>
