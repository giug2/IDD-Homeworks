<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text">Federated learning (FL), a novel branch of distributed machine learning (ML), develops global models through a private procedure without direct access to local datasets. However, it is still possible to access the model updates (gradient updates of deep neural networks) transferred between clients and servers, potentially revealing sensitive local information to adversaries using model inversion attacks. Differential privacy (DP) offers a promising approach to addressing this issue by adding noise to the parameters. On the other hand, heterogeneities in data structure, storage, communication, and computational capabilities of devices can cause convergence problems and delays in developing the global model. A personalized weighted averaging of local parameters based on the resources of each device can yield a better aggregated model in each round. In this paper, to efficiently preserve privacy, we propose a personalized DP framework that injects noise based on clients’ relative impact factors and aggregates parameters while considering heterogeneities and adjusting properties. To fulfill the DP requirements, we first analyze the convergence boundary of the FL algorithm when impact factors are personalized and fixed throughout the learning process. We then further study the convergence property considering time-varying (adaptive) impact factors.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Smart distributed systems such as smartphones, automated vehicles, multi-agent systems, and wearable devices are growing rapidly in our daily lives. Their underlying mechanism which is attached with sensing and communicating generates an unprecedented amount of data every day. Therefore, utilizing these sources of rich information to enhance services offered to people and organizations owning the data, without violating their privacy, matters a great deal. The developments in the computational and communicational capabilities of intelligent distributed devices along with their abilities to collect and store large datasets have opened up effective alternatives for managing and analyzing local databases.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A common traditional practice to develop predictive machine learning (ML) models is to transmit raw data over networks and generate models in a centralized manner. While this method has provided data owners valuable services throughout the years, their efficiency for today’s crowdsourced data is called into question. Communication costs of sending large volumes of data on one hand, and privacy concerns for sharing personal information on the other hand have provided space for decentralized ML algorithms, such as federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated machine learning is a promising solution in settings dealing with large volumes of data as well as privacy concerns about clients’ sensitive information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In this framework, each device builds its model using local datasets, and the essential model parameters, rather than raw data, are transmitted to the cloud server. The server aggregates these parameters and updates the global model throughout a recursive downloading and uploading cycle <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Hence, each client benefits from a larger database during the learning process, without direct access to it. While offering great advantages over conventional ML methods, FL has its own challenges. Expensive communications, systems and statistical heterogeneities, and security risks are considered as the four main issues while developing FL models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Deep Learning (DL) models are widely used in FL, especially for feature extraction in the large image, voice, and text datasets. In order to optimize local DL models inside the clients, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is generally adopted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Sending frequent gradient updates with the massive number of both parameters and clients in FL leads to an extreme rise in communication costs. Increasing the number of local updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> is one natural way to modify communication bottlenecks with more local computations. On the other hand, quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and sparsification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> methods mitigate this challenge by reducing the size of transmitted messages in each round.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Dealing with systems that have different computational capabilities, network capacities, and power resources is an inevitable challenge in FL. Several approaches, including resource-based client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, robust and fault-tolerant algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and asynchronous communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> address these challenges. On the other extreme, heterogeneity in data distributions of the clients causes problems in the training and convergence of FL algorithms. Using multi-task learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and avoiding local minimums by adding a proximal term to the objective function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> help handling unbalanced and non-IID data in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Even though the idea of FL was first proposed for its strong privacy guarantees, it has been shown that local datasets can be still revealed to stragglers using model inversion attacks on shared updates <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, especially when DL is used in local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. To mitigate this challenge, differential privacy (DP) is one of the widely used protection algorithms due to its solid theoretical guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. In order to reduce the risk of data leakage in ML algorithms, noise with Gaussian, Laplace, or Exponential distribution is deliberately added to data in DP. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposes a global DP algorithm in FL and gives a theoretical explanation for the convergence behavior of the suggested scheme.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed earlier, nodes in a distributed architecture differ in the data structure, dataset size, network condition, reliability, availability, and computation capabilities, which can even be time-varying. A privacy-preserving approach in FL is not effective unless paying attention to these personalized characteristics. Hence, there exist multiple works on DP with the content “adaptive” to compensate systems and statistical heterogeneities in FL. These works can be divided into two general directions based on the adaptability criterion. One direction injects an adaptive noise distribution to local parameters to enhance local protection. It considers each client separately without involving their heterogeneity. For instance, adaptive clipping  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> finds the best clipping constant for DP in each device based on their local behaviors. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, noise with Laplace distribution is added to model updates based on the neurons’ contributions in the clients. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> achieves a trade-off between privacy and accuracy by adding more noise to less important parameters and less noise to more important ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The second direction, however, concentrates on personalized training in the heterogeneous networks. The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> trains differentially private models in each client and uploads the local updates for the server. These directions both lack considering the local characteristics in the aggregating process. More specifically, they assume the same impact factor for all devices during aggregation, regardless of their local dissimilarities. This assumption not only simplifies the convergence analysis of the algorithm but also changes the DP requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, the privacy and convergence analysis in FL with non-identical and time-varying impact factors have not yet been studied in the existing literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we combine the heterogeneity and privacy concerns in a novel FL scheme. Regardless of multi-task learning algorithms used in FL, each local model possesses a weight or an impact in the global cost function. This impact can be assigned considering many factors by the server or the clients. It can also change (increase or decrease) or even become zero during the learning process. We, therefore, propose a DP algorithm considering the non-identical impact factors, namely, personalized aggregation in differentially private federated learning (PADPFL). We further establish the convergence analysis of the algorithm and the influence of the additive noise on it.</p>

For this reason, the goal of our approach is to protect the weights transmitted between the server and clients from being inferred any extra information about users to both the server or external adversaries.

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While working collaboratively with possibly millions of users, even when datasets have the same nature, the quality of information used in local models is not the same. For instance, while modelling image datasets, the resolution of data varies between the clients, and hence, training local models based on low-quality images reduces the global model performance. Moreover, the reliability of local datasets can influence the validity of models, as they may contain irrelevant information. So, users can send additional bits to the cloud server, based on local model performances, to help the server assign relevant impact factors. On the other hand, the size of local datasets does not necessarily affect impact factors directly. In Non-IID structures, we may have valuable informative datasets that are relatively small in size, but global models should be biased in favor of them.

<p id="S7.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we presented a personalized privacy preserving approach in federated learning models. Considering the systems and statistical heterogeneities in distributed architectures, we have first focused on the roles that impact factors play in obtaining the best model performance. We further clarified that the impacts are not necessarily fixed during training the global model and undergo changes. Hence, the influence each client has on learning can increase, decrease, or become zero while <math id="S7.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}=1" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><msubsup id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml"><mo id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.2" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.2.cmml">∑</mo><mrow id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.2" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.2.cmml">i</mi><mo id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.1" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.3" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><mi id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.3" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.3.cmml">N</mi></msubsup><msub id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">p</mi><mi id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.3.cmml">i</mi></msub></mrow><mo id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><apply id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1">subscript</csymbol><sum id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.2"></sum><apply id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3"><eq id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.1"></eq><ci id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.2">𝑖</ci><cn type="integer" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.2.3.3">1</cn></apply></apply><ci id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.3">𝑁</ci></apply><apply id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.2">𝑝</ci><ci id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply></apply><cn type="integer" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p1.1.m1.1c">\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}=1</annotation></semantics></math> applies.
