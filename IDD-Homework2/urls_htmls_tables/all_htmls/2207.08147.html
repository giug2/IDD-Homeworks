<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning enables many applications benefiting distributed and private datasets of a large number of potential data-holding clients. However, different clients usually have their own particular objectives in terms of the tasks to be learned from the data. So, supporting federated learning with meta-learning tools such as multi-task learning and transfer learning will help enlarge the set of potential applications of federated learning by letting clients of different but related tasks share task-agnostic models that can be then further updated and tailored by each individual client for its particular task. In a federated multi-task learning problem, the trained deep neural network model should be fine-tuned for the respective objective of each client while sharing some parameters for more generalizability. We propose to train a deep neural network model with more generalized layers closer to the input and more personalized layers to the output. We achieve that by introducing layer types such as pre-trained, common, task-specific, and personal layers. We provide simulation results to highlight particular scenarios in which meta-learning-based federated learning proves to be useful.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Data privacy is of utmost importance with the increasing amount of digital data. The conventional deep learning methods require the collection and storage of the training data, which may contain sensitive information about the users.
At the same time, modern data-oriented applications increasingly adopt distributed learning algorithms for training their models. Also, in most applications, the user data are generated and stored on the user-owned edge devices such as mobile phones and laptops. Today’s security and utility requirements call for machine learning schemes that allow distributed training of the models on user devices.
In this regard, federated learning paves the way for the privacy-aware training of machine learning models by removing the necessity for storing the data centrally. The distributed training scheme provided by the federated learning algorithms enables the efficient training of the models by training the local models and sharing only the model parameters with a centralized server. Federated learning mechanism exploits the computational resources of the users to distribute the load from the server while enabling the users to train better models.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In some cases, clients in a federated learning problem may be subject to different objectives. By using federated multi-task learning methods, clients with different tasks and data distribution are able to cooperate in a federated learning environment.
It is also possible to bootstrap federated learning algorithms by employing transfer learning methods in federated learning problems.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The idea of federated learning was first presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> with the introduction of the FedAvg algorithm. FedAvg algorithm selects a random subset of the clients in each round and aggregates the model updates of the clients by averaging. Federated learning enables securely training machine learning models using distributed data while preserving the privacy of the users.
More information on federated learning can be found in the overview article <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and the survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed to add personalized layers to the models of each client and train those layers personally while training the base layers using the conventional federated learning scheme. In this way, they aimed to reduce the effects of statistical heterogeneity. That idea is similar to the technique proposed in this paper; however, we propose a more general framework and apply it to the multi-task learning problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The tasks of the clients are not necessarily the same in a federated learning environment. Clients with different tasks may cooperate for training a shared model in a federated environment. Even the source and target domains of the client datasets may differ in a federated learning setup.
A federated multi-task learning algorithm named MOCHA is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> for convex models, such as  <span title="support vector machine" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_long">support vector machine</span></span> (<abbr title="support vector machine" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">SVM</span></abbr>).
The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposes a federated multi-task learning algorithm for learning non-convex models.
A federated multi-task learning algorithm is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. It enables personalized training of a federated deep neural network model by introducing batch normalization layers into the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another formulation for sharing model parameters in a federated learning algorithm is federated transfer learning.
A federated transfer learning framework is proposed for wearable healthcare in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The authors suggest a two-stage learning algorithm by performing conventional federated learning in the first stage and then fine-tuning personalized models in the next stage.
Another two-stage federated transfer learning for personalized model training is introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. These authors try to find an initial model that can be fine-tuned by each client in the second stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Multi-task learning is a sub-area of transfer learning. However, it is generally referred to as a separate category due to its wide range of applications. Both fields can be grouped under the field of meta-learning. Meta-learning is a well-studied and active area of machine learning. More meta-learning methods could be adopted into the field of federated learning in the future. A comprehensive overview of meta-learning approaches can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In a federated multi-task learning problem, the trained deep neural network model should be fine-tuned for the respective objective of each client while sharing some parameters for more generalizability. The first layers of a deep neural network learn more general features, while the deeper layers learn more specialized features. Following the properties of the networks mentioned above, we propose to train a deep neural network model with more generalized layers closer to the input and more personalized layers to the output. We achieve that by introducing layer types such as pre-trained, common, task-specific, and personal layers.</p>

<p id="S2.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel generalized framework for multi-task federated learning applications. We propose a layered, hierarchical architecture for training federated learning models. We divide the layers of the deep learning model into four different groups: (i) The pre-trained layers, adopted from a pre-trained model trained on a similar task using the transfer learning methods, (ii) Common layers, trained using the conventional federated learning scheme, in which the parameters are shared by all the clients in the network, (iii) Task-specific layers, trained cooperatively by the clients having the same objective, (iv) Personal layers, trained separately by each client in the network. We demonstrated the proposed scheme using the deep neural network architecture as a machine learning model due to its layered structure. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is applicable to any machine learning model because it is a generalized framework.
Although there are several studies in the literature that employs the idea of personal layers, clustered federated learning, or transfer learning, this paper is the first study to propose a generalized framework combining these ideas to the best of the authors’ knowledge.</p>

<p id="S2.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We created a multi-label face dataset using the StyleGAN2<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> network. The image samples are labeled according to five different categories such as gender, age group, wearing glasses or not, pose angle, and the visibility of teeth. The proposed multi-task face dataset is used for demonstration of the advantages of the proposed federated multi-task learning framework. We performed extensive simulations for comparing the proposed framework to the cases such as separate or joint training of a centralized dataset, separate, or conventional federated learning training of the distributed dataset. We also further increase the performance of the proposed architecture by utilizing the transfer learning methods. As an example, we used the lower layers of the pre-trained VGG-Face<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> CNN model for our deep learning model.

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this framework, we consider deep transfer learning, where we train a deep neural network model using the algorithms from both transfer and multi-task learning. The trained deep neural network model consists of four different layer types. There may be multiple layers for each layer type. In the lower layers of the model, there are pre-trained layers in order to utilize conventional transfer learning. Those layers may be adopted from a deep neural network model that was previously trained on a dataset that has a similar feature domain. The layers of the second type are the common layers that are connected to the output of the pre-trained layers. The weights of the common layers are shared by all the clients and trained using the conventional federated learning scheme. That is, the local updates of each client are aggregated in each round of the algorithm. The next layer type is the task-specific layers, which are trained separately for each client group. A client group consists of clients that share the same objective. The round updates for the task-specific layers are aggregated among the clients with the same task using federated learning algorithms. A separate server could be allocated for each task group in order to distribute the computational and communication load of the central server. The last layer type is the personal layer that is trained separately by each client. The architecture for the proposed algorithm is visualized in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III Proposed Multi-Task Federated Learning Framework ‣ Multi-Task and Transfer Learning for Federated Learning Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

There are 100 clients in the system and five client groups corresponding to five different labels in the dataset. Hence, we have 20 clients per group.
We performed the simulations using Python programming language and Tensorflow framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.

Following that idea, we used the VGG-Face network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> for transfer learning for the pre-trained layers.

The VGG-Face model was trained on 2.6M face images. The input shape is (224,224,3) for the VGG-Face architecture. We discard the last fully connected layer and connect the output of the fully connected layer 7 (FC7), which has an output dimension of 4096, to the input of the fine-tuning layers.

As expected, the performance of the centralized dataset cases is the highest for each task. There is no significant difference in the accuracy values for the centralized separate and joint training cases.
The performance in the distributed data and separate training case is the worst because the models are trained with a small amount of local data by each client.
The accuracy values get significantly higher for each task in both federated learning scenarios. This performance gap may provide an incentive for a client to participate in a federated learning environment.
For our dataset, there is not a significant performance difference between the separate and multi-task federated learning cases. However, the federated multi-task learning algorithm has the advantage that only a single model needs to be trained.</p>

The dataset was constructed by accelerometer and gyroscope measurements obtained through the mobile phones of the subjects. The samples are labeled by one of the six activities performed by the subjects: (i) walking, (ii) walking upstairs, (iii) walking downstairs, (iv) sitting, (v) standing, (vi) laying.
We modeled each subject as a different task. Hence, we have 30 tasks and one client per each task.
We used the feature vectors with the length of 561 provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
In this experiment, we do not employ pre-trained layers since there is no available pre-trained model for the tasks. Since we model each subject as a task, the task layers and the personal layers are merged.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, the dataset of each subject has the same objective, which is the label of their physical activity; however, the distribution of the features is not the same. Hence, the classification tasks of each subject are modeled separately.
We used a multi-layer perceptron as a deep learning architecture. We fixed the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes on each layer for all scenarios. The number of hidden dense layers is three, with the number of nodes 128, 64, and 32, respectively. We used <abbr title="stochastic gradient descent" class="ltx_glossaryref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_glossary_short">SGD</span></abbr> as an optimizer and optimized the learning rates and the batch size using a parameter grid.
We trained the deep learning model in three different scenarios for comparison. In the first scenario, we trained a single model using the whole dataset, i.e., the datasets of the subjects are combined. In the second scenario, we trained a separate model for the dataset of each subject. Hence, we obtained 30 different models. Finally, we trained the deep learning classifier using the proposed federated multi-task learning framework.</p>

Due to the difference in the underlying data distributions, the trained centralized joint training performs the worst among the scenarios we considered. On the other hand, separate training of the models for each subject gives us better results in terms of classification accuracy. The proposed federated multi-task learning framework provides the best results since it enables personalized training for the tasks. The change of the test accuracy for each scenario is provided in Fig. <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI Additional Experiments ‣ Multi-Task and Transfer Learning for Federated Learning Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Although the centralized training provides a faster convergence speed at the first rounds, it converges to a smaller accuracy value. On the other hand, the separate training converges slowly but to a higher accuracy value than the centralized training. The proposed method provides convergence to a higher accuracy value.</p>
