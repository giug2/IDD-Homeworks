<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has attracted increasing attention to building models without accessing the raw user data, especially in healthcare.
In real applications, different federations can seldom work together due to possible reasons such as data heterogeneity and distrust/inexistence of the central server.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework called <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MetaFed</span> to facilitate trustworthy FL between different federations.
MetaFed obtains a personalized model for each federation without a central server via the proposed Cyclic Knowledge Distillation.
Specifically, MetaFed treats each federation as a meta distribution and aggregates knowledge of each federation in a <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cyclic</em> manner.
The training is split into two parts: common knowledge accumulation and personalization.
Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that MetaFed without a server achieves better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 10%+ accuracy improvement compared to the baseline for PAMAP2) with fewer communication costs.
More importantly, MetaFed shows remarkable performance in real healthcare-related applications.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning, especially deep learning, has become prominent in people’s daily lives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
It is applied to many health-related fields such as human activity recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, medical images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and other fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
However, with the increasing awareness of data privacy and security, some countries and organizations released policies to prevent data leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In this situation, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> was proposed and becomes increasingly popular.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed the first FL algorithm called FedAvg to aggregate clients’ information.
FedAvg replaces direct data exchanges with model parameter communication to preserve data privacy.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> offers a review of federated learning and it groups federated learning into three categorizes, including horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and transfer federated learning.
Although FedAvg achieves promising performance in many applications, it may not be feasible in more challenging situations.
For example, when meeting non-iid data, FedAvg will suffer from slow convergence and low accuracy.
Therefore, some federated learning methods, e.g. FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, are proposed to solve these concrete problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In reality, the situations can be more difficult.
Medical institutions may be grouped into multiple federations and no higher-level governing organizations exist.
Consider a real example.
Several hospitals form a federation which is called the inner-hospital federation while several medical companies, providing service to consumers at home, form another federation which is called the outer-hospital federation.
Obviously, we can perform FedAvg inside both two federations.
But, how can we combine these two federations?
There is no higher-level server and existing methods, e.g. FedAvg and FedBN, all fail in this situation.

Inside each federation, different FL algorithms can be used to train a model.
However, it remains unclear how to build personalized FL models outside the federations, i.e., FL among different federations.
Moreover, data heterogeneity widely exists in these federations.
We view each federation as a meta distribution and view the problem in this situation as meta federated learning.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>We use meta and federation interchangeably.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we propose <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MetaFed</span>, a meta federated learning framework for cross-federation federated learning.
We focus on inter-federation federated learning in this paper and each federation can be viewed as an independent individual.
To implement MetaFed, we propose a cyclic knowledge distillation method.
MetaFed can solve data islanding and data statistical heterogeneity without requiring a server or sacrificing user privacy.
Specifically, MetaFed consists of two stages, common knowledge accumulation stage and personalization stage.
In the first stage, the model trained on the previous meta federation serves as the teacher for the next federation and knowledge distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> aims to make use of the common information.
Several rounds with fixed hyperparameters for knowledge distillation are performed to ensure enough common knowledge.
In personalization stage, we utilize KD with adapted hyperparameters to obtain personalized model for each federation.
Through knowledge distillation, it can not only acquire common knowledge among federations but also cope with feature shifts and label shifts.
Moreover, MetaFed is extensible and can be deployed to many applications.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning has shown its superior in many application fields, especially in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
From the simplest application where human daily activities are recognized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to the most difficult one where brain tumors can be classified <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, machine learning can exert its effectiveness.
In a common framework, it often first collects lots of labeled data, then extracts features, and finally trains a classifier.
Unfortunately, the quality and number of collected labeled data in the first step often have a significant impact on the application.
In many real applications, especially healthcare-related ones, obtaining centralized data is impossible.
Although multiple persons or organizations generate a large amount of data, few of them are willing to share their private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, a large number of regulations have emerged, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, to protect data privacy and security.
These factors make data form separate data islands where learning a model with aggregated data cannot work.
<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In addition, heterogeneous data statistics can be another issue that seriously hinders the development of machine learning in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</span>
Therefore, how to learn a robust model without directly exchanging data becomes a trend.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To make full use of data in different separate clients and protect data privacy and security simultaneously, Google <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> first proposed FedAvg to train machine learning models via aggregating distributed mobile phones’ data with exchanging model parameters instead of directly exchanging data.
FedAvg can work well with data islanding problems in many applications although it is simple.
Subsequently, Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> wrote the first survey of FL research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has attracted growing attention in many applications.
And the traditional and simple FedAvg cannot satisfy complicated realistic scenes.
When meeting data statistical heterogeneity, FedAvg may converge slowly and acquire large amounts of communication cost.
Moreover, since only a shared global model is obtained, the model may degrade when predicting in personalized clients.
Some work tries to cope with these problems.
FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> added a proximal term to FedAvg which referred to the global model and allowed slight differences when training local models.
Yu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> combined three traditional adaptation techniques: fine-tuning, multi-task learning, and knowledge distillation into federated models.
Most recently, FedBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> tried to cope with feature shifts among clients by preserving local batch normalization parameters which can represent data distributions to some extent.
<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">FED-ROD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> paid attention to both generalization and personalization.</span>
Some other work made an effort to utilize personalization federated learning in the healthcare field <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a federated transfer learning framework that needs some sharing data while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed FedAP which could achieve personalized performance via aggregating with clients’ similarities.
However, these methods need a server and have some limits in communication costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this situation where no server exists, FedAvg even cannot be implemented.
Sequential training may be a reasonable solution.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> proposed FedFMC that dynamically forked devices into updating different global models and merged models in a lifelong way.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> leveraged the sequential training of subgroups of heterogeneous clients to emulate the centralized paradigm.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> assigned clients to homogeneous groups to minimize the overall distribution divergence among groups.
These methods still rely heavily on parallel federated learning where sequential training round style with only one round and no closed loop is just an aid.</p>

BrainTorrent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> presented a highly dynamic peer-to-peer environment, where all centers directly interacted with each other without depending on a central body.
It seemed disorderly and chaotic, and it required lots of communication costs.
Nicola Rieke et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> considered key factors to federated learning while FedH2L <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> utilized mutual distillation to exchange posteriors on a shared seed set between participants in a decentralized manner.

However, these methods often require large communication costs, and few are designed for personalization federation federated learning.
No work pays attention to proposing a new paradigm for personalized federated learning among federations without a server.</p>

Nowadays, as a common technique, knowledge distillation is also applied to federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
Though mimicking the global model and the local previous model, different implementations can be flexibly applied to different situations.</p>

How to make them communicate equally without any other governors and share common knowledge without direct data exchange is the key.
MetaFed aims to accumulate common knowledge and preserve personalized information without compromising data privacy and security via knowledge distillation in a cyclic way.

In common knowledge accumulation stage, the federations are trained in order and the previous trained one serves as the teacher for the next one.
The common knowledge accumulation stage lasts for several rounds to ensure each federation’s common knowledge are extracted completely.
Personalization stage is also trained in the same style but the model is sent to the next federation without local training for losing no common knowledge.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This stage happens in the first part of the whole training process.
In this stage, federations are trained sequentially in a cyclic way and the previous meta knowledge is transferred to the next one via knowledge distillation.
The knowledge which is useful for the current federation will be preserved via knowledge distillation while the others that are useless will be discarded.
With several rounds of cyclic training, the knowledge that is useful for all federations will be preserved and we denote this type of knowledge as common knowledge.
Our first stage is just to accumulate common knowledge and the specific detail can be found in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ III-C Common Knowledge Accumulation Stage ‣ Sec.

<p id="S3.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Surprisingly, MetaFed can be a more flexible framework, just as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ How to determine inheritance or discard ‣ III-E Summary ‣ Sec. III Method ‣ MetaFed: Federated Learning among Federations with Cyclic Knowledge Distillation for Personalized Healthcare" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and we call this universal situation as MetaFed++.
MetaFed++ imitates the Internet to transmit information.
Federations are scattered around and possible connecting paths are used to transmit information.
MetaFed++ categorizes different federations into multiple groups and performs both inter-group and intra-group communications via cyclic knowledge distillation.
The graph structure is flexible and changeable.
We can even treat groups as new federations and perform MetaFed++ among groups.
Besides, link paths can also be dynamic.
In reality, we can group by geography, organizations, and some other real rules.
In experiments, we can group by similarities among feature statistics following FedAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
Obviously, we can easily extend MetaFed to MetaFed++ for larger and more flexible real-world applications.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">To further prove the superiority of our method, we also adopt a public time-series benchmark with feature shifts, PAMAP2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
PAMAP2 is a human activity recognition with data of 18 human activities performed by 9 subjects.
We use 3 inertial measurement units’ data with 27 channels and utilize the sliding window technique to preprocess data.
12 classes with 12291 instances are selected.
Since there are no natural sub-datasets in PAMAP2, we split artificially PAMAP2 into four sub-datasets according to persons and we call this task a cross-person task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.
9 subjects are divided into four groups, [3,2,8],[1,5],[0,7],[4,6] where different numbers denote different persons, and we try our best to make each domain have a similar number of data.
Similar to VLCS, we choose <math id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">10</mn><mo id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.1.m1.1c">10\%</annotation></semantics></math> for training, <math id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">10</mn><mo id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.2.m2.1c">10\%</annotation></semantics></math> for validation, and <math id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">20</mn><mo id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">20</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px1.p1.3.m3.1c">20\%</annotation></semantics></math> for testing.

We have the following observations from these results.

However, it is slightly worse than FedBN in Federation 0 and slightly worse than FedProx in Federation 3.
We think that the task is so simple that some methods, e.g. FedProx, with few techniques for feature shifts can work slightly better.
And the improvements on some federations with a drop less than <math id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.SSS3.Px3.p1.2.m2.1c">1\%</annotation></semantics></math> do not illustrate that our method is unacceptable.
2) Similar to VLCS, in this feature shift situation, FedBN has a better performance compared FedAvg and FedProx.
Simultaneously, FedAvg and FedProx have a similar performance to FedBN.</p>

2) In this situation, 20 federations in total make the problem more complicated.
Although our method does not achieve the best performance on each federation, it still achieves acceptable results on almost every federation.
3) Compared to FedAvg and FedProx, FedBN and our method achieve remarkable improvement, which may illustrate that FedBN can also cope with label shifts sometimes.</p>

We do not use the common <math id="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">f</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑓</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.m1.1c">f</annotation></semantics></math> for testing but each local model with local adaptation brought by knowledge distillation does testing.
There also exist slight differences between results under feature shifts and label shifts.
When feature shifts exist, common knowledge accumulation stage may play a more important role compared to personalization stage and there is a further improvement with personalization stage.
Finetune seems to bring no improvement.
When label shifts exist, Fine-tune can bring slight improvements while both two stages work well.</p>

Among five hyperparameters, whether to share BN parameters has minimal impact on the final results.
We also perform parameter sensitivity on PAMAP2 under feature shifts.
As shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F8.sf6" title="In Figure 8 ‣ Dataset ‣ IV-B2 Medical Image Classification ‣ IV-B Experiments on Label Shifts ‣ Sec.

Moreover, similar to the results under label shifts, whether to share BN parameters has slight impact on the final results.
The results reveal that MetaFed is more effective and robust than other methods under different hyperparameters in most cases.</p>

2) In this real application under label shifts, FedBN does not achieve the second-best performance, since it is originally designed for feature shifts.
Instead, FedProx achieves the second best while FedAvg even performs better than FedBN.</p>

Until now, there exist no disease-modifying drugs (drugs that target the causes or damage) are approved for Parkinson’s.
Large amounts of costs are paid for PD, as a study based on 2017 data estimated that the US economic PD burden at $51.9 billion, including direct medical costs of $25.4 billion and $26.5 billion in indirect and non-medical costs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>.

At the same time, the mobile phone collects corresponding data and uploads them to the hospital where the patient belongs to.
The cloud in the corresponding hospital will offer an estimation score, from 0 to 4 (from normal to severe).
Then the corresponding doctor can directly have an estimation of the patient’s situation.
This tool can greatly reduce the pressure on doctors and brings patients a better medical experience.</p>

Since 167 patients are distributed in 16 hospitals and each hospital can not directly exchange data with others, a federated learning method is required to construct personalized models for each hospital.
More notably, due to different hobbies, lifestyles, body shapes, devices, etc, there naturally exist feature shifts on data among different hospitals.
Simplified, in this task, we only predict whether the person is with PD.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we proposed MetaFed which uses cyclic knowledge distillation for meta federated learning.
MetaFed organizes federations in another novel style that does not require a central server.
Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MetaFed.
Moreover, MetaFed has shown its superiority in real health-related applications.
In the future, we plan to combine MetaFed with common methods such as FedAvg, to implement a complete federated learning system, including intra- and inter- federations.
We also plan to apply MetaFed for heterogeneity architectures and more realistic healthcare applications.</p>
