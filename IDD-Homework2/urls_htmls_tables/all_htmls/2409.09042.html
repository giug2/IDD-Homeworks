<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Cooperative perception, offering a wider field of view than standalone perception, is becoming increasingly crucial in autonomous driving. This perception is enabled through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, allowing connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to exchange sensor data, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, thereby enhancing the collective understanding of the environment. In this paper, we leverage an importance map to distill critical semantic information, introducing a cooperative perception semantic communication framework that employs intermediate fusion. To counter the challenges posed by time-varying multipath fading, our approach incorporates the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) along with channel estimation and equalization strategies. Furthermore, recognizing the necessity for reliable transmission, especially in the low SNR scenarios, we introduce a novel semantic error detection method that is integrated with our semantic communication framework in the spirit of hybrid automatic repeated request (HARQ). Simulation results show that our model surpasses the traditional separate source-channel coding methods in perception performance, both with and without HARQ. Additionally, in terms of throughput, our proposed HARQ schemes demonstrate superior efficiency to the conventional coding approaches.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Shannon’s separation theorem in the 1940s has long been a cornerstone in the field of communication. It suggests that source and channel coding could be optimized separately to approach ideal transmission rates with sufficiently large coding blocks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">1</span></a>]</cite>. However, modern wireless communication, driven by the urgency of real-time applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous vehicles, necessitates a departure from this traditional paradigm. The infinite block lengths, idealized in Shannon’s theory, clash with the practical demands for low latency and minimal computational complexity in time varying wireless communication scenarios. To address these challenges, semantic communication with joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has been proposed. This method tailors the coding process to specific tasks, optimizing both source and channel coding in unison for improved performance. The initial exploration of JSCC, applied to text transmission, utilized recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to improve semantic fidelity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">2</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">3</span></a>]</cite>. Concurrently, deep learning-based JSCC systems were designed to directly convert image pixel values into complex channel input symbols, bypassing the traditional separate stages of compression and channel coding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">4</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">5</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">6</span></a>]</cite>. Moreover, in the domain of video transmission, JSCC strategies have been applied to video compression, channel coding, and modulation into a single neural network-based operation, streamlining the transmission process and optimizing bandwidth usage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">7</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">8</span></a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Essential for autonomous vehicles, sensor data, particularly light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, contains critical semantic content <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">9</span></a>]</cite>. Autonomous vehicles often face limited perception capabilities due to obstructions, such as buildings and trees. To circumvent these limitations, the concept of cooperative perception has been explored, where connected automated vehicles (CAVs) share their sensor data to achieve a composite view of their surroundings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">9</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">10</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">11</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">12</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">13</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">14</span></a>]</cite>. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is the cornerstone of this system, facilitating the exchange of a wide array of data types, from raw sensory inputs to processed detection outputs, along with crucial metadata, such as timestamps and positional information. Cooperative perception leverages various fusion techniques, which can be categorized into early, intermediate, and late fusion, each with distinct communication demands. Early fusion, which transits raw LiDAR point clouds, demands the highest amount of resources. Intermediate fusion processes and condenses raw data into more manageable features, striking a balance between resource usage and performance efficacy. Late fusion focuses on sharing the final detection results from each CAV, conserving resources but potentially sacrificing accuracy. Typically, intermediate fusion is preferred in cooperative perception due to its efficiency in resource utilization while retaining the potential to achieve the same level of performance as early fusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Building on intermediate fusion, various innovative solutions have been investigated to strike a balance between perception performance and communication overhead. For instance, the selective handshake mechanism in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">15</span></a>]</cite> identifies and connects the most pertinent CAVs. This mechanism employs a learning-based approach to dynamically form communication groups and determines the optimal timing for data exchange. In addition, the innovative approach to source coding through an end-to-end learning framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">16</span></a>]</cite> employs a spatially aware graph neural network (GNN) to effectively aggregate information collected from CAVs. However, these methods often assumes flawless communication between CAVs, disregarding the potential channel impairments. To address this gap, the novel semantic communication scheme for cooperative perception in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">17</span></a>]</cite> showcases the potential of semantic communication in enhancing cooperative perception.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Due to safety considerations in autonomous driving, data reliability becomes particularly crucial in cooperative perception. Previous approaches cannot guarantee the transmission reliability under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, posing a significant challenge for the deployment of these technologies in real-world scenarios. Traditionally, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocols have been utilized in communication systems to bolster transmission reliability. However, there is limited research on the application of HARQ within semantic communication systems, especially those customized for cooperative perception. Existing studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">8</span></a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite> typically center around the design of error detection methods and aim to ensure the integrity of the reconstructed data rather than the successful completion of task-oriented objectives. These methods, while valuable for reconstruction tasks, may not fully align with the specific requirements of applications, such as cooperative perception, where the ultimate goal extends beyond mere data reconstruction. Designing error detection methods and HARQ protocols for task-oriented semantic communication systems, such as cooperative perception, is challenging. It encompasses not only ensuring the robustness and reliability of data transmission in adverse communication environments but also aligning the error correction mechanisms with the semantic goals of the system.</p>

To strike a balance between perception accuracy and communication overhead, we employ an importance map generator to identify the most crucial elements within the entire feature set.

It involves adding cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits to the transmitted data packets and applying forward error-correction (FEC) encoding. The receiver performs FEC decoding and CRC check on the received data. If errors are detected, the receiver will discard the data associated with the erroneous group and send a negative acknowledgment (NACK) signal, requesting the retransmission of the same data from the previous frame.</p>

Hence, in HARQ-II, the transmitted data during the initial transmission and subsequent retransmissions typically differ.

Unlike conventional systems where CRC is used for error detection, our proposed method transmits features directly, bypassing the need for quantization and CRC. This necessitates the development of a semantic-based error detection method to identify semantic errors as traditional CRC cannot be applied to unquantized data. Moreover, to design novel HARQ mechanisms that align with JSCC in our system, similar to traditional HARQ-I and HARQ-II strategies but with semantic considerations. It is an open area for research.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In traditional transmission systems, CRC error detection is typically employed to facilitate automatic retransmission requests, ensuring the correct reception of transmitted data alongside feedback acknowledgments (ACKs). However, the conventional CRC method might flag a transmission as erroneous if the bit-error rate (BER) is non-zero, even when the transmitted content is semantically very close to the original. In semantic communication, the focus shifts from bit-level precision to semantic similarity. For instance, in sentence semantic communication systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">18</span></a>]</cite>, the BERT model, a pre-trained neural network, is utilized to assess sentence similarities. However, many task-oriented semantic communication systems, including our proposed cooperative perception framework, do not inherently possess a mechanism like BERT for semantic similarity evaluation. Therefore, we propose a semantic-based error detection approach, termed SimCRC, and develop a novel method to measure semantic similarity between the original feature <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="F_{i}^{(t)}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml">F</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.3.cmml">i</mi><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.2">𝐹</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.2.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">F_{i}^{(t)}</annotation></semantics></math> and its reconstructed counterpart <math id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\hat{F}_{i}^{(t)}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.2.cmml">F</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.1.cmml">^</mo></mover><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.3.cmml">i</mi><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml">t</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2"><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.1">^</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.2.2">𝐹</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.2.2.3">𝑖</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">\hat{F}_{i}^{(t)}</annotation></semantics></math>, in terms of a similarity score <math id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="S" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">S</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝑆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.3.m3.1c">S</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

For source coding, 8-bit quantization is adopted. It is important to note that the perception performance remains unaffected by the 8-bit quantization by carefully selecting an appropriate quantization step size and zero point. Additionally, for channel coding, we consider a 1/2-rate Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code with a code length of 5,376. Following the channel coding, modulation is performed using either 16-QAM or 256-QAM. This comparison is designed to offer insights into the performance enhancements provided by our method, especially in scenarios where HARQ is not utilized.</p>

Meanwhile, the proposed method exhibits smoother performance in low SNR regimes without the cliff effect, which is commonly observed in the traditional communication systems. Hence, our proposed method can prevent catastrophic perception performance loss in the low SNR regimes, which is critical to autonomous driving. Moreover, our method significantly outperforms the traditional schemes and approaches the performance upper bound constrained by the cooperative perception module at SNR = 9 dB. On the one hand, traditional coding combined with low-order modulation achieves better performance in the low SNR regimes and reaches its maximum performance at SNR = 9 dB. On the other hand, despite performing worse than low-order modulation in the low SNR regimes, high-order modulation reaches its maximum performance at SNR = 15 dB and surpasses the performance of low-order modulation. This is because high-order modulation allows the transmission of more semantic information, especially in high SNR regimes.</p>

Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-B Performance of SimHARQ-I ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Semantic Communication for Cooperative Perception using HARQ" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>(b) delineates a distinct plateau in performance enhancement beyond an SNR of 15 dB for SimHARQ-I, suggesting the SimHARQ-I is not particularly useful under conditions of high SNR regimes. In high SNR scenarios, most of the first transmissions are semantically accurate due to the significant reduction of semantic errors, resulting in minimal gain from HARQ. For all baseline schemes, significant semantic errors from channel noise render HARQ-I ineffective in the low SNR scenarios. In the moderate SNR scenarios, there is an approximate 3 dB gain while in high SNR scenarios, there is no gain. Across all SNRs, SimHARQ-I maintains a
better performance than the conventional methods, thereby demonstrating not only the efficacy of the proposed JSCC methods but also its enhanced robustness combined with HARQ protocols.</p>

In this paper, throughput is defined as the ratio of the number of successful transmissions to the total number of transmissions. It shows that the lower-order modulation scheme, LDPC-16QAM-HARQ, achieves a throughput of 1 at a lower SNR compared to higher-order schemes, such as LDPC-256QAM-HARQ. This efficiency is due to the superior error correction capabilities of lower-order modulations, enabling nearly error-free transmission at SNRs as low as 9 dB. Although the throughput of SimHARQ-I is lower than that of lower-order modulation schemes at the low SNRs, our scheme significantly surpasses traditional schemes in AP performance. Moreover, compared to the traditional higher-order modulation schemes, our scheme exhibits outstanding throughput performance under low SNR conditions, surpassing these traditional approaches. This highlights that our scheme, while maintaining communication efficiency, can also ensure high data transmission quality under complex channel conditions, especially in low SNR environments, indicative of the effective employment of the semantic error correction strategy, SimCRC.</p>

For instance, the performance at 9 dB with HARQ-II nearly matches the performance at 15 dB without HARQ, highlighting the efficiency of the retransmission process. Similarly, Fig. <a href="#S4.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ IV-C Performance of SimHARQ-II ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Semantic Communication for Cooperative Perception using HARQ" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(a) for AP@0.5 also indicates a remarkable gain due to the SimHARQ-II implementation in our method. The gain is around 6 dB, analogous to the improvement in the traditional scheme. This is illustrated by the fact that the performance at 6 dB with HARQ is comparably close to the performance at 12 dB, underscoring the effectiveness of SimHARQ-II in boosting system reliability even at lower SNR levels. When considering the AP@0.7 depicted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ IV-C Performance of SimHARQ-II ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Semantic Communication for Cooperative Perception using HARQ" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(b), the benefit of SimHARQ-II appears to be slightly less pronounced, yet still significant. Therefore, while SimHARQ-II contributes to enhancing performance, the extent of improvement may vary across different AP thresholds. It suggests that for higher AP thresholds, the system may require additional retransmissions to achieve similar gains. Furthermore, it is important to note that our proposed method consistently outperforms the traditional communication system across the entire SNR regimes. This superior performance suggests that our method benefits significantly not only from the utilization of HARQ but also from the employment of JSCC.</p>

For instance, at an SNR of 9 dB, both methods achieve similar performance in terms of AP@<math id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.7" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0.7</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><cn type="float" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1">0.7</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">0.7</annotation></semantics></math>, however, our proposed method demonstrates superior throughput, suggesting enhanced efficiency.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have introduced a novel JSCC framework combined with HARQ specifically designed for the transmission and intermediate fusion of LiDAR point clouds over wireless channels. This architecture features a semantic encoder that directly translates the input LiDAR point clouds into channel inputs, employing CNNs for both encoding and decoding functions. These CNNs are trained in the end-to-end manner, focusing on minimizing both the cooperative perception and reconstruction losses to optimize performance. To address the critical need for reliable transmission, particularly in environments with low SNR, we have developed a novel semantic error detection method, which significantly boosts transmission reliability when paired with our semantic communication framework and HARQ. Our simulation results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our model over traditional separate source-channel coding techniques in terms of perception performance, affirming the robustness of our system with or without HARQ implementation. Moreover, our proposed HARQ strategies showcase remarkable efficiency in throughput, outperforming conventional coding methods and highlighting the overall effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>
