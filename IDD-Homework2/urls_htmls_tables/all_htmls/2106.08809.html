<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, the deployment of federated learning (FL) is investigated in an energy harvesting wireless network in which the base station (BS) employs massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to serve a set of users powered by independent energy harvesting sources. Since a certain number of users may not be able to participate in FL due to the interference and energy constraints, a joint energy management and user scheduling problem in FL over wireless systems is formulated. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the FL training loss via optimizing user scheduling. To find how the factors such as transmit power and number of scheduled users affect the training loss, the convergence rate of the FL algorithm is first analyzed. Given this analytical result, the user scheduling and energy management optimization problem can be decomposed, simplified, and solved. Further, the system model is extended by considering multiple BSs. Hence, a joint user association and scheduling problem in FL over wireless systems is studied. The optimal user association problem is solved using the branch-and-bound technique. Simulation results show that the proposed user scheduling and user association algorithm can reduce training loss compared to a standard FL algorithm.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool that will play a critical role in designing and optimizing 6G architectures, protocols, and operations. In particular, ML enables future networks to support new costly services such as autonomous driving, enhanced mobile broadband, ultra reliable and low-latency communications, and intelligently manage wireless resource and devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, centralized ML techniques are becoming increasingly costly, due to the increased amount of data collected through wireless edge users, the limited power and bandwidth available, and privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) allows devices to train ML models without data transmission. This is done by having each edge user train and build its own ML model and send its trained ML model parameters to a central data center for aggregation so as to generate a shared ML model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The aggregated model parameters are then sent to the edge users for updating their individual ML models. This procedure is repeated in several communication rounds until achieving an acceptable accuracy of the trained model. Since all data is kept on the edge users, FL can also improve data privacy and security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The applicability of FL to edge computing and caching networks has been demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> where FL allows prediction of content popularity based on user-content interaction. However, the implementation of FL is challenging in wireless networks, due to multiuser interference, energy constraints, and heterogeneity of the users in terms of data model and hardware, such as CPU and memory. Moreover, since a massive number of edge users will potentially participate in FL and the wireless bandwidth is limited, communication is a critical bottleneck in FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Thus, to deploy FL over wireless networks, the problem of resource allocation (i.e. user scheduling, resource block allocation, power allocation, and bandwidth splitting) must be addressed.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, several techniques have been proposed to overcome issues in FL systems such as local updating and model compression. The impact of wireless channel randomness on the FL performance was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> where the authors proposed a novel efficient transmission method based on gradient sparsification. Moreover, the impact of noise on the FL loss function was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and a robust transmission scheme was proposed to eliminate the effect of noise. The incorporation of FL into a more sophisticated wireless system based on cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) was considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and a transmission scheme was developed to optimize FL performance. A number of existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> have studied user scheduling in FL over wireless networks under various assumptions and network architectures. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> investigated various user scheduling policies to enhance FL performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the authors investigated the problem of user selection in FL over wireless systems and proposed an efficient user scheduling scheme under wireless resource constraints. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> minimized the convergence time of FL by designing an appropriate user selection scheme. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the access probabilities of users were optimized for given local updates considering a multichannel random access. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the authors optimized user selection in FL training in order to avoid collisions and to minimize transmission failures. An efficient data sampling and user selection algorithm was designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> to enhance FL performance in mobile computing systems. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> overcame the issue of imbalanced data in FL over mobile systems by proposing an adaptive user scheduling and data augmentation algorithm. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, a joint user scheduling and resource block allocation scheme was proposed to minimize the FL training loss over wireless systems assuming imperfect channel state information (CSI). In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, an optimal user selection scheme was proposed to minimize the FL convergence rate. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the authors discussed the reliability of FL performance where only a subset of users are selected to eliminate the impact of unreliable users, thereby improving the FL training accuracy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a user selection scheme to mitigate the straggler effect for FL in cell-free massive MIMO systems.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The energy efficiency of FL over wireless networks has been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In particular, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> studied the energy efficiency of FL while considering limited energy budgets of wireless users and proposed an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. Meanwhile, power allocation among users was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> by considering federated cooperation to enhance FL performance. An energy-efficient bandwidth allocation and scheduling algorithm was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> to reduce energy consumption of users in FL over wireless networks. In addition, a wireless FL framework was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> by formulating an optimization problem that captures the trade-off between communication and computation latencies, and a closed-form optimal solution was derived. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the authors analyzed the trade-off between local updates and global updates in terms of convergence time by proposing an efficient control algorithm. Further, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> proposed an efficient algorithm that optimizes the convergence rate of FL under a total training time budget. The fairness in terms of comparable performance across the users in FL over wireless networks was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> by proposing data importance aware resource management schemes. FL is also studied for optimizing wireless network performance. In particular in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, FL is used to estimate distribution of the queue lengths in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based wireless networks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, a selective model aggregation algorithm was proposed to enhance the accuracy of FL over UAVs wireless networks. However, implementing FL over distributed users increases the power consumption of users. Most of these existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> did not consider the use of energy harvesting for the implementation of FL. Powering the devices by energy harvesting sources allows them to continually acquire energy from nature or man-made phenomena (e.g., solar, wind, and electromagnetic energy). In particular, each device can use the harvested energy for FL parameter update and transmission thus increasing the number of devices that can participate in FL and improving FL convergence time and training loss.

The BS uses the channel estimation method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> for massive MIMO. In particular, the devices send pilot signals with their energy levels to the BS which estimates the channel on the uplink using minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation. Due to the channel reciprocity in time division duplex (TDD), the channel in the downlink is considered similar to uplink.</p>

As expected, the average number of scheduled users is lower when the QoS constraints are more stringent. It can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Federated Learning over Energy Harvesting Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> that the proposed user scheduling algorithm can increase the number of devices that participate in FL by up to 100% at 5 dB and 50% at 40 dB compared to the round robin algorithm. The performance gap between decreases for high SINR threshold because the impact of interference is major. The enhanced performance is due to the efficient management of the harvested energy and deactivating the users that require a large amount of energy.</p>

A two-class classification task to recognize digits 0 and 8 for each UE with 2 training samples from the MNIST dataset, is considered. This ML model is tested every 10 communications rounds over 100 test samples with a learning rate 0.00001. The results are averaged over five Monte Carlo simulations. A successful global aggregation is defined as when a set of users successfully transmit their local wights to the BS by meeting the SINR and energy requirements and the BS is able to aggregate the received wights. It is clear that the optimal user scheduling algorithm enhances the FL performance in terms of accuracy compared to the random and round-robin scheduling, since it increases the successful global aggregations. This mainly is due to fact that optimal scheduling algorithm can tackle more efficiently the interference and energy constraints. The proposed FL achieving only 93% accuracy instead of 100% accuracy implies that the proposed FL cannot correctly identify all the handwritten digits. The identification errors are caused by the FL model, FL training method, and FL training datasets, which are not optimized by the proposed FL. Our purpose is to minimize the training loss instead of reducing training loss to 0. Therefore, the accuracy may be smaller than 100%. In fact, 100% accuracy is rarely achieved by any ML model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>

We consider CNN with 3 layers and 8 filters each followed by a dense layer of 16 neurons. Similar to the first experiment, a two-class classification task to recognize digits 0 and 8 for each UE with 10 training samples from the MNIST dataset, is considered. This ML model is tested every 10 communications rounds over 100 test samples with a learning rate 0.00006. The optimal scheduling algorithm converges faster than the random and round-robin schemes due to the efficient management of energy and interference. The proposed algorithm reaches a steady state in 100 training steps. However, it requires 150 training steps for the conventional FL systems to reach the steady state. The proposed algorithm increases the number of successful global aggregations. However, the performance gap disappears after a certain number of communications rounds since the difference in terms of successful aggregations is limited when the number of devices is small.

It is can be seen that the average number of scheduled users is lower when the QoS constraints are more stringent. Also, the optimal user association allows to admit more links compared to the random user association. The performance gap between the two user association schemes increases for high SINR threshold due to the efficient management of the harvested energy and interference.

It is clear that the number of scheduled users increases when the energy arrival rate increases. However, the performance tends to saturate for the random association scheme due to interference.

A two-class classification task to recognize digits 0 and 8 for each UE with 2 training samples from the MNIST dataset, is considered. This ML model is tested every 10 communications rounds over 100 test samples with a learning rate 0.00001. It is clear that the optimal user association enhances the FL performance in terms of accuracy compared to random association, since it increases the successful global aggregations. This mainly is due to fact that optimal user association scheme can tackle more efficiently the interference and energy constraints.</p>

<p id="S6.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Also, the multiple BS system is investigated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Federated Learning over Energy Harvesting Wireless Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> and the effect of user association schemes on FL performance is shown assuming CNN. A two-class classification task to recognize digits 0 and 8 for each UE with 10 training samples from the MNIST dataset, is considered. This ML model is tested every 10 communications rounds over 100 test samples with a learning rate 0.00006. It is clear that the proposed user association scheme in FL over wireless systems allows to increase the total number of aggregations which allows to enhance the FL performance in terms of accuracy and time convergence. The optimal user association algorithm converges faster than the random scheme due to the efficient management of energy and interference.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has investigated an energy-efficient FL over wireless system by equipping the BS with massive MIMO and powering the users by harvested energy sources. A minimization problem involving a global loss function subject to a quality of service constraint per user and energy availability constraints, has been formulated. We have investigated the impact of wireless parameters on Fl performance and derived the relationship between the FL convergence rate and user scheduling. The optimal user scheduling that minimizes the FL convergence rate is derived. Moreover, the multiple BSs case has been investigated by optimizing the optimal user association in FL over wireless systems using branch and bound.</p>
