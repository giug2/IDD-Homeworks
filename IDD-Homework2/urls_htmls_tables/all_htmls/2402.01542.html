<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, rare events, such as protein folding, are typically studied by means of enhanced sampling techniques, most of which rely on the definition of a collective variable (CV) along which the acceleration occurs.
Obtaining an expressive CV is crucial, but often hindered by the lack of information about the particular event, e.g., the transition from unfolded to folded conformation.
We propose a simulation-free data augmentation strategy using physics-inspired metrics to generate geodesic interpolations resembling protein folding transitions, thereby improving sampling efficiency without true transition state samples.
Leveraging interpolation progress parameters, we introduce a regression-based learning scheme for CV models, which outperforms classifier-based methods when transition state data is limited and noisy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a powerful tool to study the complex behavior of molecular systems.
However, despite their utility, MD simulations face significant challenges in efficiently exploring the vast conformational space of macromolecules and capturing rare events that occur on timescales beyond the reach of conventional simulation methods.
Rare events, such as protein folding, ligand binding, chemical reactions, and large-scale conformational changes, play pivotal roles in numerous biological and chemical phenomena <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chipot &amp; Pohorille, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>; Peters, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
These events often involve transitions between multiple metastable states separated by high free energy barriers, such that the timescales associated with rare events can be orders of magnitude longer than those accessible to standard MD simulations, rendering direct observation impractical within reasonable computational resources.
Consequently, accurately characterizing the kinetics and thermodynamics of such rare events remains an important challenge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To facilitate the efficient sampling of rare events, researchers have developed a diverse array of enhanced sampling techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hénin et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, which bias the simulations towards regions of interest or lower energy barriers.
These techniques can roughly be divided into two classes: one that focuses the sampling on transitions by manipulating the initial conditions and the other that introduces a bias term to the potential energy surface (PES).
In this work, we concentrate on the latter class of algorithms, which encompasses a broad spectrum of methodologies, including umbrella sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Torrie &amp; Valleau, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">1977</a>)</cite>, metadynamics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Laio &amp; Parrinello, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>)</cite>, and adaptive biasing force <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Darve &amp; Pohorille, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>; Comer et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.
All of them have in common that they require the selection of one or several collective variables (CVs), special degrees of freedom that describe the rare event of interest, such that biasing along these CVs will greatly accelerate the observation of the rare transitions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For small molecular systems, it is often possible to choose a CV based on chemical intuition, e.g., the distance between two atoms whose bond is broken or formed during a chemical reaction.
In contrast, when dealing with complex, high-dimensional systems, it is virtually impossible to choose a CV based on a physical basis.
As an example, the dissociation of table salt in water is insufficiently described by the sodium–chloride distance, as the surrounding water molecules play an important role <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Geissler et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
Here, data-driven approaches can be and have been leveraged to identify a coordinate amenable to enhanced sampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mendels et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Sultan &amp; Pande, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Bonati et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Sun et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Šípka et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
However, machine-learned models of CVs are data-hungry, and when fitted with insufficient data, they might fail to describe the transition dynamics.
Hence, we are faced with a chicken-and-egg problem; we need enough samples of the rare event in order to obtain good CV models that are required to perform enhanced sampling of said event.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To circumvent this problem, recent methods, such as Deep-TICA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonati et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and TPI-Deep-TDA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ray et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, adopt an iterative approach, where they first perform enhanced sampling with suboptimal CVs to collect initial trajectories, including a few transitions, and then use those samples to improve the CV.
While such methods have been proven to reduce the total simulation time required to obtain the target observable, the initial simulation for the data collection would have to be long enough to observe enough transitions.
In complex systems, this step alone could be too costly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To significantly reduce the computational cost of training effective CV models, we propose a strategy for simulation-free data augmentation.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Diepeveen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> proposed a physics-inspired metric to construct a Riemannian manifold for protein conformations.
We utilize this framework to generate geodesic interpolations, which resemble protein folding transitions remarkably well.
We show that augmenting training data with these interpolations improves the sampling even without the true transition state samples.
Another key advantage of these interpolations is that the interpolation parameter <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t\in[0,1]" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">∈</mo><mrow id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.2" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.2.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml">[</mo><mn id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.2.2" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.2" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.2.cmml">1</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.2.3" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.2b"><apply id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3"><in id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.1"></in><ci id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.2">𝑡</ci><interval closure="closed" id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.3.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">0</cn><cn type="integer" id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.2.2">1</cn></interval></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.2c">t\in[0,1]</annotation></semantics></math> represents the progress of the transition.
This opens the door to supervised learning of protein folding in a regression setting, providing the model with richer information compared to discriminant analysis-based methods.
Our experiments reveal that our regression model outperforms discriminant analysis when dealing with limited transition state samples from simulation.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the absence of information about the transition state ensemble (TSE), such data-driven CVs may not be optimal.
Accordingly, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Geodesic interpolation ‣ 2 Related Works ‣ Learning Collective Variables for Protein Folding with Labeled Data Augmentation through Geodesic Interpolation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, conventional practice often involves acquiring transition state samples through an iterative procedure by which the ML CV is refined.
Many data-driven CVs have been developed to integrate these transition samples into their design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Bonati et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Ray et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.</p>

This method shares a similar motivation with our interpolation parameter-based regression: providing the model with regression labels derived from proxies of transition progress rather than simple class labels can enhance the CV performance.
However, a drawback of this approach is its computational cost, as it requires multiple shooting simulations per data point to compute the committor probability.
Even a recent CV-free approach, as introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sípka et al.

Long and costly production runs are meaningful only when performed with a reliable CV (right).

The implication of the metric in eq. (<a href="#S3.E1" title="Equation 1 ‣ 3.1 Geodesic interpolation of protein conformations ‣ 3 Methods ‣ Learning Collective Variables for Protein Folding with Labeled Data Augmentation through Geodesic Interpolation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) is that a change in a small pairwise distance is more significant than a change of the same magnitude in a large pairwise distance.
In other words, a perturbation of the Euclidean distance between two atoms affects the distance on the manifold more strongly when the atoms were originally close by.
This aligns with the physical intuition that the important interactions between the particles in a system are mostly local, and the perturbations in the interactions correspond to changes in the energy of the system.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Methods based on discriminant analysis rely heavily on accurately assigning samples to their respective states, as the loss functions are tailored to maximize the differentiation between these states.
As reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ray et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, training the CV model with reduced overlap between states can significantly enhance its performance.
However, in situations where our understanding of the system is limited, distinguishing samples from the metastable states and those from the TSE becomes challenging.
This overlap between states can impede the effectiveness of enhanced sampling techniques, as accurate state predictions are crucial for discriminatory methods, which can be measured by their convergence to the correct reaction free energy value.

WTM-eABF enhances the sampling along the chosen CV by effectively flattening the energy landscape with the combination of the extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>) and well-tempered metadynamics (WTM, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Barducci et al. (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>).
In ABF, the negative running estimate of average force along the CV is applied to adaptively shear off the barrier, while in WTM, the adaptive potential is stacked along the CV to fill up the energy landscape to the barrier level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chipot, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
We evaluate the performance of our ML-CVs by analyzing the convergence of the estimated reaction free energy of folding and the resulting PMF.</p>

The intermediate structures generated using geodesic interpolation smoothly interpolate between the unfolded and folded structures, with a close resemblance to the unbiased reference trajectory over simulation time, as visually described in Fig <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.4 Leveraging the interpolation parameter as an indicator of reaction progress ‣ 3 Methods ‣ Learning Collective Variables for Protein Folding with Labeled Data Augmentation through Geodesic Interpolation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a).
The donor–acceptor distances of the two key hydrogen bonds between Asp3–Thr6 and Asp3–Thr8 are also smoothly interpolated, following the trend of those from the unbiased trajectory (Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.4 Leveraging the interpolation parameter as an indicator of reaction progress ‣ 3 Methods ‣ Learning Collective Variables for Protein Folding with Labeled Data Augmentation through Geodesic Interpolation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(b)).</p>

Where principal component analysis (PCA) returns eigenvectors that are linear combinations of the input features that maximize the corresponding variance, TICA returns the combinations with the slowest motions.
The first component of TICA represents the slowest collective motions of the chignolin system, capturing the unfolded–folded transition, and the second component resolves the three clusters in the folded state.

This consistency indicates that all of our trained CVs can correctly distinguish between the unfolded and folded equilibrium conformations in the reference trajectory.
Additionally, we classified the conformations into folded, transition, and unfolded states based on the number of hydrogen bonds characteristic of the folded state, as detailed in Appendix <a href="#A4" title="Appendix D Structural analysis ‣ Learning Collective Variables for Protein Folding with Labeled Data Augmentation through Geodesic Interpolation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">D</span></a>.

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This enhancement in performance from the data augmentation can be attributed to the CV model’s ability to generalize its classification ability to off-equilibrium conformations observed in the enhanced sampling runs and accurately identify the transition progress.
This is evident in the CV projections of conformations from the WTM-eABF runs shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Data augmentation improves ML CV ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Learning Collective Variables for Protein Folding with Labeled Data Augmentation through Geodesic Interpolation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(b).

It is notable that all of the CV models correctly identify the states of the equilibrium conformations, while the results for off-equilibrium conformations show a large discrepancy according to the training data.
This underscores the importance of ensuring robustness to out-of-distribution configurations through training with data augmented with TSE structures, which is efficiently achieved by the interpolation scheme in this work.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By leveraging geodesic interpolations to generate a synthetic transition state ensemble (TSE), we demonstrate notable improvements in enhanced sampling simulations when compared to the existing methods trained solely on metastable state conformations.
Our results highlight the importance of incorporating transition state information into the training of collective variable (CV) models.
This integration not only enhances the ability to distinguish between the metastable states accurately, but also enables to effectively capture the underlying dynamics of the system, as evidenced by the change in a number of hydrogen bonds along the CV axis. We expect this method to be applicable to a wide range of rare events, from protein folding to chemical reactions.</p>

The simulations were performed in the NVT ensemble with the velocity rescaling thermostat at 340 K, and integrated with the leap-frog algorithm with a time step of 2 fs.
The LINCS algorithm was used to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms.
Four independent initial configurations were prepared by sampling four different unfolded chignolin coordinates from the reference simulation and equilibrating the system for 10 ps.</p>

However, the model hyperparameters did not significantly affect the accuracy of the regression task. Given that all models are simple MLP models, variations in hyperparameter settings are not expected to yield substantial changes in results. Max number of epochs was set to 800. We divided the datasets into training and validation sets with an 80:20 ratio.</p>

<p id="A4.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In addition to time-lagged independent compontent analysis, we devised a structure-based method to classify conformations into folded, transition, and unfolded states.
We collected eight distinctive hydrogen bonds observed in the folded state, Tyr1:N–Tyr10:OT1, Tyr1:N–Tyr10:OT2, Asp3:N–Tyr8:O, Thr6:OG1–Asp3:O, Thr6:N–Asp3:OD1, Thr6:N–Asp3:OD2, Gly7:N–Asp3:O, and Tyr10:N–Tyr1:O, as depicted in Figure <a href="#A4.F1" title="Figure D.1 ‣ Appendix D Structural analysis ‣ Learning Collective Variables for Protein Folding with Labeled Data Augmentation through Geodesic Interpolation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">D.1</span></a>(b).
The hydrogen bonds are detected in the conformation based on the two criteria: (1) acceptor and donor atom distance within 3.5 Å and (2) acceptor–hydrogen–donor angle larger than 110<sup id="A4.SS1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_sup">∘</sup>.

The transition from the unfolded to the folded state consist of the simultaneous formation of these two structural features, suggesting a classification threshold of two hydrogen bonds.
The projection of conformations from the reference trajectory onto the slowest modes (Figure <a href="#A4.F1" title="Figure D.1 ‣ Appendix D Structural analysis ‣ Learning Collective Variables for Protein Folding with Labeled Data Augmentation through Geodesic Interpolation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">D.1</span></a>(a)) validates that the two metastable states can be distinguished based on the number of hydrogen bonds, with the transition region along TIC 1 aligning with the two hydrogen bonds.</p>
