<p id="id17.id1" class="ltx_p">Our research investigates the challenges Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) faces in complex, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) such as autonomous driving (AD), and proposes a solution for vision-based navigation in these environments. Partial observability reduces RL performance significantly, and this can be mitigated by augmenting sensor information and data fusion to reflect a more Markovian environment. However, this necessitates an increasingly complex perception module, whose training via RL is complicated due to inherent limitations. As the neural network architecture becomes more complex, the reward function’s effectiveness as an error signal diminishes since the only source of supervision is the reward, which is often noisy, sparse, and delayed. Task-irrelevant elements in images, such as the sky or certain objects, pose additional complexities.
Our research adopts an offline-trained encoder to leverage large video datasets through self-supervised learning to learn generalizable representations.
Then, we train a head network on top of these representations through DRL to learn to control an ego vehicle in the CARLA AD simulator.
This study presents a broad investigation of the impact of different learning schemes for offline-training of encoders on the performance of DRL agents in challenging AD tasks.
Furthermore, we show that the features learned by watching BDD100K driving videos can be directly transferred to achieve lane following and collision avoidance in CARLA simulator, in a zero-shot learning fashion.
Finally, we explore the impact of various architectural decisions for the RL networks to utilize the transferred representations efficiently.
Therefore, in this work, we introduce and validate an optimal way for obtaining suitable representations of the environment, and transferring them to RL networks.
We experimentally demonstrate the correlation between RL performance in the CARLA simulator and the quality of representations received by the RL agent. These results highlight the crucial role that feature extraction and state representation play in RL.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_font_smallcaps ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the domain of artificial intelligence, vision-based methods have arisen as a pivotal area of exploration. Leveraging camera images as primary inputs offers a versatile and cost-effective way to obtain a nuanced understanding of an environment by capturing colors, dimensions, and spatial orientation of objects. The recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision accentuate the capabilities of cameras, suggesting a potential reduction in reliance on expensive sensors like LiDAR.
However, the journey to achieve autonomy still faces numerous challenges. Autonomous driving operates primarily within the boundaries of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), where only a part of the environmental state is observed, called belief state. In an attempt to reduce the uncertainty in the belief state, historical information, sensor augmentation and data fusion methods are utilized.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While it has been shown that this uncertainty is reduced when more information is added, it also poses several new problems.
The use of diverse sensors and their associated data fusion techniques amplify the complexity of the perception module. Hence, cutting-edge learning algorithms, datasets, and hardware solutions tailored for deep neural networks (DNN) and high-dimensional data streams are required.
This progression of complexity inevitably raises critical questions about the applicability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in real-world AD scenarios.
End-to-end RL methods suffer from low sampling efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> , which is especially critical for AD. High-resolution sensors produce vast amounts of data every second <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, necessitating semantic processing at various layers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The data often has spatiotemporal correlations that are essential to capture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we address the challenges arising from the limitations of reward-driven representation learning of spatiotemporal input data for AD using DRL. We investigate the effects of various learning schemes for the offline-training of encoders for spatiotemporal representation learning, and the performance of RL agents with the transferred representations for AD, as depicted in Figure <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ An Examination of Offline-Trained Encoders in Vision-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Our experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity simulator CARLA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, where RL agents control ego vehicles to achieve lane following and collision avoidance tasks.</p>

<div id="Sx1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we investigate the significance of encoder representations for reinforcement learning for autonomous driving. Our first comprehensive ablation study aims to find the most suitable architectural design for the encoder’s head, actor, and critic neural network. This careful exploration provides the foundation to ensure an optimal representation transfer, which is crucial for enhancing the performance.
Following this, we conducted a broad investigation of representation learning algorithms suitable for the offline-training of the encoder. For this purpose, we compared a variety of self-supervised learning approaches to learn from videos.
In this comparison, we used a generative model: variational autoencoder (VAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, three joint embedding architectures: Momentum Contrast (MoCo) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and Dense Predictive Coding (DPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, where both utilize a contrastive loss, and Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> with a non-contrastive loss.
As an additional comparison, we incorporated YOLOPv2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> for panoptic driving perception to compare representations trained for multiple perception tasks in a supervised manner with self-supervised learning representations on DRL performance.
We show that self-supervised representations learned by watching BDD100K driving videos can be transferred to CARLA driving simulator with no fine-tuning required.
Ultimately, this research points out how large video datasets can be leveraged to obtain encoded representations suitable learning to control an ego vehicle through DRL in a high-fidelity driving simulator.</p>

<div id="Sx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the sample-efficiency of RL and learn latent dynamics, several works employ variational autoencoders (VAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> applied to Google DeepMind infrastructure for physics-based simulation (DMControl) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, to tackle challenges in reward-driven, vision-based RL, several methodologies have adopted offline-trained encoders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, which use contrastive learning for training the encoders, and evaluated in DMControl tasks.
Yuan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> employ earlier layers of a pre-trained image encoder trained on ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> through supervision, and
DMControl and CARLA. However, in this work we compare a variety of video encoders trained through contrastive, non-contrastive and generative models without any labels, and evaluate their performances on CARLA.
Additionally, Feichtenhofer et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> compare MoCo and BYOL for spatiotemporal representation learning for downstream computer vision tasks, where we compare them for control tasks in CARLA, and additionally employ a variational autoencoder as a generative model and another contrastive model, DPC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> for a more diverse investigation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct our study in the the hyper-realistic environments presented by CARLA driving simulator, aiming to address real-world autonomous driving tasks.
While earlier studies utilized vision-based RL methods in challenging environments, their visual data often lack the depth and complexity of real-world conditions. Real-world scenarios introduce nuances such as fluctuating weather, unpredictable pedestrian behavior, dynamic traffic, and occlusions, all with partial observability.
The works of Toromanoff et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and Carton et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> leverage monocular cameras within CARLA, similar to us, to solve autonomous driving tasks by using imitation learning and highly informative reward functions. However, in this work, we do not use imitation learning and use a highly sparse and challenging reward function that offers less granular information to allow our agent to adapt to difficult situations, and generalize better. Additionally, we assess the performance implications of different learning schemes to offline-train encoders and architectural design decisions.</p>

<div id="Sx3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our methodology can be splitted into three major components: offline-trained encoder, head network and DRL model.
First we train an encoder to learn generalizable features from an offline video dataset to be transferred to our DRL model. This encoder is trained offline based on various state of the art algorithms from computer vision.
Then, the representation of the encoder is used for decoupled DRL to learn to control a vehicle in a driving simulator.
Finally, we perform an ablation study for designing the head network to transfer the learned representations optimally for vision-based navigation.</p>

BYOL uses a similarity loss, a simple mean square error (MSE) between the representations of the query encoder <math id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q_{\theta}(z_{\theta})" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">q</mi><mi id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">θ</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><msub id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">z</mi><mi id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">θ</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"></times><apply id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑞</ci><ci id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝜃</ci></apply><apply id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑧</ci><ci id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝜃</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.m1.1c">q_{\theta}(z_{\theta})</annotation></semantics></math> and the key encoder <math id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="z^{\prime}_{\xi}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1a"><msubsup id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">z</mi><mi id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">ξ</mi><mo id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">′</mo></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><apply id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝑧</ci><ci id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3">′</ci></apply><ci id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">𝜉</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p1.2.m2.1c">z^{\prime}_{\xi}</annotation></semantics></math>, as shown in Equation <a href="#Sx3.E2" title="In Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) ‣ 1.

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To apply MoCo and BYOL for video, we used their adaptations to spatiotemporal representation learning, through 3D convolutions and an additional temporal persistency objective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, so that the clips from the same video have similar embeddings, and the clips from different videos have distant embeddings. Furthermore, MoCo and BYOL utilize a momentum encoder, whose weights are a moving averages of the original encoder.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">DPC learns representations by recurrently predicting future representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Similar to MoCo, DPC is a contrastive learning approach, utilizing the InfoNCE loss (Eq. <a href="#Sx3.E1" title="In Momentum Contrast (MoCo) ‣ 1. Offline-trained Encoder ‣ Methodology ‣ An Examination of Offline-Trained Encoders in Vision-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
However, DPC differs from MoCo by not utilizing a momentum encoder, but aggregating the predicted representations over the temporal axis using recurrent neural networks.
Hence, it implicitly enforces a temporal coherence to learn the inherent temporal dynamics of the data.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.SSS0.Px4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A VAE consists of two main components: an encoder, which maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent space, and a decoder, which reconstructs the input data from the latent representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
While the reconstruction loss encourages compact and efficient encoding of the input data, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term pushes the learned latent variables to adhere to a known distribution, enabling smoother interpolation and generalization in the latent space, as in Equation <a href="#Sx3.E3" title="In Variational Autoencoder (VAE) ‣ 1. Offline-trained Encoder ‣ Methodology ‣ An Examination of Offline-Trained Encoders in Vision-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. To make the autoencoder comparable to the other approaches used in this work, we adapted it to take a sequence of four input images.
In contrary to MoCo, BYOL and DPC, which are joint embedding architectures, VAE is a generative model, which learns the representations with a reconstruction objective.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For this study, we adapted our existing DRL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and used it for the validation of our encoders for vision-based navigation in CARLA driving simulator.

The framework consists of three main modules: environment, leaderboard, and DRL framework. CARLA leaderboard standardizes traffic scenario definitions and provides a benchmark to compare the performance of different approaches. We integrate the offline trained encoders and implement an additional head network to predict vehicle controls into our DRL framework so that the RL agent can learn higher-level decision-making and control policies from visual abstractions rather than learning multiple perception tasks.
By freezing the encoder layers, we prevent them from being trained by the RL loss function, resulting in a visual abstraction, i.e., representation learning based RL training configuration. This configuration trains only the actor and critic NNs with RL loss and uses representations as inputs <math id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">s</mi><mi id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑠</ci><ci id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SSx2.p1.1.m1.1c">s_{t}</annotation></semantics></math> from the frozen encoder module.

<p id="Sx3.SSx2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conducted experiments in CARLA focusing on lane following and collision avoidance. The evaluation was limited exclusively to the steering control of an ego vehicle, with acceleration control taken over by the autopilot. This approach was chosen because learning acceleration control requires additional information, such as variable speed limits on different road types. In addition, successful acceleration control would place increased demands on NN, particularly regarding data fusion within the networks and adaptation of input data. These additional requirements could change the nature of our ablation study and complicate the investigation of the impacts of different offline encoders.

Notably, most RL trainings with offline-trained encoders succeeded in the task, with DPC being an exception. The DRL training of the head network with DPC as the encoder failed to converge, consistently committing lane invasions even beyond 1800 episodes. A successful driving behavior requires zero lane invasions and zero collisions to achieve the maximum possible reward, which is zero. The VAE encoder exhibited this, albeit with better convergence than DPC. MoCo and BYOL succeeded in the task, demonstrating a consistent driving behavior. Their primary distinction was in convergence speed: BYOL reached zero rewards in just 700 episodes, while MoCo took 850 episodes. Due to its supervised and multi-task learning scheme, and more complex E-ELAN backbone, YOLOPv2 encoder showed a faster convergence and reached a reward of zero in merely 500 episodes, as expected. However, BYOL is a close second, which shows the strength of BYOL representations, even though trained without labels and with a smaller backbone, 3D-ResNet18.

End-to-end RL fails at the lane following and collision avoidance tasks, and thus, can only reach a reward of -4. In contrast, our BYOL encoder with a trained head network not only learns an effective policy but also attains zero rewards after approximately 700 episodes, which indicates of a flawless driving behavior without any lane violations or collisions, as shown by Figures <a href="#Sx3.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ Temporal Axis Reduction ‣ 3.

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we examine multiple self-supervised spatiotemporal representation learning approaches to train an encoder for AD using DRL. We train our encoders on the BDD100K driving dataset, and design a head network on top of these encoders to predict vehicle controls in CARLA driving simulator. Then, we train the head network through DRL to learn the lane following and collision avoidance tasks.
Our experiment results showed that learning by reconstruction produces weaker features for perception as also shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, joint embedding architectures learned stronger features, which are also useful for control tasks.
As our non-contrastive approach, BYOL was the best performing SSL approach, we believe contrastive learning can be harmful to learned representations, as some videos in the dataset can be still similar to each other, hence, include similar features. However, contrastive learning pushes these embeddings away from each other.
Furthermore, even though Transformer-based approaches proved their strength in vision tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>
we show that a relatively lightweight ConvNet, such as a 3D-ResNet18 can capture useful features from a sequence of frames that can be useful for control.
Our investigation for designing the head network showed that when the representation quality is high such as the encoder trained by BYOL, the impact of the design of the head network is less significant. However, with lower representation quality, such as the encoder trained by DPC, the design of the head network is important for succeeding in the control task.
Finally, self-supervised learning can learn generalizable features that can be transferred from the BDD100K dataset to CARLA simulator without further fine-tuning, which proves the scalability of SSL to utilize large video datasets.</p>
