<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that trains a global model for prediction based on several local models at clients while local data privacy is preserved.
Class imbalance is believed to be one of the factors that degrades the global model performance.
However, there has been very little research on if and how class imbalance can affect the global performance in various imbalance scenarios.
Class imbalance in federated learning is much more complex than that in traditional non-distributed machine learning, due to different class imbalance situations at local clients.
Class imbalance needs to be re-defined in distributed learning environments, so that corresponding solutions can be proposed.
In this paper, first, we propose two new metrics to define class imbalance – the global class imbalance degree (MID) and the local difference of class imbalance among clients (WCS).
Class imbalance is categorized into four scenarios under the definition.
Then, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of class imbalance on the global performance in various scenarios.
Our results show that a higher MID and a larger WCS degrade more the performance of the global model.
Besides, WCS is shown to slow down the convergence of the global model by misdirecting the optimization.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As the rapid development of advanced computing hardware and machine learning algorithms, edge computing and ubiquitous computing systems have sprung forth. Local devices, such as mobile phones and wearable devices, have become a major source of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. A large number of devices are interconnected and are equipped with sensors that constantly generate potentially useful data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To learn from such data, local data from clients have to be gathered together. However, these local generated data tend to contain sensitive information, such as end users’ personal information and clients’ medical records. Transmitting data among devices directly can cause privacy leakage and security issues.
Traditional machine learning approaches that collect and centralize user data will become legally impossible. Federated learning was thus proposed to learn from data, protect data privacy and improve network security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning trains a global model at the central server based on a group of local models trained and maintained at the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Instead of transmitting data to the central server, only intermediate local model updates are communicated periodically with the server. In each round of training, the central server selects a group of clients and broadcasts the current global model to them. Then, the selected clients train the received model using their local data and feedback the model updates to the server. Lastly, the central server aggregates the updates from the clients. This iterative training process continues across the network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is able to make use of local data for training without violating privacy or breaking data island between clients. Currently, federated learning has been deployed by major service providers and plays a critical role in privacy-sensitive applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
While most research in federated learning focuses on reducing communication loads and protecting data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, little work has looked into how local data can affect the performance of the global model.
Data from different clients are always not independently and identically distributed (Non-IID). Class imbalance is a type of non-iid distributions in federated learning environments. In a classification task, such as fraudulent phone call detection and diagnoses of rare diseases, class imbalance refers to the situation where some classes of data (minority) are significantly under-represented compared to other classes (majority). In traditional non-distributed machine learning, class imbalance can cause great performance degradation, especially the poor accuracy on minority classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Class imbalance is also common in federated learning.
For example, in real-world health data, severe class imbalance is a norm, rather than an exception <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
However, it is unclear if and how local class imbalance in federated learning can affect the performance of the global model.
Compared with the traditional non-distributed learning case, class imbalance in federated learning is much more complex.
Local models and their regular updates could be affected by local imbalanced data, but it is unclear how many affected clients or how the severity of local imbalance may cause a global degradation.
Meanwhile, the class imbalance status between clients can vary.
For example, a client A has a minority class c1 and a majority class c2, but a client B has class c1 as majority and class c2 as minority.
Therefore, various class imbalance in federated learning should be categorised properly for potential solution to tackle them.
This paper aims at providing a full understanding of the impact of class imbalance in federated learning that will shed lights on suitable solutions of tackling class imbalance in federated learning.
We will answer three specific questions in this paper:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There is extensive investigation into class imbalance in non-distributed machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The impact of class imbalance depends on the imbalance level, concept complexity and size of training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Lack of information caused by small sample size, class overlapping, and small disjuncts within class are main reasons of class imbalance causing performance degradation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To tackle different types of class imbalance, the traditional approaches can be classified into five groups – sampling approaches, re-weighting approaches, feature selection, one class learning, cost-sensitive learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and ensemble learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The nature of federated learning makes it different from non-distributed machine learning when dealing with class imbalance. In federated leaning, class imbalance presented at local data may or may not result in global class imbalance when the central server aggregates the model updates. Therefore, we need to separately define and discuss local class imbalance and global class imbalance. Furthermore, the local and global class imbalance can be totally different <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. A majority class at some clients can be the minority class at the global level, and vice versa. The privacy protection of federated learning further increases the difficulty of estimating the class imbalance degree at the central server. As a result, existing class imbalance mitigating approaches can be only used locally, which may not help with global performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A few very recent papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> have noticed the negative impact of class imbalance in federated learning and proposed techniques to tackle it.
<span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed-Focal Loss</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> used a modified loss function that down-weights the loss of well-classified samples based on Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) Loss. By doing so, the majority class with a larger number of examples contributes less to the model when it reaches high prediction accuracy. Correspondingly, the minority-class samples contribute more to the local model.
<span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Astraea</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> added mediators between the central server and clients to re-balance the datasets. Imbalanced clients are rearranged to different balance mediators according to their imbalance levels and label distributions. Within the mediator, the clients perform training sequentially on a single balanced dataset. Then, the mediators communicate with the central server in parallel as clients in original federated learning.
<span id="S2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Ratio Loss</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> employed a monitor scheme on the server to estimate local class imbalance without asking for label distributions. The monitoring scheme uses the relation between the gradient magnitude and the sample quantity to estimate global class imbalance at the server. Then, Ratio Loss based on BCE Loss is deployed at the local training process to strengthen the impact of minority-class examples.
Similarly, Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a local class imbalance estimator based on gradient magnitude. Then clients selection is used to achieve class balance globally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The aforementioned papers proposed new techniques to tackle class imbalance in specific setting, which shows the necessity of studying the class imbalance issue in federated learning.
However, they all treated a small part of class imbalance scenario as the full picture of class imbalance in federated learning.
Astraea was only valid with slightly global imbalance, while Ratio Loss can do nothing with a balanced global dataset consisted of imbalance local datasets.
Ratio Loss addressed the impact of mismatch between local and global imbalance, while the conclusion is drawn based on particular experiments setting without considering more general case with other imbalance degree.
In addition, Metrics used in those works include imbalance ratio, cosine similarity cannot fully reflect the imbalance states. Likelihood-ratio imbalanced degree (LRID) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> failed to measure the multiclass imbalance degree as well. The comparison between those metrics and ours will be discussed in Section <a href="#S3" title="III Class Imbalance Definition ‣ An Experimental Study of Class Imbalance in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.
This paper thus aims at an in-depth understanding of class imbalance in various federated learning scenarios, which will help to develop the most suitable solutions in the future.</p>

However, the similarity of global and local class imbalance should be nearly 1 as client2 contributes little to the global model. In this case, the small local dataset with extreme class imbalance leads to a biased estimation of the local and global imbalance relation when using MCS.
Therefore we propose Weighted Cosine Similarity (WCS) to measure the relationship between local and global imbalance that considers the contribution of local datasets.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigates the impact of class imbalance in federated learning. We focus on three research questions: Q1. define class imbalance in federated learning. Q2. explore the impact of global class imbalance on the global model. Q3. explore the impact of imbalance differences between local clients on the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For Q1, we proposed two new metrics – MID and WCS. MID measures the global class imbalance degree. It improves the traditional Imbalance Ratio and LRID, which is suitable to multi-class data and is insensitive to the size of datasets. WCS is specifically designed for federated learning that measures the class imbalance differences among local clients and considers the contributions of local datasets. Based on MID and WCS, we looked into 4 class imbalanced scenarios to answer Q2 and Q3. For Q2, we found that a larger MID leads to more significant degradation of the global performance in terms of prediction accuracy and F1-Score. For Q3, we showed that a large difference of class imbalance degree among local datasets not only reduces the global performance, but also slows down the convergence by introducing fluctuation in optimization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This work suggests that
1) class imbalance in federated learning should be studied separately considering MID and WCS,
2) global class imbalance should be studied and tackled appropriately in federated learning for better global model performance, and
3) the differences of local class imbalance should also be treated seriously that could affect the global performance and convergence speed.</p>
