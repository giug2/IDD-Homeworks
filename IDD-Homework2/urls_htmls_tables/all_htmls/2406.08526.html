<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that enables clients to collaboratively train a shared global model without uploading their local data. To alleviate the heterogeneous data quality among clients, artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) can be leveraged as a novel data synthesis technique for FL model performance enhancement. Due to various costs incurred by AIGC-empowered FL (e.g., costs of local model computation and data synthesis), however, clients are usually reluctant to participate in FL without adequate economic incentives, which leads to an unexplored critical issue for enabling AIGC-empowered FL. To fill this gap, we first devise a data quality assessment method for data samples generated by AIGC and rigorously analyze the convergence performance of FL model trained using a blend of authentic and AI-generated data samples. We then propose a data quality-aware incentive mechanism to encourage clients’ participation. In light of information asymmetry incurred by clients’ private multi-dimensional attributes, we investigate clients’ behavior patterns and derive the server’s optimal incentive strategies to minimize server’s cost in terms of both model accuracy loss and incentive payments for both complete and incomplete information scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism exhibits highest training accuracy and reduces up to <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="53.34\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">53.34</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">53.34</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">53.34\%</annotation></semantics></math> of the server’s cost with real-world datasets, compared with existing benchmark mechanisms.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fast proliferation of edge devices (e.g., mobile devices and wearable devices) in modern society has led to the rapid growth of data generated from massive distributed sources, which further promotes the advancement of a wide range of artificial intelligent applications (e.g., autonomous driving and healthcare) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, due to the increasing privacy concerns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and limited network bandwidth, the predominant mechanism that gathers extensive data from dispersed devices to the cloud for centralized model training becomes impractical. To reap the benefits of the scattered data without privacy risk, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has emerged as a promising paradigm that enables to collaboratively train a shared global model by aggregating locally-computed updates uploaded by clients (e.g., mobile devices). By decoupling model training from the need of direct access of the local data on the devices, FL realizes distributed and privacy-preserving model training.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, most existing FL frameworks usually make an optimistic assumption that clients participate in FL model training voluntarily and ignore the inevitable data-computing cost (e.g., battery and CPU resource consumption for local model updates) incurred by inevitable training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. While in reality, rational clients would be reluctant to participate in model training without sufficient economic compensation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
By paying rewards to compensate the cost of clients reasonably, incentive mechanism has garnered significant attention from researchers and become the essential financial catalyst for making FL a reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the promising benefits of privacy preservation, federated learning performance remains constrained in mobile application scenarios due to challenges such as non-IID (a.k.a. non independent and identically distributed) nature of data from scattered mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In certain mobile applications, such as autonomous vehicle training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and health monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the lack of specific labeled data further exacerbates this issue, as the characteristics of users’ datasets vary according to their activities.
To alleviate the issue of non-IID data distribution and data scarcity inherent in FL, the great explosion of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) service <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> has opened up a compelling avenue for the clients to generate high-quality data (e.g., images and videos) with generative AI techniques at a rapid pace.
For example, by leveraging generative adversarial networks, clients are able to collectively train a generative model to augment their local data towards yielding an IID dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Empowered with generative AI services (e.g., Stable Diffusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>), the learning performance of FL can be significantly improved by utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model to synthesize customized local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Consequently, integrating AIGC as a data synthesis tool at the client side can substantially improve data quality and enhance FL model performance in real-world applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the additional costs of data generation by AIGC service would mitigate clients’ willingnesses to participate in federated learning without sufficient economic compensation, thereby presenting new challenges to current incentive mechanisms which does not consider the complex clients’ behaviors on whether to adopt AIGC service <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
In light of potential benefits and challenges of using AIGC technique in the context of FL, it is non-trivial to devise efficient incentive mechanism for such a complicated AIGC-empowered FL scenario to encourage clients to contribute their data (e.g., local data or rectified data by AIGC service) and resources for FL model training while minimizing server’s own cost (e.g., payments for client recruiting, model accuracy loss, etc.). First, an indispensable preliminary step for effective incentive mechanism involves performance assessment of the final converged model prior to commencing FL model training. As the model performance is jointly influenced by many factors, i.e., the number of global training iterations, clients’ attributes including the quantity and quality of the local data, it is non-trivial to evaluate the final model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Moreover, the data quality changes resulted from clients’ adoption of AIGC service for data synthesis presents key challenges for model performance evaluation. Second, faced the temptation of being rewarded, clients may choose to generate a high-quality dataset by leveraging AIGC service (e.g., reaching IID dataset by replenishing data samples in minority classes) for local model updates, which may further affect the server’s decision-making regarding client recruitment, and hence make the design of optimal incentive strategy much more involved. Third, clients’ individual attributes (e.g., data quality and data-computing cost) also bring difficulty to the incentive mechanism design due to information asymmetry (i.e., such private client’s information may not be available to the server for decision making prior to the FL training process).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose a data quality-aware incentive mechanism in AIGC-empowered FL scenario. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ IMFL-AIGC: Incentive Mechanism Design for Federated Learning Empowered by Artificial Intelligence Generated Content" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the server publishes a training task and encourages clients’ participation through a crowdsourcing platform (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) with a data quality-aware reward allocation mechanism. By analyzing the convergence performance bound in AIGC-empowered FL scenario, we formulate the server’s cost in terms of model accuracy loss and payment to clients. Furthermore, we reveal server’s optimal incentive strategy to minimize its cost by fully studying clients’ rational behaviors under different information settings (i.e., complete and incomplete information scenarios).</p>

Compared with complete information scenario, the server may suffer from high cost to hedge the risk of no or very few clients participating in FL model training in incomplete information scenario. Hence, the server tends to boost the incentive reward especially in the case with a small number of candidate clients. Facing with small candidate client size of lower data quality, the adoption of AIGC service for data sysnthesis can bring a much more significant gain in server’s cost reduction for both complete and incomplete information scenarios.</p>

In reality, specifying a uniform data augmentation manner contributes to controlling the data quality of each client and predicting clients’ behavior especially in incomplete information scenarios.
Compared with training directly over the datasets only involving generated samples, in this paper the mixture of real-world and generated samples at clients’ sides incurs lower cost for data synthesis and possesses higher data quality instead. We verify this fact by evaluating the data quality of AIGC-enhanced datasets in theoretical perspective and conducting experiments as elaborated in Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="II-B Client’s

<p id="S2.SS4.p2.3" class="ltx_p">However, the calculation of model accuracy loss in AIGC-empowered FL faces great challenges, i.e., the heterogeneity of data quality and datasizes among clients, the mixture of different kinds of datasets (e.g., local or AIGC-enhanced dataset) used for local model updates due to clients’ different choices. To address this issue, we derive the convergence bound of the difference between the training loss in such AIGC-empowered FL scenario and optimal loss value over the local datasets of all clients.

Note that for simplicity, in this study we consider the batch data generation mode such that if a client decides to use its original local dataset for FL, it will not generate new dataset; otherwise, it will adopt the AIGC service to generate a higher-quality dataset before joining FL. We will further consider the more complicated iterative data generation mode in future study, such that a client can gradually and iteratively generate data samples (which is time-consuming and would slow down the FL operations) to improve its dataset during FL process.</p>

On the MNIST dataset, when clients possess a small number of classes, the proportion of generated data samples is higher in the AIGC-enhanced dataset, resulting in similar performance compared with the AIGC-only dataset.
Similarly, superior training accuracy of the AIGC-enhanced dataset on CIFAR10 datasets is evident in Fig. <a href="#S5.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ V-B Discussion on AIGC-enhanced dataset ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ IMFL-AIGC: Incentive Mechanism Design for Federated Learning Empowered by Artificial Intelligence Generated Content" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>, Fig. <a href="#S5.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ V-B Discussion on AIGC-enhanced dataset ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ IMFL-AIGC: Incentive Mechanism Design for Federated Learning Empowered by Artificial Intelligence Generated Content" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>, and Fig. <a href="#S5.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ V-B Discussion on AIGC-enhanced dataset ‣ V Performance Evaluation ‣ IMFL-AIGC: Incentive Mechanism Design for Federated Learning Empowered by Artificial Intelligence Generated Content" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>.
Notably, the AIGC-enhanced dataset not only demonstrates excellent training accuracy but also significantly reduces the costs associated with the data generation process compared to the AIGC-only dataset. The results obtained from the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets corroborate our theoretical findings and highlight the advantages of utilizing the AIGC-enhanced dataset.</p>

The reason is twofold: 1) with a small number of candidate clients, the server faces the risk of not recruiting enough clients for FL model training if an adequately high reward is not offered; 2) since the number of candidate clients is small, the server is inclined to incentivize clients to participate in FL with their AIGC-enhanced datasets. This implies that introducing generated data in FL possesses the capacity to significantly reduce server expenses, especially in scenarios characterized by limited candidate clients with lower data quality.</p>

This is because that NAIGC only considers the data quality of the local data for the clients, without introducing the generated data for data quality improvement, thus resulting in a degraded model accuracy. Also, as NDQ selects clients based on data quantity while neglecting the heterogeneity of data quality among clients, NDQ is inclined to select clients with lower data quality and hence achieves the lowest training accuracy. By introducing data generation capability and data quality awareness in our mechanism, clients can utilize data generation technique to enhance data quality, enabling FL model to converge to superior performance compared to NAIGC and NDQ, while also achieving the highest social welfare.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A plethora of studies on federated learning concentrate on improving training efficiency and final model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. For instance, Jeong et al. devise federated augmentations approach to rectify non-IID dataset for performance improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
By leveraging AIGC service, clients in FL can conduct data synthesis to mitigate data heterogeneity issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, most of the results are derived under an optimistic assumption that clients participate in FL voluntarily, and adopt AIGC services to generate data unconditionally, which may be unrealistic without proper incentives.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the data-computing cost and data generation cost (incurred by adopting AIGC service) of clients, incentive mechanism design is necessary for the server to compensate the cost of clients reasonably. However, existing works on incentive mechanism design for FL exhibit the following limitations. First, most of them considers only one or two dimensions of clients’ information (e.g., data-computing cost, data amount, etc.) for contribution evaluation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, which may not be directly applicable in realistic FL scenarios with data and resource heterogeneity. Second, few studies consider to capture the relationship between the quality of local model updates (which is related to local data distribution) and the global learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Third, most existing incentive mechanisms assume that the server is aware of all clients’ attributes, which is unrealistic in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. Fourth, faced the temptation of being rewarded, rational clients may optionally generate a high-quality data to participate in FL with a higher reward <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which further complicates the incentive mechanism design due to the complex client behaviors and is less understood in existing studies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There exist some emerging works attempt to deal with the aforementioned issues in different manners. For example, the authors study incentive mechanism with multi-dimensional clients’ private information under different levels of information
asymmetry by contract theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. The author propose a multi-dimensional procurement auction for incentive mechanism in FL based on auction analysis framework. Along a different line, in this paper we propose a lightweight data quality-aware incentive mechanism for AIGC-empowered FL.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a data quality-aware incentive mechanism to encourage clients’ participation in AIGC-empowered FL scenario. With rigorous analysis of convergence performance of FL model trained using a blend of real-world and generated data samples, we derive the optimal server’s incentive strategies both in complete and incomplete information scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that introducing AIGC service for FL scenarios enables significant cost reduction for the server.</p>
