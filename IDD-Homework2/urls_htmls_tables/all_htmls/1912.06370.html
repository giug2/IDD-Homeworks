<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In traditional machine learning, the central server first collects the data
owners’ private data together and then trains the model. However, people’s
concerns about data privacy protection are dramatically increasing.
The emerging paradigm of federated learning efficiently builds machine
learning models while allowing the private data to be kept at local
devices. The success of federated learning requires sufficient data
owners to jointly utilize their data, computing and communication
resources for model training. In this paper, we propose an auction
based market model for incentivizing data owners to participate in
federated learning. We design two auction mechanisms for the federated
learning platform to maximize the social welfare of the federated
learning services market. Specifically, we first design an approximate
strategy-proof mechanism which guarantees the truthfulness, individual
rationality, and computational efficiency. To improve the social welfare,
we develop an automated strategy-proof mechanism based on deep reinforcement
learning and graph neural networks. The communication traffic congestion
and the unique characteristics of federated learning are particularly
considered in the proposed model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed auction mechanisms can efficiently maximize the
social welfare and provide effective insights and strategies for the
platform to organize the federated training.</p>

The devices continuously
generate a large amount of fresh data. The traditional data analytics
and machine learning requires all the data to be collected to a centralized
data center/server, and then used for analysis or produce effective
machine learning models. This is the actual practice now conducted
by giant AI companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc.. However,
this approach may raise concerns regarding the data security and privacy.
Although various privacy preservation methods have been proposed,
such as differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and secure multi-party
computation (MPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, a large proportion of people
are still not willing to expose their private data which can be inspected
by the server. This discourages the development of advanced AI technologies
as well as new industrial applications. Motivated by the increasing
privacy concern among data owners, Google introduced the concept of
the <em id="S1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning (FL)</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The
FL is a collaborative learning scheme that distributes the training
process to individual users which then collaboratively train the shared
model while keeping the data on their devices, thus alleviating the
privacy issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A typical FL system is composed of two entities, including the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FL
platform</em> and the <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data owners</em>. Each data owner, e.g., mobile
phone user, has a set of private data stored at its local device.
The <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local data</em> are used to train a local machine learning model
where the initial model and hyper-parameters are preset by the FL
platform. Once the local training is completed, each data owner just
sends the trained model to the FL platform. Then, all received <em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local

or reaching the predefined number of iterations. Federated learning
has three distinctive characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>:</p>

for a successful FL task is the participation of a large base of data
owners that contribute sufficient training data. Therefore, establishing
an FL services market is necessary for the sustainable development
of the FL community. We propose an auction based market model to facilitate
commercializing federated learning services among different entities.
Specifically, the FL platform first initiates and announces an FL
task. When receiving the information of the FL tasks, each data owner
determines the service value by evaluating its local data quality
and the computing and communication capabilities. Then, data owners
report their types including bids representing the services value
and their resources information to the FL platform. According to the
received types, the platform selects a set of FL workers from data
owners and decides the service payments. Finally, the FL platform
coordinates the selected FL workers to conduct model training.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we mainly investigate the federated learning in the
wireless communication scenario and design applicable auction mechanisms
to realize the trading between the FL platform and the data owners.
From the system perspective, we aim to maximize their total utility,
i.e., social welfare. For an efficient and stable business ecosystem
of the FL services market, there are several critical issues about
FL task allocation and pricing. First, which data owner can participate
in the federated training as an FL worker? Due to the unique features
listed above, the FL platform should consider data owners’ reported
data size and non-IID degree of data. Also, the limited wireless spectrum
resource need to be reasonably allocated since the large population
of participated data owners may exacerbate the communication congestion.
Second, how to set reasonable payments for data owners such that they
can be incentivized to undertake the FL tasks? Auction is an efficient
method for pricing and task allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The payment
amount should satisfy individual rationality, which means there is
no loss to data owners from trading. We should also consider how to
make data owners truthfully expose their private types. The truthfulness
property can stabilize the market, prevent possible manipulation and
may significantly reduce the communication overhead and improve the
learning efficiency. The major contributions of this paper can be
summarized as follows:</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the resource constraints and the heterogeneity of devices,
some papers have discussed the optimal allocation of the resources
and tasks to improve the efficiency of federated training. The relevant
issues mainly include client selection, computation offloading and
incentive mechanism. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> designed a
protocol called FedCS. The FedCS protocol has a resource request phase
to gather information such as computing power and wireless channel
states from a subset of randomly selected clients, i.e., FL workers.
To tradeoff the accuracy and efficiency, the FL platform optimally
selects a set of clients that are able to punctually finish the local
training. Compared with the protocol that ignores the client selection,
the FedCS can achieve higher performance. Besides improving the training
efficiency, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> discussed the
fairness issue that if a protocol selects the clients by the computing
power, the final trained model would more cater to the data distribution
of clients with high computational capability. Based on the original
federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, a <math id="S2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="q" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">q</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑞</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1c">q</annotation></semantics></math>-FedAvg
training algorithm was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to give the client
with low performance a higher weight in optimizing the objective function.
For computation offloading, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> combined
the DRL and the FL to optimally allocate
the mobile edge computing (MEC) resources. The client can use the
DRL to intelligently decide whether to perform the training locally
or offload it to the edge server. The simulation results showed that
the DRL based approaches can achieve similar average utilities in
FL and centralized learning. With respect to the incentive mechanism
design, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a Stackelberg game
model to investigate the interactions between the server and the mobile
devices in a cooperative relay communication network. The mobile devices
determine the price per unit of data for individual profit maximization,
while the server chooses the size of training data to optimize its
own profit. The simulation results demonstrate that the interaction
can finally reach an equilibrium, and the cooperative communication
scheme can reduce the congestion and improve the energy efficiency.
In a similar setting of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>
proposed a contract theory method to incentivize the mobile devices
to take part in the FL and contribute high-quality data. The mobile
users can only choose the contract matching their own types to maximize
the utility. However, the above incentive mechanisms did not consider
the non-IID data or the wireless channel constraints which are taken
into account in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Different from the Stackelberg game and contract theory, the auction
mechanism allows the data owner to actively report its type and has been applied in various application scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Thus,
the FL platform can sufficiently understand their status and requests
to optimize the target performance metric, such as the social welfare
of the market or the platform’s revenue. To design a new auction mechanism
for higher performance or other properties that manually designed
auction mechanism cannot realize, the automated mechanism design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>Â assisted by machine learning techniques is gaining popularity. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the authors used the multi-layer neural network to model an auction
with the guarantee of individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>In this paper, truthfulness and incentive compatibility are used interchangeably.</span></span></span>
(IC).
The proposed deep learning based framework successfully recovered
all known analytical solutions to classical multi-item auction settings,
and discovered new mechanisms for settings where the optimal analytical
solution is unknown. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a strategyproof mechanism to deploy the mobile base station based on the deep learning technique, which significantly improved the social welfare of the wireless powered spatial crowdsourcing system. The study of using DRL to solve combinatorial problems over the graph was initialized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The
authors first calculated the graph embedding and then trained a deep
Q network to optimize several classical NP-hard problems in a greedy
style. Since the wireless channel conflicts among the data owners
are represented by a conflict graph in this paper, we propose an automated
auction mechanism based on DRL and GNN to optimize the social welfare
of FL services market while meeting the requirement of IC and IR.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.11" class="ltx_p">The platform cares about the data quality and needs a metric to quantify data owners’ potential contributions to the task completion. Due to the unique features of local data in FL, we focus on two critical attributes of local data: one is the <em id="S3.SS2.p2.11.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data size</em> and the other one is the <em id="S3.SS2.p2.11.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data distribution</em>. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and the experimental validation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, data size plays an essential role in improving the data quality where more data generally means better prediction performance. With respect to the data distribution, the conventional centralized learning, e.g., data center learning, usually assumes that the training data are independently and identically distributed (IID). However, the local data are user-specific and usually non-IID in the FL scenario. The characteristic of non-IID dominantly affects the performance,
e.g., prediction accuracy, of the trained FL model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Indicated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the accuracy reduction is mainly
due to the weights divergence which can be quantized by the earth
mover’s distance (EMD) metric. A large EMD value means
that the weights divergence is high which adversely affects the global
model quality.

With
respect to the communication cost, we ignore the communication overhead
and assume the channel is slow-fading and stable. Since this paper
focuses on the design of incentive mechanism, we consider a frequency-division
multiple-access (FDMA) communication scheme. This is also for simplicity
and minimum communication interference. Nonetheless, other more sophisticated
wireless communication configurations can be adopted with slight modification
in the cost function.</p>

Since the RMA guarantees that data owners in the same group have the
same virtual EMD value and the group selection is random (line 11),
data owners have no incentive to report false EMD value. Therefore,
we just need to discuss the truthfulness of the reported data size
and the bid. According to Theorem <a href="#Thmthm1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ IV Reverse Multi-dimensional Auction Mechanism for Federated Training ‣ Toward an Automated Auction Framework for Wireless Federated Learning Services Market" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, it

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the RMA mechanism can guarantee the IC, IR and CE, its achieved
social welfare is still restricted. The reasons are that the randomization
may degrade the social welfare performance and the channel conflicts
among workers is not well represented and exploited. Resolving these
issues is very challenging. In this section, we attempt to utilize
the powerful artificial intelligence (AI) to establish an automated
mechanism for improving the social welfare while ensuring the IC and
IR. Specifically, we first use the graph neural network (GNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>
to exploit the conflict relationships and generate effective embeddings.
Based on the embeddings, we propose a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) framework to design truthful auction mechanisms in order to
improve the social welfare.</p>

We observe that the social welfare and number of workers in the RMA and DRLA mechanisms both increase with growing data owners at a diminishing rate. The reason is two folds: First, the greedy algorithms only choose the worker that can improve the social welfare. Second, a larger base of interested workers will bring more competition in the auction and that more workers would also reduce the remaining workers’ marginal social welfare density. Although the DRLA can achieve higher social welfare than that of RMA mechanism, the DRLA is less fair since it is more capable of sequentially finding out the data owner with larger marginal social welfare. As mentioned in Section <a href="#S1" title="I Introduction ‣ Toward an Automated Auction Framework for Wireless Federated Learning Services Market" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, there is few research work discussing the auction mechanism dedicated for wireless federated learning. Since the key challenging issue in this paper is about the channel conflict, we attempt to apply a well-known strategyproof spectrum auction mechanism proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> as the benchmark. The benchmark auction mechanism decides the allocation only based on the bidders’ bid prices while avoiding the channel conflicts among the bidders. As shown in the Figure <a href="#S6.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ VI-B Performance of RMA and DRLA mechanisms ‣ VI Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ Toward an Automated Auction Framework for Wireless Federated Learning Services Market" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, the social welfare achieved by the benchmark auction mechanism is lower than the proposed auction mechanisms, although it provides better fairness. However, this paper focuses on the social welfare optimization and thus the benchmark mechanism is not suitable to be directly applied in our wireless federated learning scenario.</p>

is increasing while less workers are selected. More groups means the
virtual EMD difference among data owners is widening, so the RMA mechanism
can recognize more data owners with low original EMD value. When such
data owner with high data quality is found, there is less need to
choose other data owners with poor data quality.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed an auction based market model for
trading federated learning services in the wireless environment. We
have designed a reverse multi-dimensional auction (RMA) mechanism
for maximizing the social welfare of the federated learning services
market. The RMA mechanism not only considers workers’ bid prices for
providing training services but also takes each worker’s own multiple
attributes, including the data size, EMD, and wireless channel demand,
into account. To well evaluate each workers’ value, we have introduced
a data quality function verified by real world experiments to characterize
the relationship between the accuracy performance and the size and
average EMD of all local data. To further improve the social welfare,
we have proposed a deep reinforcement learning based auction (DRLA)
mechanism which uses the graph neural network to effectively extract
useful features from worker’s reported types and automatically determines
the service allocation and payment. Both the proposed RMA mechanism
and the DRLA mechanism possess the economic properties of truthfulness
and individual rationality.</p>
