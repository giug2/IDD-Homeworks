<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence solutions are essential in today’s data-driven applications, prioritizing principles such as robustness, safety, transparency, explainability, and privacy among others. This has led to the emergence of Federated Learning as a solution for privacy and distributed machine learning. While decision trees, as self-explanatory models, are ideal for collaborative model training across multiple devices in resource-constrained environments such as federated learning environments for injecting interpretability in these models.
Decision tree structure makes the aggregation in a federated learning environment not trivial. They require techniques that can merge their decision paths without introducing bias or overfitting while keeping the aggregated decision trees robust and generalizable.
In this paper, we propose
an Interpretable Client Decision Tree Aggregation process for Federated Learning scenarios that keeps the interpretability and the precision of the base decision trees used for the aggregation.
This model is based on aggregating multiple decision paths of the decision trees and can be used on different decision tree types, such as ID3 and CART.
We carry out the experiments within four datasets, and the analysis shows that the tree built with the model improves the local models, and outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Today’s data-driven applications require the search for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> solutions that not only focus on the accuracy of the model, leading traditional Machine Learning (ML) to approach Deep Learning (DL) solutions that can capture the complexity of the data. These approaches have led to a disregard for data privacy and data protection. To solve these problems, TAI requires to create a responsible AI system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> that goes beyond accuracy and focuses on the principles of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, safety, transparency, and explainability, among others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. To address this challenge, Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a solution at the intersection of data privacy and distributed ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, particularly relevant in the context of privacy and data protection, whether trustworthiness is required <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Transparency and explainability are crucial in a trustworthy system, which leads to the use of self-explanatory models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Decision Trees (DTs) are an example of self-explanatory models because their structure is inherently interpretable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, facilitating transparency and trust among stakeholders in FL environments. This interpretability is crucial, particularly in sensitive fields like healthcare or finances, where understanding the behavior behind the model is essential for stakeholder acceptance. DTs are lightweight and computationally efficient, which makes them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices, often found in FL. The simplicity and low computational requirements of DTs enable efficient model training and inference without compromising device performance or requiring extensive computing resources. These properties make DT a valuable asset in an FL environment. We can find in the literature approaches for DT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and for decision forests <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Aggregating DTs in an FL environment presents particular challenges due to the structure and characteristics of DTs, along with the intrinsic nature of FL. In the case of DTs, they consist of hierarchical structures with branching decision paths, making the direct aggregation not trivial. Contrary to parameter-based models, aggregating DTs requires techniques that can merge decision paths across the multiple nodes of the FL environment while preserving the interpretability and integrity of the resulting global model. DTs tend to be sensitive to data distribution and variance, which can vary a lot across the distributed nodes in FL scenarios. Aggregating DTs from diverse datasets without introducing bias or overfitting is also a considerable challenge. Methods for aggregating DTs need to ensure that the resulting global model is robust and generalizable across all nodes. Addressing these challenges requires the development of a specialized aggregation process tailored to the complexities of the DT models and the FL environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To address this challenge, we propose a novel aggregation process for DT in FL environments namely Interpretable Client Decision Tree Aggregator For FL, called ICDTA4FL process. This process filters the low-quality DTs and aggregates the decision paths of these DTs built at different nodes into a global DT, keeping the structure, interpretability, and privacy of the data while improving the performance of the local DTs. Rather than training for multiple rounds as with parametric-based methods, a single round is required in which DTs are decomposed into branches that are merged to form the global DT. The ICDTA4FL process works for multiple DT types. We present:

</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We conduct several experiments to ensure the performance of the ICDTA-4FL process. We compare our results against those from the state-of-the-art models.
We show the capability of the ICDTA4FL process to adapt to multiple DT algorithms, using ID3 and CART, with four different tabular datasets. We show how the global model obtained with the ICDTA4FL process improves the local DT model from the nodes, being scalable and generalizable. We analyze the results of the global model, and how it improves the local model while keeping the inherent interpretability and complexity from the original DTs. The ICDTA4FL process filters client’s DTs to delete possible noise added to the model by clients with low-performance DTs. The selected filter is important because it helps keep the model performance obtained when the number of clients increases.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A DT is a predictive model that maps different decisions in a branching structure. DTs are very powerful approaches used in ML to solve diverse problems, such as classification or regression problems. DTs are very popular in ML because of their simple structure, which makes the model explainable and understandable, but they still suffer from several drawbacks, such as instability. Two well-known DT algorithms are:

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the inherent limitations of individual DTs, ensemble learning techniques are used to improve the performance. Notable ensemble models include Random Forest (RF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) such as LightGBM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and XGBoost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. RF is a bagging technique for DTs that enhances
generalization and reduces overfitting. LightGBM and XGBoost, are extreme gradient boosting algorithms, that employ a sequential boosting technique, refining the model’s performance through iterative optimization. However, ensemble models lose the explainability from the inherited structure of the individual DTs. This makes them less desirable when interpretability is a key factor in solving a problem.

There are two steps that are dependent on the tree: the aggregation of the rules and the construction of the global DT using these aggregated rules.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the results obtained by the proposed ICDTA4FL process when clients train a CART tree model locally. As shown in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Background ‣ An Interpretable Client Decision Tree Aggregation process for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, there is no method in the state-of-the-art that builds only a CART tree model between the clients, so we can not make a comparison. Furthermore, we do not compare the ICDTA4FL-CART model with other models that used bagging and boosting techniques, as those techniques improve the single-tree performance, and here we are building a single tree.

To use the CART, it is necessary to preprocess the Nursery and the Car datasets, as they are categorical, so we have to transform their features into numerical features.

We select by default the mean as a threshold, but other metrics can be used, such as percentile, median, mode, etc., being more restrictive with the threshold. Filtering is essential in the ICDTA4FL process, as it helps eliminate the number of trees that may add noise to the global DT when the number of clients increases, due to the low quality of extracted DTs.

<p id="S5.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The reason for filtering the selected DTs is that, above all, in non-IID distributions there are clients with such low data, which trees will contribute with noise to the global model, harming its performance. To demonstrate this, we conducted an experiment using the ICDTA4FL process with the percentile as a filter. In Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.4 Robustness of percentile filtering along the ICDTA4FL process ‣ 5 Experimental Results and Analysis ‣ An Interpretable Client Decision Tree Aggregation process for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we show how the performance of the model varies in the Nursery dataset depending on the filter, based on different percentiles, being the results similar to the ones obtained when using the mean. Thus, the advantage of using a more restrictive filter is that it takes less time to build the model due to using fewer trees.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel aggregation process for DTs in an FL environment namely ICDTA4FL. The ICDTA4FL process surpasses the state-of-the-art methods that build a single tree, as shown in Sections <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1 The ICDTA4FL-ID3 model: Results and Analysis ‣ 5 Experimental Results and Analysis ‣ An Interpretable Client Decision Tree Aggregation process for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a> and <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 The ICDTA4FL-CART model: Results and Analysis ‣ 5 Experimental Results and Analysis ‣ An Interpretable Client Decision Tree Aggregation process for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>. The ICDTA4FL process is tree-independent, capable of aggregating different types of DTs such as ID3 and CART while keeping the interpretability and the structure of the DTs used. ICDTA4FL has been evaluated in an HFL environment, in both IID and Non-IID distributions over 4 datasets, and varying the number of clients. We have used ID3 and CART as the base model, getting the ICDTA4FL-ID3 and the ICDTA4FL-CART models.
