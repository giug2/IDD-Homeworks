<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data generation has been a growing area of research in recent years. However, its potential applications in serious games have not been thoroughly explored. Advances in this field could anticipate data modelling and analysis, as well as speed up the development process. To try to fill this gap in the literature, we propose a simulator architecture for generating probabilistic synthetic data for serious games based on interactive narratives. This architecture is designed to be generic and modular so that it can be used by other researchers on similar problems. To simulate the interaction of synthetic players with questions, we use a cognitive testing model based on the Item Response Theory framework. We also show how probabilistic graphical models (in particular Bayesian networks) can be used to introduce expert knowledge and external data into the simulation. Finally, we apply the proposed architecture and methods in a use case of a serious game focused on cyberbullying. We perform Bayesian inference experiments using a hierarchical model to demonstrate the identifiability and robustness of the generated data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Internet has become an integral part of young people’s lives. Minors under 18 years old already accounted for nearly one-third of Internet users worldwide back in 2017, according to UNICEF’s "Children in a Digital World" report <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The COVID-19 pandemic has enlarged such a phenomenon, making more minors spend more time online at younger ages. On the positive side, digital technology and hyper-connectivity come with significant educational and economic opportunities and better access to information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, uncontrolled access to the Internet also opens the door to new threats targeted toward minors, making them more accessible to bullies, harassers, and sex offenders. Children who were already vulnerable are now at greater risk. Around 10% of European children are already victims of cyberbullying (CB) every month <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and 49% have experienced a CB-related situation at least once <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Among European children who had already reported being a victim of CB, 44% reported an upsurge during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) have focused their efforts on this problem from the criminal component. However, some recent interdisciplinary initiatives (the H2020 RAYUELA project is a prominent example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>) propose to use Serious Games (SG) as an educational and research tool, thus fostering a preventive approach. SG are explicitly designed for a primary purpose beyond pure entertainment (e.g., learning new skills, conveying values, and awareness-raising) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, being entertaining is part of their attractiveness. In this context, the RAYUELA project’s central idea is to use video games’ natural appeal to gather data and educate minors. Specifically, the players are immersed in an adventure where they must make decisions involving potentially hazardous cybercrime-related situations. Data will be collected to understand better (using modern data science methods) which factors influence risky online behaviour in a friendly, safe and non-invasive way.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The idea of using video games as a research tool to investigate humans is not new and has been gaining popularity in recent years. For example, an experiment embedded in a video game showed that the complexity of the city where a child lives influences his or her future navigation skills <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Through a video grammar game called "<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Which English?</span>" it was shown that there is a "critical period" for learning a second language that extends into adolescence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. And a dilemma game involving millions of people explored the moral values of our societies and how they vary between countries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, several challenges must be overcome to establish video games as a rigorous and reliable research tool in behavioural or social science <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Synthetic data is a good candidate to address some of these challenges. For example, synthetic data can help with data privacy, fairness and augmentation, compensate for data deficiencies such as category imbalance or even produce data before the real one is available <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Although synthetic data is not a replacement for real data, it can accelerate developments and reduce costs and effort. In recent years, interest in using synthetic data in social or behavioural science research has notably increased <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">This paper’s primary goal is to generate synthetic data for serious games based on interactive narratives, such as the one used in the RAYUELA project, which focuses on cyberbullying. To this end, we propose a simulator architecture and bring two innovations to the state of the art. First, we present a generic methodology to introduce external data (e.g., expert knowledge, survey data) to the simulator through probabilistic graphical models, particularly Bayesian Networks (BN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Secondly, the synthetic agent model is based on the Item Response Theory (IRT) cognitive modelling framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. This latent variable framework has been extensively studied in the literature and has been shown to be far superior to classical test theory. In addition, it allows both the ’ability’ of the participant and the usefulness or difficulty of each question to be inferred. To the best of our knowledge, IRT has only been used in the literature for statistical inference, never for generating synthetic data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We have performed several Bayesian inference tests based on a hierarchical model to test the robustness and identifiability of the generated synthetic data. These experiments test the identifiability of the experiment parameters and serve as a guide to the expected precision when using Bayesian inference with real player data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Before detailing the proposed simulator architecture, we will review the design considerations and project constraints that led to the decisions made. Firstly, although the proposed architecture can be applied to other environments where participants must make a series of decisions or answer categorical questions, this work focuses on the specific problem of an interactive narrative serious game. Besides, it is noteworthy that in our work, the synthetic players do not aim to "win" the game but to approximate realistic human behaviours, in an approach more similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To ensure that the synthetic data better reflects reality, it is desirable to be able to introduce external information into the generative process (e.g. expert knowledge, surveys, prevalence data, etc.). It is also desirable to do this in a generic way, so that it is easy to experiment and introduce additional data at any time, and so that the proposed architecture can be used to address issues other than cyberbullying. To meet this design need, we propose using probabilistic graphical models, particularly Bayesian Networks (BN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. This model is a powerful visual and quantitative tool for expressing probabilistic relationships among variables. BNs consist of a direct acyclic graph (DAG) structure that encodes which variables are causally related to others, and each node of the network contains a conditional probability table (CPT). The structure and parameters of a BN can be learned from data, manually constructed (usually with the help of experts in the specific problem being addressed), or a combination of both. In addition, a trained BN can be used to generate synthetic data by sampling from the learned probability distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The ultimate goal of RAYUELA’s serious game is to identify different groups/clusters of players through the answers collected. In other words, to investigate whether the answers given in the serious game provide information about the players’ behaviours in the real world. We can model this environment as a sequence of multi-choice questions, where each player’s latent state changes the probability of choosing each option. This paper aims to generate synthetic data reflecting the internal states of the players and their cognitive decision-making process. Therefore, the proposed simulator must have a "decision maker" module that obtains the probabilities of choosing each answer from a given player profile and a question. To meet this design need, we propose using the IRT framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a testing theory based on the idea that the probability of a correct response to an item is a mathematical function of the respondent and item parameters. IRT is often regarded as superior to classical test theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, primarily because in addition to inferring the "ability" of the participant, it also takes into account the "difficulty" of each question when assessing (and other possible parameters in complex models). Our work will use IRT to generate synthetic data rather than for statistical inference. With this approach, we achieve to model the interactions between players and the in-game decisions they have to confront based on widely used psychological theories.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our proposed simulator models players’ decision processes probabilistically using a widely used test theory (IRT), while incorporating expert knowledge and external data (e.g. surveys, prevalence data, etc.) through the use of BN.</p>

This is achieved using a probabilistic model, such as BNs, where the expert knowledge is encoded into the network’s DAG structure, and network parameters (CPTs) are learned from external information. External information can also be incorporated to define the prior belief probability distributions. Moreover, BNs allow us to <span id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">interrogate</span> the model using "What if…?" questions to obtain quantifiable responses for events for which we have little or no data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We propose using a trained BN to generate synthetic data that the Agent Generator module will use to produce synthetic players with an individualised profile (in a probabilistic way). In addition, the synthetic data generated by the BN will be incorporated into the final synthetic dataset to make it more informative and helpful.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we will explain how we applied the proposed simulator architecture to the serious game of the RAYUELA project <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The game is an interactive narrative focused on cyberbullying, aiming to identify different groups/clusters of players through the collected responses. Specifically, to differentiate between risky and safe players regarding their online behaviour.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Following the proposed architecture (Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Architecture ‣ 2 Simulator ‣ Generation of Probabilistic Synthetic Data for Serious Games: A Case Study on Cyberbullying" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) and in order to generate synthetic data more faithful to reality, we will use a BN to introduce expert knowledge and external data into the simulation. The external data consists of a survey of minors in schools in Spain (Madrid and Valencia) during the year 2022. We collected 665 responses from students between 13 and 17 years old (Mean=14.5, SD=0.9), where 50.8% identified themselves as males, 47.4% as females, and 1.8% as non-binary. In this survey, we collected a series of demographic data, some questions about the participants’ relationship with new technologies (e.g., IoT devices) and the Internet, and finally, some inquiries about situations related to cyberbullying or cyber-harassment. Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3 Case Study: Serious Game on Cyberbullying ‣ Generation of Probabilistic Synthetic Data for Serious Games: A Case Study on Cyberbullying" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows a random sample of 5 survey participants.</p>

<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Once the BN has been trained with the survey data (i.e., external information) and we have defined the procedure for using the obtained probabilities to obtain the agents’ risk profiles, we can start generating synthetic data. We have created a dataset of 500 synthetic players participating in a game simulation of 15 dichotomous/binary questions. For this case study, we have defined the hyperparameters for the Gaussian distributions as described in Equation (<a href="#S3.E2" title="In 3 Case Study: Serious Game on Cyberbullying ‣ Generation of Probabilistic Synthetic Data for Serious Games: A Case Study on Cyberbullying" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). Note that the specific values we gave the hyperparameters are just an example that we believe is somewhat realistic. However, real players may behave differently, or the risky/safe groups may not even exist in the real world.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Following the analysis of the synthetic data and the proposed model, in this subsection we will analyse the robustness in the reconstruction of the parameters using the synthetic data, as a function of the number of agents and questions. To do so, we have used the hierarchical Bayesian model shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3.1 Identifiability Analysis ‣ 3 Case Study: Serious Game on Cyberbullying ‣ Generation of Probabilistic Synthetic Data for Serious Games: A Case Study on Cyberbullying" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The motivation for this analysis is that, as we have seen in the previous subsection, the parameters used to generate the synthetic data are reconstructable (i.e. the true value is in the 94% HDI of the posteriors). However, if these posteriors are too wide (i.e., low confidence in the prediction), they will not be helpful, even if the true value is still within the HDI range. Therefore, in this analysis, we will systematically examine the "width" of the estimated posteriors while varying the number of agents and questions generated. In other words, we will analyse the confidence with which the Bayesian model has inferred the generation parameters.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have proposed and implemented a simulator capable of generating probabilistic synthetic data for serious games based on interactive narratives. For this purpose, we have created a generic modular simulator (Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 Architecture ‣ 2 Simulator ‣ Generation of Probabilistic Synthetic Data for Serious Games: A Case Study on Cyberbullying" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) that allows tackling similar problems with little or no redesign effort. The proposed architecture makes two main contributions to state of the art. On the one hand, we propose a methodology to introduce external data (e.g., expert knowledge, survey data) into the simulation through probabilistic graphical models, particularly Bayesian networks. On the other hand, the mathematical modelling of the synthetic agents is based on the Item Response Theory (IRT) framework. This latent variable framework has been extensively studied in the literature and has been shown to be far superior to classical test theory. To the best of our knowledge, IRT has only been used in the literature for statistical inference, never for generating synthetic data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data generation offers several benefits, such as augmenting data, dealing with missing data or improving fairness and privacy. In our case, one clear-cut benefit is that creating unlimited but also variable meaningful data allows us to anticipate the data modelling and analysis, speed up the development process and reduce the cost of our use case.
The use case presented is framed in the RAYUELA project <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, where we intend to use a serious game based on an interactive narrative to prevent and better understand the phenomenon of cyberbullying. Using the data from a custom-built survey of minors in Spain, we built our model using the proposed architecture, expert knowledge, and external data. In particular, we collected 665 responses from students between 13 and 17 years old in this survey. The survey gathers demographic data, questions about the participants’ relationship with new technologies and the Internet, and inquiries about cyberbullying or cyber-harassment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We have performed several Bayesian inference tests based on a hierarchical model to test the robustness and identifiability of the generated synthetic data. The Bayesian nature of the model allows us to infer the model’s confidence (uncertainty) in its predictions. These experiments test the identifiability of the experiment parameters and serve as a guide to the expected precision when using Bayesian inference with real player data. Furthermore, using the IRT paradigm with Bayesian inference allows us to infer parameters about the game questions and deduce their discriminatory ability (in our case study, their ability to differentiate players according to their risk propensity).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">With this paper, we aim to fill the gap in the literature on synthetic data generation in serious games and thus help other researchers to address typical problems such as data sparsity or privacy and to accelerate development processes. Among the many possible future lines of work, we can highlight the validation of the proposed IRT model with real players answering questions in the RAYUELA game.</p>
