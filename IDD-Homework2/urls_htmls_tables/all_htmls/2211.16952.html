<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">With the booming deployment of Internet of Things, health monitoring applications have gradually prospered. Within the recent COVID-19 pandemic situation, interest in permanent remote health monitoring solutions has raised, targeting to reduce contact and preserve the limited medical resources. Among the technological methods to realize efficient remote health monitoring, federated learning (FL) has drawn particular attention due to its robustness in preserving data privacy.
However, FL can yield to high communication costs, due to frequent transmissions between the FL server and clients.
To tackle this problem, we propose in this paper a communication-efficient federated learning (CEFL) framework that involves clients clustering and transfer learning. First, we propose to group clients through the calculation of similarity factors, based on the neural networks characteristics. Then, a representative client in each cluster is selected to be the leader of the cluster. Differently from the conventional FL, our method performs FL training only among the cluster leaders. Subsequently, transfer learning is adopted by the leader to update its cluster members with the trained FL model. Finally, each member fine-tunes the received model with its own data. To further reduce the communication costs, we opt for a partial-layer FL aggregation approach. This method suggests partially updating the neural network model rather than fully. Through experiments, we show that CEFL can save up to to 98.45% in communication costs while conceding less than 3% in accuracy loss, when compared to the conventional FL. Finally, CEFL demonstrates a high accuracy for clients with small or unbalanced datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Internet of Things (IoT) technology has raised in recent years allowing its application in several areas such as e-health wearable devices, smart homes, autonomous cars, etc. IoT technology has been constantly improving our lives, and one of the most rapidly developing IoT services is health monitoring. Indeed, IoT sensors can be used to observe a patient’s condition, detect early an illness, or alert the medical staff about a critical health condition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Within a pandemic situation where the medical staff is constantly under pressure, remote health monitoring has been rapidly developing to partially alleviate this burden. Supported by IoT devices, remote health systems can reliably ensure self-treatment at home, detect and monitor emergency situations such as a heart attack or falling of an elderly, and automatically calling for assistance from the adequate first responder staff <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order for these services to be efficient, data need to be collected from IoT devices, filtered, and processed. For instance, to predict a falling event, motion data need to be analyzed, while electroencephalography (EEG) signal and heart rate history data can serve to synthesize an in-depth report and pre-diagnose an illness.
Data processing would typically rely on cloud computing platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To make remote health monitoring more accurate, large-scale machine learning (ML) approaches can be leveraged. However, the associated centralized data and model training process bring serious data security and privacy concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Rather than learning from centrally collected user data and being exposed to the risk of privacy leakage, federated learning (FL) can address this problem using a collaborative model through the communication of only the training model, while keeping the training process and data at the local level, i.e., close to patients.
However, FL raises other concerns, such as high communication costs and systems heterogeneity
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Indeed, frequent communications can rapidly become the bottleneck of the FL development. This is caused mainly by the important number of communication rounds between the server and clients and the size of transmitted data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this context, we aim here to reduce the communication costs of FL, applied for a specific health monitoring service example, i.e., patients activity detection. To do so, we propose the integration of graph clustering and transfer learning techniques into FL, which would drastically reduce the data exchange rounds. Specifically, FL is realized among only a fraction of the available clients with highly significant data features, and with limited data exchange. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first ones that combines such techniques in order to reduce the communication costs of FL. Subsequently, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For electronic health records, Liu <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. proposed federated-autonomous deep learning to train different parts of the FL model using all or specific data sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
To cope with the unbalanced distributed datasets in the edge computing system, Duan <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. built a self-balancing FL framework that uses data augmentation and multi-client rescheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Similarly, a cloud-edge based FedHome framework was proposed by Wu <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. to handle the unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed data via the generative convolutional autoencoder, thus realizing accurate and personalized health monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, an efficient activity recognition application based on FL has been developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. FL was used to mitigate the privacy violation problem and to reduce data collection costs for centralized training, while
Fang <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> privacy preservation and communication costs reduction through the use of a lightweight encryption protocol.
Focusing on the FL communication efficiency only, researchers proposed compression-based methods to reduce the size of the communicated model. For instance, Konečný <span id="S2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. proposed to reduce the size of the uplink data through structured and sketched updates, where an update is learned from a restricted parameterized space and compressed prior to upload <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Also, sparse ternary compression was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which is proved to be more robust and converge faster than the federated averaging benchmark. Other communication cost reduction approaches include FedPAQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> that allows only partial device participation and periodic server averaging for quantized message uploads, and CMFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which reduces the number of updates by eliminating irrelevant ones to the global model improvement tendency.</p>

Our choice of clustering algorithm is motivated by its fast convergence, implementation simplicity, and customizability.
The Louvain algorithm is a greedy approach that allows to optimize the modularity as it runs. The modularity score (between -0.5 and 1) measures the relative density of edges inside communities with respect to those outside communities. When using the Louvain algorithm, the number of clusters needs to be specified according to the demand for cluster sizes.

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FL experiments conducted on this work are related to a health monitoring application, where collected data from patients is analyzed to identify their activities. Specifically, we relied on the public dataset MobiAct<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. MobiAct is a dataset for activity recognition, where data from 67 patients, between the ages of 20 and 47, is obtained and labelled. Data is collected using the patients’ smartphones when they are performing different activities. The application focuses on four types of fall activities and nine types of daily activities. For the sake of simplicity, we decide to focus only on activities that indicate possible upcoming falling, thus reducing the number of recognizable classes to eight types only, namely the initial fall activity classes, i.e., forward-lying, front-knees-lying, sideward-lying, and sack-sitting-chair, three fall-like activity classes, i.e., sit chair, car step in, car step out, and one daily activity class including all of standing, walking, jogging, jumping, stairs up and stairs down types.</p>

Regular FL converges the fastest due to the continuous participation of all clients in the training process. Our method CEFL converges also fast due to transfer learning between leaders and cluster members. In contrast, FedPer converges slowly since there is no information sharing for the personalized layers. Finally, Individual Training converges the slowest due to the independent operation of clients. The shaded areas around curves indicate the standard deviation of accuracy. As it can be seen, CEFL and Regular FL demonstrate the most stable performance behaviour, while the remaining two methods have a higher deviation, which indicates an unstable convergence trend.</p>

Chu is with the School of Information and Communication Engineering of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, email: dong.chu.uestc@gmail.com. W.

Yanikomeroglu is with the Systems and Computer Engineering department of Carleton University, ON, Canada, email: halim@sce.carleton.ca." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. Specifically, we select clients 4, 31, and 50 characterized as follows: Client 4 owns 831 training samples that are representative of all 8 activity classes; Client 31 has only 101 training samples that are from the four types of fall activities only; and Client 50 has 570 training samples, with a predominance of 431 samples from a single activity class (daily activity). From Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-C Results and Discussion ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ On the Design of Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Health Monitoring D. Chu is with the School of Information and Communication Engineering of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, email: dong.chu.uestc@gmail.com. W.

Yanikomeroglu is with the Systems and Computer Engineering department of Carleton University, ON, Canada, email: halim@sce.carleton.ca." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we notice that the accuracy of Client 4 is the highest compared to others. This is expected since it has the highest number and most representative data distribution among the targeted classes. In contrast, the accuracy of Client 31 is the worst due to its small-sized and unbalanced dataset. Although Client 50 has a relatively large-sized dataset, its unbalance significantly impacts the accuracy performance. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the different methods are almost the same for Client 50, while a significant gap is present for Client 31.
Consequently, we conclude that our method has a similar performance to Regular FL when the client’s dataset is small or highly unbalanced, while for clients with large or relatively balanced datasets, a slight performance gap can be noticed as in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-C Results and Discussion ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ On the Design of Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Health Monitoring D.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes CEFL for health monitoring. CEFL consists of two steps: FL among cluster leaders and transfer learning from leaders to cluster members. Our method CEFL can reduce communication costs due to its small-scale FL among only selected leaders, selected through graph clustering and based on clients’ mutual similarity. By inheriting trained models from the corresponding leader, cluster members can rapidly achieve an acceptable accuracy on their own datasets. Compared to baselines, CEFL achieves a great balance between communication and accuracy.
Specifically, the communication cost can be reduced up to 98.45% at the expense of less than 3% accuracy degradation, compared to the best baseline. Moreover, for clients with small or highly imbalanced datasets, CEFL yields as high accuracy as the best baseline with at a fraction of the communication cost.</p>
