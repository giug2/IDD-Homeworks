<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Heterogeneous data captured by different scanning devices and imaging protocols can affect the generalization performance of the deep learning magnetic resonance (MR) reconstruction model. While a centralized training model is effective in mitigating this problem, it raises concerns about privacy protection. Federated learning is a distributed training paradigm that can utilize multi-institutional data for collaborative training without sharing data. However, existing federated learning MR image reconstruction methods rely on models designed manually by experts, which are complex and computational expensive, suffering from performance degradation when facing heterogeneous data distributions. In addition, these methods give inadequate consideration to fairness issues, namely, ensuring that the model’s training does not introduce bias towards any specific dataset’s distribution. To this end, this paper proposes a generalizable federated neural architecture search framework for accelerating MR imaging (GAutoMRI). Specifically, automatic neural architecture search is investigated for effective and efficient neural network representation learning of MR images from different centers. Furthermore, we design a fairness adjustment approach that can enable the model to learn features fairly from inconsistent distributions of different devices and centers, and thus enforce the model generalize to the unseen center. Extensive experiments show that our proposed GAutoMRI has better performances and generalization ability compared with six state-of-the-art federated learning methods. Moreover, the GAutoMRI model is significantly more lightweight, making it an efficient choice for MR image reconstruction tasks. The code will be made available at https://github.com/ternencewu123/GAutoMRI.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can effectively assess the structure, morphology, and function of soft tissues. It plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and disease evaluation due to its ability to provide detailed and comprehensive information. However, acquiring fully-sampled <math id="S1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>-space data is usually time-consuming due to the physical limitations of the scanning device<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. One possible way to improve the imaging speed is to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Recently, deep learning has shown great potential in accelerating MR image reconstruction<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Deep learning offers the advantage of fast online reconstruction through offline learning from large datasets. However, due to factors like varying scanning devices, imaging protocols, and other discrepancies, the distribution of data among different centers can become highly heterogeneous. As a consequence, generalizing a model trained in one center to other centers becomes a challenging task, and ensuring the stability of the model becomes equally difficult. This could lead to biased performance at different centers. One conventional approach is to aggregate data from multiple centers for centralized learning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, collecting data from multiple centers can lead to significant resource consumption and may leak patient privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address this limitation, federated learning emerges as a promising framework that allows multi-institutional collaborative learning while protecting patient privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In federated learning, each client independently trains a local model using its computational resources and private data. Subsequently, the server collects these locally trained models from all clients and employs an aggregation approach to get the server model. Finally, the server distributes the aggregated model to the clients for the subsequent communication rounds<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
The classical federated learning method FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is effective for client model aggregation with the same distribution, but in MRI, the data distribution of different clients may present heterogeneity caused by different tissue contrasts, imaging protocols, and other factors. This may cause models trained by federated learning to suffer performance degradation. To this end, several federated learning MRI methods have been proposed to alleviate this problem. In<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, the similarity of latent-space representations is improved by repeatedly aligning the source and target sites. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, client specificity is maintained by dividing the reconstruction model into a globally shared encoder and a locally personalized decoder. While existing federated learning MRI reconstruction methods have achieved promising performance, the reconstruction models of these methods typically utilize hand-designed network architectures, which are often complex and require more computational resources. Additionally, these methods also rarely consider the fairness of the algorithm, which involve an obvious performance gap of the model across different centers, especially in the case of heterogeneous data distributions. This makes it difficult to generalize the trained model to other centers<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">

A typical NAS architecture consists of three parts: search space, search approach, and evaluation approach. Recently, there have been some works on utilizing NAS alone for MR image reconstruction<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. All of these methods have yielded improved results, achieving better performance with fewer model parameters when compared to the existing hand-designed models. However, these methods don’t consider heterogeneous data distributions from different centers.</p>

These methods can avoid manual fine-tuning of optimization parameters. Deep learning-based MR image reconstruction methods can be broadly categorized into data-driven<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and model-driven approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Data-driven methods typically rely on large amounts of data and directly learn the mapping relationship from undersampled data to fully-sampled data. However, the networks could be totally black-box. Model-driven approaches formulate an optimization problem and then unfold the iterative optimization algorithm into the network. The network architecture is constructed based on iterative steps, leading to a slightly longer reconstruction time. While these methods have made certain contributions to the development of MR image reconstruction, they all require the collection of large amounts of data for centralized training. This undoubtedly increases labor costs and resource consumption, and it also brings a serious issue—data privacy leakage. We utilize a distributed collaborative training scheme to effectively avoid the problems of data collection and patient privacy leakage.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a distributed collaborative training paradigm that protects data privacy by training shared model without sharing data<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. One of the most classical federated learning methods is FedAvg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which obtains the global model through an average aggregation method, and it obtains a relatively better performance when the data distributions of different centers are similar. However, in real-world scenarios, there is often statistical heterogeneity among different centers, and the traditional federated learning methods are difficult to adapt to such requirements. Some works start to reconcile the differences between global and local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, aiming to obtain a global model with better performance. For example, Li et al.,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> facilitate the learning of the global model by imposing an additional constraint on the client’s objective function. In addition, there are also some proposed personalized federated learning methods to preserve the specificity of local data. For example, Zhang et al.,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a local adaptive aggregation approach to improve the performance of local clients by adaptively aggregating global and local models. As for magnetic resonance imaging, the problem of data heterogeneity may also exist in different centers due to scanning devices, imaging protocols, and other issues<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Some methods start to solve the problems of feature drift and domain generalization. For example, Guo et al.,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> reduces the data heterogeneity of clients by repeatedly aligning the hidden feature distributions between the source and target domains. It selects a target site in each communication round and then aligns it with the representation of the remaining sites, which adds more communication consumption. In addition, Feng et al.,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> effectively preserve local client-specific features by dividing the reconstruction model into a globally shared encoder and a locally personalized decoder. These approaches effectively mitigate the privacy leakage problem, but their model architectures are hand-designed by experts, which are often complex and require more computational resources. We utilize an automatically differentiable architecture search method to obtain an optimal model architecture, effectively reducing the number of model parameters and the need for computational resources.</p>

These NAS-based MR image reconstruction methods are used for centralized training scenarios but have not yet been explored in federated learning scenarios. In this paper, we utilize federated learning and neural architecture search for MR image reconstruction and improve the generalization performance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data through a fairness adjustment approach.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After the searching phase, we can obtain an optimal model architecture, which is subsequently utilized for the training phase. However, some existing federated MR image reconstruction methods seldom consider inter-client fairness issues, leading to performance degradation of the trained global model on out-of-distribution data, especially when faced with statistical heterogeneity among clients. Intuitively, if the global model does not discriminate in performance on known clients (i.e., the performance gap is small on each client), then it logically should exhibit respectable performance even when faced with out-of-distribution data. Based on this notion, we introduce a fairness adjustment approach that utilizes the difference between the empirical risks of the global and local models in each communication round. This approach dynamically adjusts the aggregation weights of the clients, aiming to progressively diminish the performance gap of the global model across the known clients. As a result, this approach gradually improves the generalization performance of the global model on out-of-distribution data. Formally, the empirical risk gap between global and local models can be expressed as:</p>

In the searching phase, the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 is used to update architecture parameters, and the weight decay is set to 1e-3. Besides, the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 is used to update local model parameters. We set the batch size to 4. The models are trained with 50 global communication rounds and 5 local epochs for each round. In the training phase, the AdamW optimizer is adopted. We set the batch size and initial learning rate to 24 and 1e-3, respectively. Networks are trained with 150 global communication rounds and 5 local epochs for each round.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B In-Distribution Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Generalizable Learning Reconstruction for Accelerating MR Imaging via Federated Neural Architecture Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> provides the quantitative results of the different methods under <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">In-Distribution</span> scenario. From Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B In-Distribution Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Generalizable Learning Reconstruction for Accelerating MR Imaging via Federated Neural Architecture Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, we can see that our method is superior to other FL methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. Compared with the classical FedAvg method, the average value of the PSNR metric of our GAutoMRI improves from 32.3288 dB to 35.5253 dB, and the average value of the SSIM metric increases from 0.8958 to 0.9384. This is primarily attributed to the fact that FedAvg uses an average aggregation approach, which does not adapt well to the statistical heterogeneity of the client. Comparatively, personalized federated learning methods (FedMRI and FedALA) perform better than FedAvg. They exhibit improved adaptability to local data distributions by maintaining client specificity. The <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">In-house</span> dataset comprises data with three different contrasts, resulting in greater heterogeneity, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-A1 Datasets ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Generalizable Learning Reconstruction for Accelerating MR Imaging via Federated Neural Architecture Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Therefore, the performance of all methods on this dataset is slightly lower compared to their performance on the other two datasets. However, relatively speaking, our method still maintains a better performance, proving the superiority of our methods. Furthermore, our fairness adjustment approach contributes to achieving an obviously improved performance balance for each client.</p>

In terms of PSNR and SSIM values, our proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to the other methods. Compared to FedAvg, PSNR and SSIM improved from 27.8763 dB and 0.8271 to 30.0927 dB and 0.8602 under different sampling pattern; and PSNR and SSIM improved from 28.6256 dB and 0.8403 to 31.8182 dB and 0.8938 under different acceleration rate. This indicates that our approach demonstrates obviously improved performance on out-of-distribution data, and also shows that our approach has better generalization performance. The <span id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">In-house</span> dataset consists of three modalities, resulting in a notably heightened level of data heterogeneity.

Compared to FedAvg, under different contrast, PSNR improved from 29.7607 dB to 34.6154 dB, and SSIM improved from 0.9126 to 0.9647. Under the unseen center, PSNR improved from 29.0923 dB to 31.5570 dB, and SSIM improved from 0.7879 to 0.8834. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-A1 Datasets ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Generalizable Learning Reconstruction for Accelerating MR Imaging via Federated Neural Architecture Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the disparity between the data distributions of fastMRI T1 and T2 is relatively small, resulting in somewhat lesser performance degradation for all methods in scenarios involving different contrast. Generalizing models trained on heterogeneous data distributions to the unseen center is a more challenging task. However, our GAutoMRI also maintains a better performance, attributed to the fairness adjustment approach we introduced. This approach enhances generalization under the unseen center by mitigating the performance gap of the global model across known centers. AM is a domain generalization method, and its performance is the best except for our method. Furthermore, we also compared the parameter size of individual client models. As indicated in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-C2 Different Contrast and Unseen Center ‣ IV-C Out-of-Distribution Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Generalizable Learning Reconstruction for Accelerating MR Imaging via Federated Neural Architecture Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, the model obtained through the neural architecture search exhibits a notably reduced parameter size, which indicates that our approach is more efficient. In addition, we visualized the reconstructed images and the corresponding error maps for the different methods, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-C1 Different Sampling Pattern and Acceleration Rate ‣ IV-C Out-of-Distribution Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Generalizable Learning Reconstruction for Accelerating MR Imaging via Federated Neural Architecture Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. From the error maps, it can be seen that the error of our method is minimized, indicating our method outperforms the other methods. Overall, our proposed method has better generalization performance.</p>

Compared to the hand-designed model, the performance of the model obtained using the neural architecture search exhibits an improved performance. The PSNR and SSIM metrics have been improved from 33.8465 dB and 0.9126 to 35.2859 dB and 0.9342, respectively. GAutoMRI requires only about 18% of the computational and parameter sizes of the baseline model, underscoring the efficiency of the searched model. Upon incorporating the fairness adjustment approach, there is a clear improvement in the average metrics, even though there is a slight decline in performance on the <span id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">cc359</span> dataset.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on addressing the generalization issue of deep learning MR image reconstruction models towards heterogeneous data captured by different scanning devices and imaging protocols, using multi-institutional data in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, we propose a generalizable federated neural architecture search framework, GAutoMRI. In the framework, we first design an adapted search space for undersampled MR image reconstruction task, and then learn an optimal model from heterogeneous data distributions with differentiable federated neural architecture search. In addition, we design a fairness adjustment approach that
can enable the model to learn features fairly from inconsistent
distributions of different devices. Extensive experiments on different sampling patterns, acceleration rates, contrasts, and unseen centers demonstrate that our proposed GAutoMRI has better generalization and performances compared to six state-of-the-art federated learning methods.</p>
