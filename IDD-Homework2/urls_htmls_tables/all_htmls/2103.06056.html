<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The deployment of federated learning in a wireless network, called <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</em> (FEEL), exploits low-latency access to distributed mobile data to efficiently train an AI model while preserving data privacy. In this work, we study the spatial (i.e., spatially averaged) learning performance of FEEL deployed in a large-scale cellular network with spatially random distributed devices. Both the schemes of digital and analog transmission are considered, providing support of error-free uploading and over-the-air aggregation of local model updates by devices. The derived spatial convergence rate for digital transmission is found to be constrained by a limited number of active devices regardless of device density and converges to the ground-true rate exponentially fast as the number grows. The population of active devices depends on network parameters such as processing gain and signal-to-interference threshold for decoding. On the other hand, the limit does not exist for uncoded analog transmission. In this case, the spatial convergence rate is slowed down due to the direct exposure of signals to the perturbation of inter-cell interference. Nevertheless, the effect diminishes when devices are dense as interference is averaged out by aggressive over-the-air aggregation. In terms of learning latency (in second), analog transmission is preferred to the digital scheme as the former dramatically reduces multi-access latency by enabling simultaneous access.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The availability of enormous data at edge devices motivate the deployment of machine-learning algorithms at the network edge to distill the data into <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">artificial intelligence</em> (AI). The trained AI models are expected to enable a wide range of next-generation mobile applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. Fast growing relevant research has led to the emergence of a new area called <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">edge learning</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In this area, federated learning is perhaps the most widely studied framework due to its feature of preserving data privacy by avoiding their uploading. To this end, a model-training task is distributed over devices using the iterative algorithm of <em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stochastic-gradient descent</em> (SGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. A main vein of research on edge learning concerns efficient implementation of federated learning in wireless systems, call <em id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated edge learning</em> (FEEL). In this work, we study the performance of FEEL in a large-scale cellular network where inter-cell interference is present. The results help crystalizing the effects of network parameters on the (model) convergence rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the area of FEEL, recent years have seen the development of diversified approaches for overcoming the communication bottleneck, which is caused by the uploading of high-dimensional model updates from multiple devices to a server. One approach is efficient joint management of communication-and-computation resources via designing scheduling and bandwidth allocation to accelerate convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
From the theoretic perspective, researchers have attempted to shed light on the fundamental question of how many devices are needed for providing a guarantee on learning performance within a finite time duration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. An alternative approach is to realize “over-the-air aggregation” of local model updates so as to support simultaneous access by many devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The core idea is to adopt analog transmission so as to exploit the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. The versatility and efficiency of over-the-air aggregation has been improved by the development of numerous relevant techniques including digital aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, gradient compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, power control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and beamforming <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Another approach is source compression. Some existing techniques exploit local-model sparsity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> or enable efficient model quanization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In view of prior work, most results assume single-cell systems. The topic of deploying FEEL in a large-scale network remains one largely unexplored. In this scenario, learning performance is affected by inter-cell interference as well as network configurations. Recently, some initial work has accounted for such an effect in designing device-scheduling schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. While the work points to the important direction of FEEL networking, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. In particular, a question of our interest is how the convergence depends on the network parameters (i.e., device density, cell sizes, and coding rates), which parameterize the interference distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A standard approach of characterizing the effect of inter-cell interference on network performance, which is also adopted in this work, is to model the randomly located network nodes (devices or base stations) as spatial point processes such as a <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Poisson point process</em> (PPP) or its derivatives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Consequently, the interference power can be modelled as a shot-noise process, referring to a sum over a PPP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Then the study of network performance is reduced to the equivalent analysis of the expected performance of a <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">typical cell</em>, which results from uniformly sampling all cells, over the distributions of interference, channels, and nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Such analysis leverages a rich set of results from the stochastic-geometry theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The tractability brought by the theory has motivated many researchers to use it as a tool to study the performance of a wide range of wireless networks such as cellular networks (see e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>), cooperative networks (see e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>), heterogeneous networks (see e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>), and most recently unmanned aerial vehicle networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Most existing work is based on the classic “communication-and-computation separation” approach. To be specific, the considered networks aim at providing generic radio-access services to users or sensors without concerning their applications. The corresponding design objective is to ensure the required quality-of-service, network throughput or coverage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In contrast, the study of a FEEL network, referring to a network supporting the FEEL application, should adopt a learning-related metric for network performance such as the proposed metric of convergence rate in a typical cell, termed <em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">spatial convergence rate</em>. The corresponding network-performance analysis is differentiated from existing analysis in its interplay of stochastic geometry and learning theories, which is a key feature of current analysis.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we consider a large-scale network with hexagonal cells and devices distributed following a PPP. FEEL is deployed in a typical cell. For the reason, the corresponding model convergence is termed <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">spatial convergence</em>. Uplink transmission by each device is based on either digital or analog (over-the-air aggregation) transmission and protected against interference using <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">frequency-hopping spread spectrum</em> (FHSS) following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. By analyzing the spatial convergence rate, we quantify the effects of network parameters on the learning performance for different transmission schemes and scenarios (i.e., low and high mobility). The key findings are summarized as follows.</p>

The deviation results from inter-cell interference and a random number of devices that succeed in transmission (i.e., a random data size), called <em id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">successful devices</em>. The key findings are as follows. First, as the device density grows, the expected number of successful devices converges to a constant and thereby introduces a limit to the learning performance. The expected number is proportional to the processing gain of spread spectrum, decreases with a growing <em id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">signal-to-interference</em> (SIR) threshold for successful transmission, but is insensitive to variations of cell sizes. Second, the mentioned rate deviation diminishes <em id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">exponentially fast</em> as the expected number of successful devices increases. Last, channel-temporal diversity due to high mobility increases the chance of a device to succeed in transmission and participate in at least one round of the learning process, which increases the spatial-convergence rate.</p>

The corresponding spatial convergence rate is derived by applying results on the interference distribution from stochastic geometry to the convergence analysis. The rate deviation from the ground truth reveals two conflicting effects of increasing the devices density. On one hand, without outage, the expected number of active devices participating in learning can grow unboundedly as the density increases. Consequently, more training data lead to faster spatial convergence. On the other hand, increasing the device density also causes the number of significant interferers to grow, which perturbs the SGD process and slows down spatial convergence. As the first scaling law is faster than the second, the net effect is found to be a higher spatial convergence rate when devices are denser. This makes analog transmission a favourable choice over the digital counterpart in a dense network.</p>

The latency of analog transmission is observed to be much lower than the digital-transmission counterpart in both sparse and dense networks. The low-latency of analog transmission in a sparse network results from more active devices (i.e., fewer rounds) and that in a dense network from shorter per-round latency.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we consider the digital-transmission case and study the effects of network parameters on the spatial learning performance. To this end, we derive a sufficient condition for meeting the spatial convergence criterion and analyze the corresponding bound on the minimum expected learning latency.

The reason is that in the former case, more cells are able to support FEEL and hence a more relaxed spatial convergence criterion. Note that the above analysis is based on approximation and bounds. Therefore, the actual quantification may not be accurate despite yielding the correct conclusion. More significant latency reduction due to high mobility is observed from experimental results in the sequel. </em><span id="Thmremark5.p1.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"></span></p>

In this section, it is analyzed for the analog-transmission case that enables low-latency over-the-air aggregation. We assume low mobility. The extension of the results to the case of high mobility is similar to that in the preceding section. As it yields no new insight, the details are omitted for brevity.

The effect can be expressed mathematically by deriving the deviation of the aggregated gradient from the ground truth as follows.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we have investigated the spatial convergence of FEEL deployed in a typical cell of a large-scale cellular network. Both the schemes of digital and analog transmission are considered. In terms of spatial convergence rate (in round), digital transmission is preferred for low-to-medium device densities while convergence with analog transmission is faster when devices are dense. On the other hand, in terms of learning latency (in second), analog transmission is always preferred due to its support of low-latency over-the-air aggregation.</p>

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This work opens the direction of distributed edge learning in large-scale cellular networks, in which numerous topics warrant further investigation. In particular, a more complex network topology including both backhaul and radio-access links can be considered to support hierarchical federated learning involving edge devices, edge servers and central-could servers. Moreover, the current work suggests the need of optimizing network parameters (e.g., SIR threshold), which can be further investigated to improve the learning performance. Furthermore, for the deployment of FEEL in 5G networks, it is interesting to study the effects of advanced physical-layer techniques (i.e., massive MIMO and non-orthogonal access) on the spatial learning performance.</p>
