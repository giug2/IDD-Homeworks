<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm that has many attractive properties. In particular, FL caters to the growing trend that massive amount of the real-world data is generated at the edge devices, and the combination of growing storage and computational power of devices and the increasing concern over transmitting private information to a central server has made it attractive to store data and train ML models locally on each device. The power of FL has been realized in commercial devices (e.g., Pixel 2 uses FL to train ML models to personalize user experience) and ML tasks (e.g., Gboard uses FL for keyboard prediction) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite being recognized as one of the primary bottlenecks of FL since its inception <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, research on the communication aspect in the FL pipeline has not been on par with the learning component. Early research on communication-efficient FL largely focused on reducing the amount of information to be transmitted, and did not touch the actual communication algorithm and protocol design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. More recent research started to fill this void from a wireless communication and networking point of view <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In general, the principle is to balance learning performance and communication efficiency via, e.g., device selection, bandwidth allocation, and power control. It has been shown that combining (communication-oriented) adaptive resource allocation with (ML-oriented) efficient model representation leads to a better overall implementation, in particular for wireless federated learning which is envisioned to be among the mainstream deployment scenarios of edge ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While the early results demonstrate the potential of jointly optimizing communication and computation for wireless FL, the communication design has not been tailored to the unique characteristics of FL. In particular, an intrinsic and fundamental property of FL has largely been ignored: FL is a long-term process consisting of many progressive learning rounds that <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">collectively</span> determine the learning performance. Because of this progressive nature, learning rounds may have varying significance towards the convergence rate and final model accuracy, and thus should weigh differently when allocating communication resources. However, almost all existing works treat every learning round as equally important and perform resource allocation independently across learning rounds. Specifically, the common underlying assumptions made in these works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> include that, in every learning round, the same total bandwidth is available, the same (exact or average) number of mobile devices are selected, or the same energy constraints are imposed. Resource allocation is then performed within the round under these constraints. While this view of static resource allocation across time simplifies the problem, it may lead to inefficient utilization of the scarce communication resources and consequently degrade the FL performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We advocate a novel resource allocation framework for wireless FL, which we term <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">resource rationing</span> to emphasize balancing resources over time so that the long-term impact on the FL performance is explicitly captured. The fundamental principle that differentiates resource rationing from existing wireless resource allocation is the focus on allocating different resources across learning rounds (in addition to possible resource allocation within each round) to optimize the convergence of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. This novel framework originates from a holistic view of the resource management problem in FL: in order to achieve the best possible learning outcome with fast convergence, one has to “ration” the limited resources, consuming little at the beginning and gradually increasing towards the end. We introduce the basic concept of resource rationing and show that the <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">“later-is-better”</span> principle is general and applies to different resources in a wireless FL system. We also discuss several technical challenges and research directions to advance resource rationing and wireless FL in general.</p>

It works by iteratively executing the following steps: (1) the parameter server broadcasts the current global ML model to participating mobile devices (downlink communication); (2) Starting from the received global model, each device trains a local model using its own dataset (local computation); (3) mobile devices upload their updated local models to the parameter server (uplink communication); (4) the parameter server then aggregates these updates to generate a new global model (global computation). These four steps are collectively called a learning round. In this way, FL lets each mobile device evolve its own model using local data, while synchronizing the model training among different mobile devices via occasional model aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The primary drive for resource rationing is that FL is very different than most of the services for which current communication systems are designed. The purpose of communication in today’s system is to deliver the information bits efficiently and reliably from one point to another. Although this is still true for FL, the ultimate goal of communication is to facilitate machine learning (e.g., collaboratively training a neural network to achieve the best classification accuracy), which has its own characteristics. Thus, taking an isolated view of each individual communication phase and optimizing the resource allocation within each round, albeit still meaningful, misses the opportunity to allocate resource towards the ultimate prize – enabling fast convergence of ML training to an accurate model. This has motivated us to treat FL as a new class of service that has its own characteristics, and the problem we want to solve is how to <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">holistically</span> allocate the scarce wireless resource to optimize the particular service of FL.</p>

It is well known that the power of deep learning comes from the “depth” of the network and, correspondingly, significantly many weight coefficients. For example, the original ResNet-50 has over 23 million parameters. Even for the widely popular MobileNet which is specifically designed for devices with limited computing resource or limited power, the most economical version has 0.2 million parameters (<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">0.25 MobileNet-128</span> model, face attribute classification) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">One way to reduce the communication bandwidth is to compress the weights before each uplink and downlink communication round. Intuitively, the uplink communication is more resource constrained since the mobile devices are less powerful than the parameter server (e.g., base station). We thus focus on quantizing the locally updated weights and evaluating the performance impact to the overall FL convergence in a well adopted MNIST digit recognition task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To gain some insight into this question, we need to build an understanding of how FL works across learning rounds. Predominantly, FL tasks involve training a deep neural network (DNN) with (mini-batch) stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which uses a smaller number of data samples to calculate an approximated gradient for updating the model parameters. When data is further distributed among multiple clients, FL lets each client perform SGD using their local data with occasional synchronization by model averaging. A careful examination of the weight update and model averaging mechanisms for FL, e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, reveals an important feature that has not been incorporated in FL resource allocation: when the current weight is far from the optimal value, a rough gradient estimate is enough to find a descent direction. As the weight starts approaching the optimal solution, however, noisy gradient estimates frequently fail to produce descent directions and do not reliably decrease the objective. An illustration of this critical hypothesis is given in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-C “Later-Is-Better” ‣ II Resource Rationing for Wireless FL ‣ Resource Rationing for Wireless Federated Learning: Concept, Benefits, and Challenges" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, where early rounds enjoy much larger leeway (the large green area) in choosing gradient directions than later rounds (the small yellow area), where the same level of gradient noise may lead to deviation from convergence. This naturally leads to a “later-is-better” resource rationing rule: preserve resources at the early rounds of FL to exploit the tolerance of noisy gradient estimates, and spend the saved resources at later rounds to produce more accurate gradient estimate, thereby achieving an overall better learning performance.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of resource rationing is general and can be applied to a broad spectrum of resources whenever there is the flexibility to dynamically allocate them across learning rounds. In the physical layer, coding rate and modulation are another type of resource where we can attempt to develop novel adaptive coding and modulation methods to realize resource rationing. In addition, from a pure learning perspective, there is no difference whether the updated model or its other forms are communicated between the clients and the server. However, this choice would affect the communication efficiency. For example, transmitting only the model difference as opposed to the updated model itself reduces the dynamic range. How to combine this feature with bandwidth rationing is an interesting research problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. At the same time, the model difference becomes more sparse as the global model gradually converges. How to leverage the <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sparsity</span> in model difference for the communication design is another interesting problem. At the MAC layer, how to apply resource rationing to client selection, bandwidth allocation, power control, or a combination of them to accelerate learning convergence and model accuracy is worth exploring. Cross-layer designs can also be considered, e.g., one may be able to trade off coding and modulation for participating clients. These different aspects collectively form the backbone of resource rationing in FL, and will constitute a major technological breakthrough that advances future applications.</p>

Taking client selection in FL as an example, the selection space size is combinatorial with respect to the total number of clients. When there are many clients, searching for the optimal solution can be very difficult. To enable fast and effective resource rationing in large-scale wireless FL networks, designing low-complexity and/or distributed algorithms is essential. While pure optimization-based algorithms may still be worth exploring, it is interesting to leverage the generalization power of machine learning to develop a joint optimization and learning approach. A machine learning model may be trained on past resource rationing decisions and one can use this ML model to adjust future resource rationing.</p>

In addition, finding the optimal learning rate schedule also requires an expensive grid search over all possible parameter values. Can we avoid using a pre-determined decaying stepsize schedule but rather automatically adapt the stepsize in each learning round?

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we have argued for a new resource rationing framework for wireless federated learning. Resource rationing takes a holistic view of the resource allocation problem and attempts to balance the resource consumption across the entire learning period, with the goal of maximizing the final ML model accuracy and convergence rate. This intuition has led to an interesting “later-is-better” principle, where we have demonstrated with several examples that reserving resources at the beginning and spending them later is beneficial to the performance of FL. A theoretical intuition was also provided based on stochastic gradient descent. Future directions and challenges were presented to spark research activities. Philosophically, resource rationing represents an example of tailoring communication to the characteristics of FL, and other components of the communication system for wireless FL may similarly benefit from this holistic view.</p>
