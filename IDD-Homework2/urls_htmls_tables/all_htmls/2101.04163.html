<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In spite that Federated Learning (FL) is well known for its privacy protection when training machine learning models among distributed clients collaboratively, recent studies have pointed out that the naive FL is susceptible to gradient leakage attacks. In the meanwhile, Differential Privacy (DP) emerges as a promising countermeasure to defend against gradient leakage attacks. However, the adoption of DP by clients in FL may significantly jeopardize the model accuracy. It is still an open problem to understand the practicality of DP from a theoretic perspective. In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand the practicality of DP in FL through tuning the number of conducted iterations. Based on the FedAvg algorithm, we formally derive the convergence rate with DP noises in FL. Then, we theoretically derive: 1) the conditions for the DP based FedAvg to converge as the number of global iterations (GI) approaches infinity; 2) the method to set the number of local iterations (LI) to minimize the negative influence of DP noises. By further substituting the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms into the derived convergence rate respectively, we show that: 3) The DP based FedAvg with the Laplace mechanism cannot converge, but the divergence rate can be effectively prohibited by setting the number of LIs with our method; 4) The learning error of the DP based FedAvg with the Gaussian mechanism can converge to a constant number finally if we use a fixed number of LIs per GI.
To verify our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results not only validate our analysis results, but also provide useful guidelines on how to optimize model accuracy when incorporating DP into FL.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past decade, machine learning models have demonstrated unprecedented data processing capability in numerous applications. To well train machine learning models, it is unavoidable to massively collect data samples from users, which gives rise to the concern on user privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.

Raw data samples are locally kept on clients.

<p id="S1.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, the adoption of DP may lower the model accuracy significantly, which has become a major obstacle for the application of DP in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Taking the popular FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> as an example, the naive adoption of DP in FedAvg may cause <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">2</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">2</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">2</annotation></semantics></math>-<math id="S1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="10" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">10</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1">10</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1c">10</annotation></semantics></math> times training loss than the original model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. For many real-world applications, such high performance deterioration can significantly reduce the effectiveness of advanced machine learning models, and is somewhat unacceptable at all. As FedAvg represents a large family of gradient descent (GD) based algorithms widely used in FL, it is questionable how practical DP will be when being applied to FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, clients and the PS in FL works together with the following manner: clients conduct a number of local iterations (LI) before their gradients plus DP noises are uploaded to the PS for aggregation. By receiving the computations from multiple selected clients, the PS conducts a round of aggregation and distributes new results to clients for the next round of global iteration (GI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Apparently, it is only necessary to add the DP noises to clients’ gradients after the last round of LIs before they are disclosed to the PS. The noises distort the disclosed gradients against attacks, which meanwhile impair the convergence of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Note that clients may have different privacy budgets and are independent in noise generation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite></span></span></span></p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we investigate how to improve the practicality of DP in FL through tuning the number of conducted local or global iterations. Intuitively, we can improve the model accuracy if the number of LIs is tuned properly since there is no need to add noises after each LI except the last LI.
Firstly, we derive the convergence rate of the FedAvg algorithm distorted by the DP noises. Secondly, we derive the conditions for the DP based FedAvg to converge, and formally derive the formula to set the number of LIs according to the DP mechanism to minimize the negative influence of DP noises. At last,
we conduct case study by using the Laplace mechanism and the Gaussian mechanism, through which we theoretically unveil that: 1) The learning error of the DP based FedAvg with the Gaussian mechanism can finally converge to a constant number if we use a fixed number of LIs per GI; 2) The DP based FedAvg with the Laplace mechanism will diverge with the number of GIs, but the divergence rate can be lowered substantially by setting the number of LIs according to our method.</p>

Only the gradient descent algorithm is considered in this work, and its analysis proved that the GD algorithm can converge if the sample population approaches infinity, which however is impossible in practice. In addition, the scenario considered in this paper is not a typical FL setting, and the influence of the non-IID sample distribution is ignored.

Meanwhile, we note that the asymptotic variance of the Gaussian mechanism is lower than that of the Laplace mechanism, and therefore the Gaussian mechanism can yield a better convergence rate.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We investigate the practicability of DP mechanisms in FL. A general DP based FedAvg algorithm is presented first. Then, both the Laplace mechanism and the Gaussian mechanism are introduced into the general DP based FedAvg algorithm.
Through tuning the number of local/global iterations, we show from both theoretical analysis and experimental study that it is very important to set the number of iteration times properly such that the influence of the DP noises can be minimized. Specifically, via defining the asymptotic variance of the DP noises, we derive the conditions for DP-FedAvg to converge, and the optimal choice of the number of local iterations. The Lending Club and FEMNIST datasets are utilized to conduct extensive experiments. The experiment results not only verify our theoretical analysis, but also demonstrates that the choice of the number of local iterations can heavily affect the model training performance.</p>
