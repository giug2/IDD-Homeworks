<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is a crisis that affects all segments of the population.
As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is regarded as the most effective method to control the spreading.
Recent studies indicate that the city digital twin is beneficial to tackle this health crisis since it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors such as climate conditions, response operations, and people’s trajectory to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions.
However, the city digital twin system relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, which limited its advantages when facing urgent crisis like COVID-19.
Federated Learning (FL), where all the clients can learn a shared model while keeping all the training data locally, emerges as a promising solution to accumulate the insights from multiple data source efficiently.
Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings break the privacy barriers lies in such collaboration.
In this work, we propose a collaborative city digital twin based on FL, a novel paradigm that allowing multiple city DT to share the local strategy and status in a timely manner.
In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DT), provides a global model which is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems, until the model gains the correlations between various response plan and infection trend.
That means, a collaborative city DT paradigm based on FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs, and eventually establish a ‘global view’ for city crisis management.
Meanwhile, it also helps to improve each city digital twin selves by consolidating other DT’s respective data without violating privacy rules.
To validate the proposed solution, we take COVID-19 pandemic as a case study.
The experimental results on the real dataset with various response plan validate our proposed solution and demonstrate the superior performance.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus was identified in 2019<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, December 31th<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019</span></span></span>.
The virus has spread worldwide in less than three months, but infected more than 5.7 million people around the world and caused over 844,000 deaths<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</span></span></span>.
This novel coronavirus outbreak leads to severe illness and deaths in both younger and middle-aged adults, and it also critically affect people’s daily lives.
For example, almost 500 million schoolchildren have been cut off from learning recently for avoiding direct exposure to this disease; thousands of people canceled their trips to reduce the risks of potential infection, etc.
So far, there is still no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Fortunately, we observe that various active response plans have a clear positive effect upon preventing transmission from one person to another.
One of the successful examples is in South Korea<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>https://ourworldindata.org/covid-exemplar-south-korea</span></span></span>. Vt taking early, aggressive government response including establishing a large number of detection sites, isolating the infected patients in a very short time, and tracing contacts for searching the potential infected people with thoroughness, South Korea controlled the spreading efficiently.
Thus, we observed that South Korea has quickly flattened the epidemic curve after its first peak in February 2020, and the daily cases declined to nearly zero after two months.
The similar observation can also be found in many other countries, such as China, Germany and the United Kingdom.
That means, if we response appropriately, the infection spreading can be effectively controlled.
Consequently, it is necessary to establish a paradigm to collect the historical data, and distinguish the effectiveness of various response plans.
We also expect that such a paradigm could be used for other urgent city crisis.
To obtain the above goal, city Digital Twin (city DT) has demonstrated a remarkable potential to offer the function of data collection, in-depth analysis and most important, it operationalizes real-world insights to asset performance and refine future actions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In particular, a city digital twin is a virtual replica of the city that can provide digital view of city facilities, human activities and behavior, and other types of information about urban area.
By keep interacting with the target environment, a city digital twin not only could automatically learn the patterns and generate useful insights from the historical data, but also continuously improve itself by verifying the automatic operations within the real world.
Eventually, a city DT enables interdisciplinary convergence in multiple aspects of city informatics, and offers increased visibility and machine intelligence for both human assisted decisions and automatic operations to facilitate city government and planners’ decision-making.
Several successful attempts, including Columbus Consolidated Government (Columbus), Digital Twin City of Atlanta, and Virtual Singapore, validate city digital twin’s value for capture the complex spatial and temporal implications among multiple data source to optimize urban sustainability on traffic management, architectural planning and energy saving solutions.
Meanwhile, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposed a novel framework of disaster city digital twin with deep learning techniques, which presents the visions for a city DT based disaster management and further explains the advantages to response the disaster and crisis.
Thus, we expect that the city DT could be a promising solution to tackle current health crisis by simulating various response plan in this virtual system, and finally determine the proper actions to control the infection trend.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Note that, when we aim to construct a city digital twin to model COVID-19 pandemic and generate the prediction of a specified response plan, we need to resolve the data sparsity challenge with considerations of privacy by following reasons.
First, a city digital twin for health crisis like COVID-19 may contain more sensitive information than other application scenarios, which imply the pressing need for privacy protection on the raw data.
Second, as each city constructing its own digital twin system, which means it could form an isolated data island.
Under such conditions, each city can only depend on a trail-error manner to control the pandemic instead of learning experience from others, which may result in delayed response or inappropriate operations.
To resolve such problems, a collaborative city digital twin paradigm can be beneficial to alleviate the data sparsity issue.
Meanwhile, it is also helpful on pursuing an accurate prediction for choosing a better response plan.
To this definitive end, we need to answer three primary questions:
(1) How to find a collaborative plan that can enhance the prediction results while not disturbing the interactions between city digital twin systems and the physical environment?
(2) How to ensure the collaborative solution can automatically generate different insights to adapt to different city digital twin system?
(3) How to provide the collaborative city digital twin paradigm with privacy protection guarantee?
A straightforward solution is the distributed machine learning method with privacy protection guarantee, so that various city digital twin can upload their raw data to the central server to achieve a learning result based on data fusion results.
However, the initiative data pre-processing stage of this plan could bring extra time expenses, and the centralized training manner is likely to have higher risks on privacy leakage and security issues.</p>

In particular, each city digital twin is a client in our FL paradigm.
Each client uses a Sequence2sequence (Seq2seq) model to generate the local forecasting model by historical conditions of COVID-19 in targeted area.
Multiple city DTs can cooperatively train a shared model on FL platform, only with local updates without exchanging the raw data.
That is, each city DT can be improved by both local data and external insights from other city DTs to make more efficient response operations.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Historical insights for understanding the character of different epidemics and the prediction of spreading trends have been crucially crucial for epidemic control and prevention.
Several past studies applied artificial intelligence based models to these highly specialized domains and observed impressive multi-functional properties, such as the deep neural network based short-term and high-resolution epidemic forecasting for influenza-like illness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>,
the semi-supervised deep learning framework that integrates computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques for epidemic simulation called SimNest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and EpiRP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>
that using representational learning methods to capture the dynamic characteristics of epidemic spreading on social networks for epidemics-oriented clustering and classification.
To appreciate why deep learning techniques are required, in this section, we briefly review several recent relevant works and their contributions in artificial intelligence-based urban epidemic control.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Deep Learning based Epidemic Control</span>:
For the past decade, deep learning technique has been used in a variety of smart health areas, including disease prevention and monitoring, intelligent diagnosis and treatment systems, and health decision-making.
Recent breakthroughs in various disease modeling, forecasting, and real-time disease surveillance have convinced us that those applications mitigate the effects of disease outbreaks.
Given various application scenarios and objectives, deep learning based models can be different:
A typical solution for localized flu nowcasting and flu activity inferring is ARGONet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>,
which is a network-based approach leveraging spatio-temporal correlations across different states to improve the prediction accuracy.
Based on the information from influenza-related Google search frequencies, electronic health records, and historical influenza trends, ARGONet uses a spatial network to capture the spatio-temporal correlations across different states and produces more precise retrospective estimates.
Instead of leveraging multiple data source like ARGONet, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> proposes a multi-task learning based model that only using user-generated content (Web search data).
They investigate both linear and nonlinear models’ capability and find they can improve the disease rate estimates significantly in the case study of influenza-like illness.
These successful attempts, however, are based on large scale data sources or plenty historical information of the disease with similar spreading patterns.
That means, high-dimensionality, irregularity forms, noise, or sparsity problems are possible to affect these learning-based models’ performance.
Such problems would be more serious when the smart health system needs to deal with unexpected infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19, due to limited historical data and information.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">City Digital Twin</span>:
For most of deep learning based applications, the performance depends on the interaction with the physical world to generate data with high quality.
To fill the data gap, digital twin is proposed as a virtual representation of a device or a specific application scenario, which can interact with the target environment to collect data continuously for real-time decision making.
Such a concept leads to the advancements in both urban computing paradigm and IoT applications direct extending to smart city area recently, which termed as ‘city digital twin’.
It is a digital model of the physical urban environment, which collects information by hundreds of IoT devices or public databases. It provides remote decision making and real-time insights about the physical asset’s performance by utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques.
It also serves as an essential role in addressing public health, urban planning, and environmental issues.
The data streaming in the city digital twin model enables proactive remote monitoring to identify patterns and risks that foreshadow specific impending issues.
Several successful research attempts including disaster city digital twin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, energy management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, and city-scale Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, Singapore <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and Germany <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> has launched the city-scale digital twin to monitor and improve utilities, which enhance the transparency, sustainability and availability of DT.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning</span>:
Pandemic control and response are the significant challenges in the field of urban computing.
However, recent research on digital twin is designed for the city resource management for a single urban area, and such application scenario often has enough historical data and multiple resources.
Unfortunately, the data resource could be the most challenging requirement for DT aiming at pandemic control, especially the unexpected contagious disease like COVID-19 due to lacking enough experience and information.
To maintain the advantages of DT and tolerate the data sparsity challenge, federated learning that allows multiple stack-holders sharing data and training global model has become a preferred scheme.
In the typical FL scheme settings, each data owner (FL client) engages in a collaborative training process without transferring the raw data to the others.
Through FL, the central server manages each client’s local training updates and aggregates their contributions to enhance the global model’s performance.
Several concrete scenarios include Google’s Gboard, health AI and smart banking showing the advantages of federated learning in handling collaborative training issues and data difficulties among diverse data owners.
Therefore, we are motivated to utilize federated learning techniques to resolve the data sparsity challenges and design a collaborative city digital twin for COVID-19 pandemic control.</p>

The response plan includes 14 day quarantine, domestic travel limitations, gatherings limits and stay at home, nonessential business closures, reopening plans, mask policy, etc.
The effectiveness of different response plan can be varied, since it is may be affected by several external factor, such as a crowd gathers, adverse weather conditions or using vaccines.</p>

For our proposed DT system, the primary goal is to analyze the specific response plan, determine whether the historical plan will impact the future infection trend, to estimate the possible plan effects.
In the process of building such a virtual replica for the COVID-19 pandemic control, we observe the temporal effects is a critical factor when we aim to provide useful guidance on response plan selection.
These temporal effects can be considered two types in our proposed DT system: temporal effects of historical infection numbers and selected response plans.</p>

The historical infection numbers are direct evidence to describe the correlation between past conditions and current infection status.
In Fig <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A System Model ‣ III Preliminary ‣ Collaborative City Digital Twin For Covid-19 Pandemic: A Federated Learning Solution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we take historical daily case information of three states (NV: Nevada, UT: Utah, WI: Wisconsin) as examples to illustrate the temporal effects of multiple factors.
From the data of early March from three states, we observe an immediate impact of historical infection numbers since it leads to a continuously increasing number of infections until April 2nd, 2020.
Such correlations play quite an essential role in explaining and predicting future infection trends.</p>

The choice of a specified response operation can also significantly impacts the number of infection.
This impact could be immediate or delayed, which may depend on the strictness of that operation or people’s acceptance.
For example, in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-A System Model ‣ III Preliminary ‣ Collaborative City Digital Twin For Covid-19 Pandemic: A Federated Learning Solution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we observe that after taking a specified response plan, such as domestic travel limitations or gathering limits, the infection trend is decreased in the next several days.
Such impact could be complicated, since the 14-day time window, the time that a response plan starts to take effect, and paroxysmal public crisis may also lead to some impact on infection trends.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">With the definite goal of making the COVID-19 pandemic under control, different local agencies in each city/region may choose their own strategy to meet their local requirements.
Such divergence is mainly caused by the fact that different cities could have other conditions or expectations so that the local agency tends to provide a different response plan considering several local intrinsic properties.
For instance, area <math id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">A</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐴</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">A</annotation></semantics></math>, which is a thinly populated district with very low infection rates, would prefer to choose less radical response plan; while the another area <math id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="B" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">B</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐵</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">B</annotation></semantics></math>, where has more serious infection conditions, is very likely to choose a more strict response plan like restricting activities and closing facilities.
Obviously, such unsynchronized operations present obstacles to accumulating knowledge about providing accurate response guidance, since each city forms an isolated data island.
Furthermore, COVID-19, as an infectious disease with unknown cause, has exaggerated the situation due to lacking enough historical information and experience for dealing with the new virus.
That means, each city can only obtain knowledge by trial-and-error operation schemes for seeking an effective response plan, and the increasing time cost may lead to a delayed policy with poor performance.
To resolve the above difficulties, we formalize this problem as a FL training problem using the FL approach to resolve the data sparsity challenge in city digital twin construction.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present our proposed method utilizing FL as the collaborative platform for predicting a response plan’s effectiveness, with considerations of temporal patterns and external factor impacts.
Specifically, we describe the baseline model using Seq2seq structure, and give the details of the proposed federated training process to help understand how every single city DT can be automatically improved by such collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A typical city digital twin actively collects real-time data from infrastructure and human systems to obtain automatic decision making or possible future behavior predictions.
Hence, it is beneficial for tracking the progress of the infectious disease in real-time and accumulating information and knowledge at city scale.
However, COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus with incredible spreading speed, which means the city DT faces the challenge of making effective operations with very limited response time.
Under such circumstances, single city DT likely lacks experience to determine a well strategic preparedness and response plan quickly since each city DT has limited number of actions and observations.
Thus, we introduce FL as the primary solution to implement a collaborative training process, enabling multiple city DTs to train a global model for response operation prediction collaboratively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning is a novel distributed learning framework with a privacy protection guarantee.
Unlike previous research dealing with training data in a centralized manner, FL uses a parameter only concept to avoid disturbing each collaborator’s privacy rules.
Thus, multiple collaborators can learn a common model as partners while preserving personal data on their own devices.
In particular, for a new FL training task, (1) the FL central server would train a global model for initialization, then distributed this model to the existing collaborators (clients); (2) after receiving the global model, each collaborator use the local dataset to update the local parameter and generates the local updates; (3) based on specified synchronization settings, all these updates are back to the FL central server for aggregation, and the global model is improved; (4) such distributed updates iteration are repeated until the global model converges or achieve expected performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From the above facts, we observe clear advantages of utilizing FL for establishing the collaborative city DTs framework: (i) by the separation of local model training and global model updates, FL offers a strong capability to deal with the isolated data island problem between multiple DTs; (ii) with enhanced privacy settings, each city DT can obtain the collaboration achievements without violating its privacy rules.</p>

(2) joint-renewal mode by global updates: our proposed FL framework offers a platform for all City DTs with willingness for sharing its experience and insights. By such collaboration, the single city DT can gather information from others to update the local model, which we regard as a joint-renewal mode in this paper.
Specifically, our works aim to simulate a response operation’s performance for guiding choosing an appropriate response plan of COVID-19.</p>

The COVID tracking project dataset contains each state’s daily epidemic data from the first case in the United States from January, 2020 to July, 2020, including information on the number of nucleic acid tests, the number of confirmed cases, and the number of severe cases.
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) State Actions Dataset mainly contains specific information about the policies adopted by various states in the United States during the epidemic, including the policy’s name, the start time, and the end time.
In this paper, we also need to consider other external factors, such as the change in the number of infections in each state in a time zone, the implementation of various response operations, etc.
Therefore, we combine the two data sets for our model training.

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-C Federated Training Process: Collaborative City Digital Twin ‣ IV Exploring the Collaborative Framework For City Digital Twin ‣ Collaborative City Digital Twin For Covid-19 Pandemic: A Federated Learning Solution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we show the comparison results of our federated solution and non-federated solution.
It shows the difference of the loss value of both of the two models in 22 states, each using the individual training method and federated learning method.
For our federated learning model, FedAvg is adopted as the aggregation algorithm, due to the considerations of saving communication resource.
The selected response operation includes domestic travel limitations, gatherings limits and stay at home, nonessential business closures, reopening plans and task forces, statewide mask policy.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-C Federated Training Process: Collaborative City Digital Twin ‣ IV Exploring the Collaborative Framework For City Digital Twin ‣ Collaborative City Digital Twin For Covid-19 Pandemic: A Federated Learning Solution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, in most states, the loss of epidemic prediction of FL training is much less than that of single DT models.
This indicates that through FL training, each city DT can exchange the epidemic information of their own city to improve their DT model, so that the prediction performance for COVID-19 trend under selected response operations maintains at a relatively high value.</p>

The steel-blue line of each city DT in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-C Federated Training Process: Collaborative City Digital Twin ‣ IV Exploring the Collaborative Framework For City Digital Twin ‣ Collaborative City Digital Twin For Covid-19 Pandemic: A Federated Learning Solution" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> represents the loss value of the prediction result based on single DT model that only rely on its own dataset, so that it will not change with the number of participating FL members.
The dark-orange curve shows the loss value of the city DT model that training in the FL environment.
When the number of people participating in the FL platform is increasing, it can be observed the performance has been gradually enhanced, since the information obtained by DT in each city has gradually accumulated.
Under such conditions, the prediction results have become more accurate.
Thus, the experimental results show that increasing the number of FL clients can effectively improve the training effect and reduce the prediction error of each single city DT.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative city digital twin framework based on federated learning techniques for COVID-19 response plan management, with Seq2seq structure to better capture temporal contexts in historical infection data.
The proposed framework shows that the collaborative learning of multiple city digital twin is beneficial for alleviating the data sparsity challenge, especially when the novel coronavirus management needs more data sources and highly strict privacy protection requirements.
Besides, the experiments validate our approach achieves better performance on the real dataset.
In the future, we aim to involve more data sources (e.g., movement of people, seasonal changes, temperature, and humidity) to improve the performance of the proposed framework.</p>
