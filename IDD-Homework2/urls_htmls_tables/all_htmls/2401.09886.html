<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Edge caching is a promising solution for next-generation networks by empowering caching units in small-cell base stations (SBSs), which allows user equipments (UEs) to fetch users’ requested contents that have been pre-cached in SBSs. It is crucial for SBSs to predict accurate popular contents through learning while protecting users’ personal information. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect users’ privacy but the data discrepancies among UEs can lead to a degradation in model quality. Therefore, it is necessary to train personalized local models for each UE to predict popular contents accurately. In addition, the cached contents can be shared among adjacent SBSs in next-generation networks, thus caching predicted popular contents in different SBSs may affect the cost to fetch contents. Hence, it is critical to determine where the popular contents are cached cooperatively. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative edge caching scheme based on elastic federated and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CEFMR) to optimize the cost in the network. We first propose an elastic FL algorithm to train the personalized model for each UE, where adversarial autoencoder (AAE) model is adopted for training to improve the prediction accuracy, then a popular content prediction algorithm is proposed to predict the popular contents for each SBS based on the trained AAE model. Finally, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based algorithm to decide where the predicted popular contents are collaboratively cached among SBSs. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme to existing baseline caching schemes.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, with the increasing popularity of smart devices, we have witnessed an unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic, which has imposed a heavy burden on wireless networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. As users increasingly rely on user equipment (UEs) like mobile devices and home routers to access content from wireless networks, it becomes challenging for ensuring a satisfactory quality of service to meet their demands.
To address this challenge, edge caching has emerged as a promising solution for next-generation networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Through the implementation of caching units in wireless edge nodes, such as small-cell base stations (SBSs), UEs can fetch users’ desired contents from nearby SBSs instead of remote servers or cloud. This process significantly reduces traffic load, alleviates network congestion, reduces latency and improves system performance<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To efficiently enable UEs to fetch users’ desired contents from SBSs, SBSs need to predict popular contents based on the interests of users within their coverage area and proactively cache these popular contents in advance.
Due to the unique preference of each user, the popular contents cached in different SBSs may exhibit surprising variations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Machine learning (ML) can overcome this issue by training based on users’ data to extract hidden features, thereby effectively predicting popular contents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
However, most traditional ML algorithms need to train and analyze the data generated by users, which may involve personal sensitive information.
Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a potential solution that can protect the privacy and security of users’ data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
For the traditional FL, each UE trains its local model based on its users’ data, and then only uploads the trained local model to the local SBS instead of its training data. Then the local SBS aggregates the uploaded models from UEs to update the global model.
However, traditional FL tends to generalize user preferences, neglecting the personalized patterns of individual UEs. This general approach may not cater to the specific needs and behaviors of individual UEs, leading to potential inefficiencies in someway. To address this limitation, we introduce the elastic FL algorithm which adjusts the learning process dynamically based on the unique characteristics of each UE. By assigning specific weights to each local model based on differences between the global and local models, one can capture users’ individual characteristics<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. This elastic adjustment ensures that the final model is both globally informed and locally sensitive. This dual feature significantly enhances both prediction accuracy and caching hit ratios in edge caching scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">After each local SBS has predicted the popular contents, deploying edge caches poses an additional challenge. Current caching methods in wireless networks often worked separately. Each SBS decides where to cache contents based on certain criteria. While there have been efforts to study collaborative caching, there is still a lack of research in making caching decisions among SBSs based on popular contents.
In next-generation networks, the importance of collaborative caching is further strengthened. Here, cached contents can be shared among adjacent SBSs via the Xn interface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. This allows UEs to indirectly obtain the requested contents from the adjacent SBSs even if they cannot directly fetch the requested contents from the local SBS. However, the number of predicted popular contents for each SBS is usually larger than the limited cache capacity of the SBS. Therefore, this requires cooperation between SBSs to cache popular contents. Additionally, the placement of these popular contents in the right SBSs is also critical, as it directly impacts the cost of fetching contents across the network. In addition, the dimensions of caching decision will increase with the number of SBSs and cached contents, inevitably adding complexity to the caching problem in the entire network. This makes it challenging to coordinate caching among SBSs to reduce the cost for fetching contents in the next-generation network.
Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADRL) is a suitable method that can overcome the above problem, and has begun to be used in cooperative edge caching. Instead of the traditional way of making separate decisions, MADRL promotes cooperation among SBSs. Each SBS, which is considered an agent, does not just decide where to cache popular contents based on its own prediction. Instead, it should work together with other SBSs, taking into account their decisions to create a network-wide caching strategy driven by content popularity. If some UEs’ demands change, MADRL can adjust the caching decisions. This adaptability is crucial for handling the increased complexity that comes with the growing caching needs in the next-generation network.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first review some current existing works on content caching schemes based on the MADRL algorithm.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, Araf <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> employed a multi-agent actor-critic reinforcement learning approach, combined with UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) assistance, to tackle the problem of optimizing cooperative caching strategies on the network edge.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, Chen <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed a multi-agent actor-critic framework with variational recurrent neural networks (VRNN) to estimate content popularity. Through multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, the cooperative edge caching algorithm substantially improved the benefits of edge caches in ultra-dense next-generation networks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, Jiang <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> employed multi-agent reinforcement learning to design content caching strategies in mobile device-to-device (D2D) networks, addressing the challenge of content caching without prior knowledge of popularity distribution. The proposed approach, using Q-learning, maximized caching rewards by treating users as agents and caching decisions as actions.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, Wu <span id="S2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed the integration of cooperative coded caching using maximum distance separable (MDS) codes in small cell networks to alleviate traffic loads. To adapt to dynamic and unknown content popularity, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework was introduced to intelligently update cached content, with a focus on minimizing long-term expected front-haul traffic loads, resulting in improved caching efficiency.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, Zhong <span id="S2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> investigated cache placement by using the collaborative MADRL algorithm in ultra-dense small cell networks (SCNs) to maximize cache hit rates in centralized and decentralized scenario settings.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Jiang <span id="S2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> explored edge caching for the internet of vehicles (IoVs) using distributed MARL. They introduced a hierarchical caching architecture to minimize content delivery overhead, extended single-agent reinforcement learning to a multi-agent system, and achieved superior performance in comparison to other caching strategies through simulation results.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, Song <span id="S2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> addressed the content caching and sharing problem in cooperative base stations while considering unknown content popularity distribution and content retrieval costs. This paper formulated the problem as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) learning problem, jointly optimizing caching and sharing strategies. Two algorithms, a centralized approach using semidefinite relaxation and a decentralized approach based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), were proposed to solve the problem efficiently.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, Cai <span id="S2.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> proposed a cross-tier cooperative caching architecture for all content that allows distributed cache nodes to cooperate, using a MADRL approach to model the decision process between heterogeneous cache nodes.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, Wang <span id="S2.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> introduced an intelligent edge caching framework named MacoCache, which incorporated MADRL to enhance edge caching performance in distributed environments. By employing the advanced actor-critic method and integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) for time series dynamics, MacoCache successfully reduced latency by an average of 21% and costs by 26% compared to existing learning-based caching solutions.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, Chen <span id="S2.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> utilized a refined MADRL tailored for the 5G network structure to improve scalable video coding (SVC)-based caching and video quality service strategies. The introduced value-decomposed dimensional network (VDDN) algorithm and a dimension decomposition method in the dueling deep Q-network addressed the challenges of large action spaces and computational efficiency.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, Zhang <span id="S2.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> introduced an edge caching model for IoV content distribution, allowing vehicles to collaboratively cache content and account for varying content popularity and channel conditions. An autonomous decision-making approach, an edge caching approach for the IoV based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, was proposed where vehicles act as agents to optimize caching decisions.
However, the above works predominantly relied on the direct application of MADRL for content caching challenges. It is worth noting that these works did not particularly emphasize the complex challenges related to content prediction, especially the prediction of content popularity and training with machine learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, there have been several works on designing content caching schemes based on MADRL and FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, Chang <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> introduced a federated multi-agent reinforcement Learning (FMRL) method for optimizing edge caching. Using a Markov decision process (MDP) and a specialized regression model, it predicted content popularity, improved server rewards, and optimized cache decision-making. An enhanced FL technique aggregated local models, improving training and preserving user privacy.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, Prathiba <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> introduced the federated Learning and edge cache-assisted Cybertwin framework in response to rising autonomous vehicle (AV) technology and mobile traffic. This framework integrated the cybertwin concept to merge physical and digital systems. It employed the federated MADRL algorithm for optimized learning, considering various factors. Additionally, the federated reinforcement learning-based edge caching algorithm was used for efficient caching in 6G vehicle-to-everything networks.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, Sun <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> employed FL to perceive user preferences across various districts without exposing user requests. A content blocks-based RL is utilized for intelligent caching, taking into account the receiving scenarios of AVs. By integrating FL with MARL, this paper achieved distributed training of local models, which not only reduced the state-action space dimension but also circumvented local optimal solutions.
However, the above works did not consider the personalization of each UE in FL training and the popular contents for different SBSs.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">

Each UE randomly selects a portion of local data to establish a training set, and the remaining data is utilized as a test set.
The CS is linked to the core network by a backhaul link, and it stores all contents that users can request. Each SBS is connected to the CS through a backhaul link connected by the next-generation (NG) interface. SBSs are deployed at the network edge close to the UEs.
The time duration is divided into time slots. In each time slot, each UE collects contents that users want to request and generates a requested information. This requested information may be a small-sized list containing the contents labels which users desire. Therefore, the requested information will not occupy too much resources. Then UEs send these requested information to their local SBSs to fetch the requested contents.
The cache capacity of a single SBS is actually very limited, the adjacent SBSs can share cached contents with each other through a wired-link connected by the Xn interface. Hence, a UE can fetch a requested content from the local SBS, adjacent SBSs or CS. Specifically,</p>

<p id="S3.SS0.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to enable UEs within the coverage of each SBS to fetch requested contents more effectively, each SBS needs to accurately predict the popular contents. These popular contents are predicted based on users’ ratings for the contents. However, it is difficult to distinguish whether the user is interested in this content or has requested it before if a rating for one content is 0. Therefore, it is necessary to predict and reconstruct the ratings of each content. The AAE model can effectively extract hidden features of ratings and reconstruct the ratings for each content. Hence the reconstructed ratings will contain fewer <math id="S3.SS0.SSS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS0.SSS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S3.SS0.SSS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS0.SSS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS0.SSS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS0.SSS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS0.SSS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">0</cn></annotation-xml></semantics></math>. This helps to predict the popular contents more accurately. Thus the AAE model is adopted as the local model and global model in the FL algorithm and the popular contents for each SBS are predicted based on the trained AAE model. The proposed CEFMR scheme is described as follows. We first propose an elastic FL algorithm which can assign specific weight for each local model based on the differences between the global model and local model to train the personalized local model for each UE. Then we propose a popular content prediction algorithm to predict the popular contents for each SBS based on the trained AAE model. Finally, due to the limited cache capacity of each SBS, we construct a MADRL framework and then adopt the MADDPG algorithm to decide where the predicted popular contents are collaboratively cached among SBSs to reduce the cost for fetching contents. We will elaborate the CEFMR scheme in the next section. The main notations are listed in Table I.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since each SBS has limited caching capacity, it is crucial for SBSs to collaborate in caching the predicted popular contents in order to reduce the cost for fetching contents. Therefore, we proposed the MADDPG algorithm for cooperative edge caching among SBSs, deciding SBS to cache suitable predicted popular contents, thus the cost can be optimized.
Next, the MADRL framework is first formulated, which is the basis of the MADDPG algorithm. Then, the MADDPG algorithm will be introduced.</p>

All agents share two centralized global critic networks and two global target critic networks, all of them are located at CS.
Two global critic networks provide a global perspective based on the global states and actions of all agents, enabling each agent to understand and adapt to the global environment. Two global target critic networks which have the same network structure as the global critic networks, respectively, are also used to ensure the stability.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we will analyze the computational complexity of our approach. The analysis focuses on the training stage due to the significant computation resource and time consumption in the training stage. Our methodology for analyzing the computational complexity is inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
During a round, the training process includes two processes: the elastic FL training of AAE and the training of MADDPG. Because the training process requires significant computational resources to calculate gradients and update parameters, the computational complexity mainly consists of the complexity of computing gradients and the complexity of updating parameters.</p>

The loss represents the error between the action-state value and the actual reward, thus the action-state value gradually approaches the actual reward with the progress of training the loss decreases. This means that MADDPG algorithm converges after training, and we can obtain an optimal local actor network for each SBS.
It should be noted that the number of UEs will only affect the speed of elastic FL training and does not impact MADDPG. Additionally, the primary objective of this paper is to address the cooperative caching challenges among multiple MBSs. As a result, to maintain focus and ensure a controlled environment for our analysis, we set a fixed number of UEs during the training of elastic FL. Research on dynamic UE numbers has been explored in our previous work<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.</p>

It can be seen that all the weight distances tend to decrease as round increases. After a certain number of rounds, all the weight distances converge. This is because as the training of elastic FL, both UEs’ local models and global model gradually converge, and the local models are trained based on the downloaded global model, the divergence between local models and global model will gradually decrease. It also can be seen that all weight distances do not reduce to zero after convergence. This is because the data among UEs are diverse, thus the models trained locally by UEs maintain their own characteristics.</p>

It can be seen that the costs of all schemes decrease as the cache capacity increases, and the cache hit ratios increase as the cache capacity increases.
This is because all SBSs which have larger caching capacities can cache more contents. As a result, UEs can more easily fetch their requested contents from SBSs. This can alleviate the pressure on the CS and improve the caching performance of the system.
The Random and Thompson Sampling schemes have poor performance. This is because these schemes do not cache contents based on predicting content popularity, while other five schemes determine the cached contents based on the predicted interested contents uploaded by the UEs within the coverage of SBS. Both CEFMR and TFMADRL schemes outperform EFNRL, BSG, and C-<math id="S5.SS3.p4.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\varepsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p4.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S5.SS3.p4.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p4.3.m3.1.1.cmml">ε</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p4.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S5.SS3.p4.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p4.3.m3.1.1">𝜀</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p4.3.m3.1c">\varepsilon</annotation></semantics></math>-greedy schemes. This is because CEFMR and TFMADRL schemes employ cooperative caching using the MADDPG method. CEFMR and TFMADRL schemes also outperform BSG scheme because they utilize a more efficient AAE model for popularity prediction. Furthermore, from the figure, it can be observed that as cache capacity increases, CEFMR scheme gradually outperforms TFMADRL scheme. This is because CEFMR scheme employs elastic federated learning to train the AAE, which allows individual UE’s personalized models to better reflect their own data. This means that for each UE, the personalized AAE model is more likely to provide more accurate predictions of content popularity. When the SBS’s cache capacity increases, more accurate predictions can help cache more suitable content, thereby increasing cache hit rates and reducing costs.</p>

It can be seen that the performance of the MADDPG tends to be smooth in different testing episodes, which demonstrates the stability of the algorithm. From these figures, it can also be seen that cost decreases as cache capacity increases, while reward and cache hit ratio increase as cache capacity increases. This is because as the cache capacity increases, SBS can cache more contents requested by UEs, and UEs can fetch more contents from the local SBS, thereby improving the cache hit rate. Moreover, as cache capacity increases, UEs can fetch more contents from the local SBSs or from adjacent SBSs, instead of fetching them from CS. Therefore, increasing cache capacity can reduce cost and increase the saved cost, i.e., the reward.</p>

This is because the CEFMR scheme has become a single-agent scheme. The local SBS cannot obtain requested contents from the adjacent SBSs, thus the UEs can only fetch the requested contents from the local SBS or CS with a higher cost.
As the number of SBSs increases, the CEFMR scheme generally performs better in terms of cost, reward, and cache hit ratio. This is because more SBSs can cooperate to cache popular contents.It also indicates the effectiveness of the CEFMR scheme in coordinating edge caching.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a cooperative edge caching scheme named CEFMR to optimize the cost to fetch contents in next-generation networks. We first proposed an elastic FL algorithm to train the personalized model for each UE, where the AAE model was adopted for training to improve the prediction accuracy, then a popular content prediction algorithm was proposed to predict the popular contents for each SBS based on the trained AAE model. Finally, we proposed a MADRL based algorithm to decide where the predicted popular contents are collaboratively cached among SBSs to reduce the cost for fetching contents. Our experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our proposed scheme to existing baseline caching schemes. The conclusions are summarized as follows:</p>

<p id="S6.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">CEFMR’s ability to extract hidden features from the local data of UEs significantly outperforms baseline schemes in predicting popular content for caching. Unlike other schemes, CEFMR’s personalized approach personalizes predictions to the specific usage patterns and preferences of each UE. This leads to a more accurate and efficient caching process, as evidenced by a comparison without AAE model, which shows the improvements in the cache hit ratio.</p>
