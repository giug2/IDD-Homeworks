<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an effective learning paradigm for distributed computation owing to its strong potential
in capturing underlying data statistics while preserving data privacy. However, in cases of practical data heterogeneity among
FL clients, existing FL frameworks still exhibit deficiency in capturing the overall feature properties of local client data
that exhibit disparate distributions. In response, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently been exploited in FL to address data heterogeneity since GANs can be integrated for data
regeneration without exposing original raw data. Despite some successes, existing GAN-related FL frameworks often incur heavy communication cost and also elicit other privacy concerns, which limit their applications in real scenarios. To this end, this
work proposes a novel FL framework that requires only
partial GAN model sharing. Named as <span id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PS-FedGAN</span>,
this new framework enhances the GAN releasing and training mechanism to address heterogeneous data distributions
across clients and to strengthen privacy preservation at
reduced communication cost, especially over wireless networks.
Our analysis demonstrates the convergence and privacy benefits
of the proposed PS-FEdGAN framework. Through experimental results based on several well-known benchmark datasets, our proposed PS-FedGAN shows great promise to tackle FL under non-IID client data distributions, while securing data privacy and lowering communication overhead.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) presents an exciting framework for distributed and collaborative learning while preserving users’ data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Konečný et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. As an emerging field of artificial intelligence, the
full potential of FL requires us to effectively address a myriad of challenges,
including heterogeneity of data distribution, data privacy consideration, and communication efficiency.
Among many existing FL schemes to handle data heterogeneity, generative adversarial networks (GANs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Goodfellow et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> based approaches have recently drawn substantial interest owing to their ability to regenerate data statistics without sharing raw data. Despite much success, GAN-based FL is also prone to several shortcomings, such as poor privacy protection and heavy communication redundancies, caused by full model or synthetic data sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>); Xin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many studies such as  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Lyu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> have shown that traditional FL methods may be vulnerable and can cause sensitive information leakage. Similar concerns happen in GAN-based FL.
As discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hitaj et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, releasing GAN or synthetic data may lead to critical privacy issues.
Specifically, GANs are prone to reconstruction attacks and membership inference attacks, where an attacker aims to regenerate data samples and check the usage of a certain data sample  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hayes et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, respectively.
To address related privacy concerns, differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dwork (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite> has been studied in GAN-based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite>. However, the major drawback of DP is the tradeoff between privacy and utility where a privacy budget is introduced to balance performance and privacy. Thus,
to leverage the performance of downstream tasks, an infinite privacy budget is often picked,
thereby providing no privacy. On the other hand, GAN-based FL also suffers from communication inefficiency
due to the large size of shared models and limited communication resources in many realistic networking
scenarios. We provide a more detailed literature review in the Appendix in view of the page limit.</p>

Through our proposed FL framework, named as <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PS-FedGAN</span>, we reconstruct separate generators at the server from partially-shared GAN models trained locally at client users, in which each user only shares its discriminator with others.
The proposed PS-FedGAN significantly reduces the communication network overhead of model sharing and provides
better data privacy during communication rounds. Furthermore, it bridges the gap between utility and privacy.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we aim to develop a novel GAN-based FL framework for a global/common task in a distributed learning setup. For convenience, we will use image classification as an illustrative example henceforth.
Consider a reliable central server with limited access to client training data to achieve a desirable accuracy on the global task. Here, we assume non-IID data distributions and vulnerable communication channels among users, which are common in
practical applications. For example, in smart healthcare,
one learning task could be to train neural networks for the detection of a specific disease.
One clinic may have a unique set of brain images from patients whereas other
neighboring hospitals may also have access to several types of similar diseases with a plethora of examples. A global model
based on all distributed data
to detect these diseases could benefit all hospitals and provide better service for patients.
In such a collaborative system, local data
privacy is a critical concern. Also,
adding noises to the dataset
to hide sensitive information may
lead to unwanted information distortion and/or artifacts.
In this work, we address the problem of how to preserve
local privacy while preserving the original data statistics.</p>

In alignment with other GAN-related FL works, we assume a
system with a centralized server in the cloud
and multiple distributed clients/users in
communication with the server. Each client has access to enough resources to train a local GAN model. Note that, although we apply conditional GANs (cGAN)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mirza and Osindero (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> to alleviate the need for label detection via pseudo-labeling,

The bottleneck faced by any attacker against our model lies in
the hidden generator model that is prone to information
leakage. Therefore, the process of reconstructing synthetic data helps preserve privacy in terms of the initial weights and network architecture, as further elaborated in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Theoretical Results ‣ PS-FedGAN: An Efficient Federated Learning Framework Based on Partially Shared Generative Adversarial Networks For Data Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Predicting the exact architecture has become challenging owing to advancements in deep learning techniques.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For an attacker to obtain information, it is crucial to eavesdrop from the very beginning and ensure they do not miss any round of communication. Such requirements prove difficult for potential privacy attackers.
Additionally, the attacker must acquire knowledge of the initial weights of the generator, to be discussed in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Theoretical Results ‣ PS-FedGAN: An Efficient Federated Learning Framework Based on Partially Shared Generative Adversarial Networks For Data Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. However, in practice, it is typically challenging, and often impossible, for an attacker to accurately estimate the generator’s structure due to various practical constraints such as power, latency, and hardware
capabilities. The complexity and variability of generator architectures play a significant role in preserving privacy. The diverse range of architectures available for generators, coupled with their complexity, makes it highly challenging for an attacker to accurately infer the precise model structure. This inherent difficulty further enhances the preservation of privacy in the system. By utilizing complex and variable generator architectures, PS-FedGAN adds an additional layer of protection against potential privacy breaches.</p>

the FG. More specially, we see a significant improvement in PS-FedGAN in Split-1 for the CIFAR10 dataset.
Compared with full-GAN (FG) sharing, our partially-shared GAN
achieves similar performance but at significantly reduced communication cost and privacy loss as further shown in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.3 Evaluation of communication Cost ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ PS-FedGAN: An Efficient Federated Learning Framework Based on Partially Shared Generative Adversarial Networks For Data Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
Note that in the above test, the SDA-FL method requires an infinite privacy budget to achieve the desired utility. This indicates that SDA-FL faces significant challenges in balancing privacy and utility.
Additionally, it is worth mentioning that other alternatives provide more real data for the classifier from Split-1 to Split-3, whereas in our proposed method, we maintain a constant amount of real data on the server (1%). Similar results can be seen for Split-3 in the Appendix.</p>

Note that in this scenario, user-1 has 2 classes, user-2 has 3 classes, and user-3 has 5 classes. These results suggest that an attacker must obtain very accurate information on architecture and initial model weights to achieve higher
and nontrivial inference accuracy. Since such requirements
are improbable and impractical, our results
establish the robustness of our proposed method against classification attacks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Reconstruction Quality and Similarity</span> As presented in the paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dangwal et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite>, reconstruction quality and similarity can be used as a measure of privacy leakage. For this, we consider 2 metrics, i.e., SSIM and NMSE, in Setup-1. Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Privacy Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ PS-FedGAN: An Efficient Federated Learning Framework Based on Partially Shared Generative Adversarial Networks For Data Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> compares the corresponding generations of the attacker and the cloud based on the similarity between each generated image. From Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Privacy Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ PS-FedGAN: An Efficient Federated Learning Framework Based on Partially Shared Generative Adversarial Networks For Data Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we can see that the NMSE values achieved by the attackers are high while SSIM (maximum 1) is very low. These results indicate that the attacker-generated images cannot capture the true data distribution. We shall further show in Appendix that, if the attacker deviates from the actual generator weights, its convergence would be to a trivial point. As a result, no underlying user data properties are captured, as illustrated by the visual examples in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.2 Privacy Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ PS-FedGAN: An Efficient Federated Learning Framework Based on Partially Shared Generative Adversarial Networks For Data Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we develop a GAN-based FL framework PS-FedGAN, which can beneficially preserve local data privacy and reduce communication overhead in comparison with existing FL proposals. Our novel PS-FedGAN achieves
learning utility comparable to that of fully shared GAN architecture, while significantly securing data privacy and lowering the communication cost.
Empirical results further demonstrate superior results against state-of-the-art GAN-based FL frameworks. This
PS-FedGAN principle and architecture can be directly generalized
to incorporate any existing GAN.
In future work, we plan further explore the effect
of lossy networking channels and improve PS-FedGAN’s robustness against
non-ideal network links.
Another promising extension of this work is to explore the model and data heterogeneity presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Vahidian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>

simple and efficient method for privacy-protected distributed learning. In classic FL, local data collections are often non-IID, unbalanced, and widely distributed, typically with limited communication bandwidth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan et al. [<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite>. To reduce communication overhead and maintain privacy, a Federated Average (FedAvg) algorithm is proposed. FedAvg aggregates gradient updates from different users by combining several local updates in a single round of communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Konečný et al.

How to effectively handle non-IID data distributions among different users remains an open FL question. First, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. [<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>]</cite> is proposed
as a generalized FedAvg for heterogeneous networks.
SCAFFOLD is another extension of FedAvg that incorporates predictive variance reduction techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Karimireddy et al. [<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Luo et al. [<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a classifier calibration with virtual representation,
leveraging a Gaussian Mixer Model to sample virtual features. As an alternative solution, the authors of  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Yoshida et al. [<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>]</cite> proposed raw data sharing in a cooperative learning mechanism. In  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. [<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed
the use of some initial training data e.g., 5%, to handle non-IID data with traditional FL algorithms.
Some other classic methods for non-IID data include GAN sharing  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al.

<p id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Training GANs locally before sharing trained models with a centralized server is a
popular approach for handling both IID and non-IID data distributions.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang et al. [<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite>, the authors applied a conditional GAN (cGAN) and shared
local classifier and generator with the central server which trains a global classifier and a generator to guide
local users. Applying similar concept, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wu et al. [<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>]</cite> proposed to incorporate model splitting to keep part of the cGAN (discriminator) and part of the hidden classifier by sharing the generator and a global classifier. In addition, as introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. [<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>], Cao et al. [<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>]</cite>, one can share the entire local GAN with the server and create a synthetic dataset to train a global GAN. Similarly, full GAN sharing has been discussed in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. [<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>]</cite>. Only shared generators with the maximum mean discrepancy are aggregated. To address privacy concerns, DP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dwork [<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>]</cite> has been applied in GAN-based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xu et al.

For the dataset MNIST, FMNIST, and SVHN, we keep the 1% original data available on the server. For the CIFAR10, we consider 10 % of the original data at the cloud server. Considering that other evaluated methods may have more original data to train the classifier, this ratio is reasonable in Split-3.
Shown as the results, our the proposed methods show superior and competitive performance compared to most of the SOTA methods which match the previous conclusions in Split-1/2.</p>
