<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The decentralized Federated Learning (FL) paradigm built upon blockchain architectures leverages distributed node clusters to replace the single server for executing FL model aggregation. This paradigm tackles the vulnerability of the centralized malicious server in vanilla FL and inherits the trustfulness and robustness offered by blockchain. However, existing blockchain-enabled schemes face challenges related to inadequate confidentiality on models and limited computational resources of blockchains to perform large-scale FL computations. In this paper, we present Voltran, an innovative hybrid platform designed to achieve trust, confidentiality, and robustness for FL based on the combination of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and blockchain technology. We offload the FL aggregation computation into TEE to provide an isolated, trusted and customizable off-chain execution, and then guarantee the authenticity and verifiability of aggregation results on the blockchain. Moreover, we provide strong scalability on multiple FL scenarios by introducing a multi-SGX parallel execution strategy to amortize the large-scale FL workload. We implement a prototype of Voltran and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Voltran incurs minimal additional overhead while guaranteeing trust, confidentiality, and authenticity, and it significantly brings a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art ciphertext aggregation schemes.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning methodology that involves training deep neural networks on individual devices to produce local models, which are then aggregated to construct a global model on a central server. Its ability to keep clients’ individual data locally has garnered significant attention and is extensively utilized in multiple data-sensitive domains, such as Google Keyboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, e-healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and economic applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, current FL paradigms rely on a centralized server to execute model aggregation. This paradigm renders them vulnerable to malfunction or active attacks that may incur interruption or termination of tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Moreover, a centralized server has complete dominance over the aggregation process, thus potentially being able to tamper with data or bias model training results maliciously. To mitigate these issues brought by the centralized server, the utilization of blockchain technology helps establish a decentralized framework for FL by its inherent distributed architecture. Specifically, smart contracts supported by the blockchain can be leveraged to implement secure aggregation algorithms to prevent malicious FL attacks such as poisoning. Moreover, the financial attribute of blockchains can handle the lack of incentives for the FL clients for a fair billing marketplace.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the considerable alignment between blockchain and FL, there are two main deficiencies needed to be addressed: a). <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">confidentiality</span>, adversaries can retrieve sensitive information from the model parameters (e.g., gradient information can be used to infer the private clients’ training data). Existing blockchain-enabled schemes do not perform well in maintaining confidentiality due to the publicly visible nature of blockchain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. These solutions either directly carry out plaintext model transmission or use differential privacy (DP) to inject noise into models, which leads to a dilemma between accuracy and privacy; b). <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">practicality</span>, the blockchain takes the form of full-repetitive computations on all nodes to ensure reliability, which causes little computational power and storage capacity to handle large-scale computing tasks. FL aggregation is a computation-intensive task with large-scale data, intricate calculations, and high-efficiency requirements. Low aggregation efficiency will affect model convergence, thereby impacting the real-time demand and accuracy of models. Therefore, it is impractical for FL to perform direct on-chain computations due to its high computational costs and low throughput. Overall, it is necessary to design a solution that can solve these two problems for blockchain-based FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), such as Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX), can be applied to complement blockchain-based FL systems. It provides an isolated region to guarantee confidentiality and integrity of codes and data running in it. Hence, blockchain nodes can execute the FL aggregation process within TEEs to address confidentiality and trustfulness concerns. Local models are securely transmitted into TEE based on cryptographic primitives for off-chain aggregation execution, and then results are uploaded on the blockchain after verification for storage. Meanwhile, by offloading aggregation computation into TEE, computational workloads for blockchain nodes are greatly decreased, thus addressing the issue of practicality by low computational power.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Challenges.</span> Building such a hybrid system is not straightforward and requires addressing several challenges: a). <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">securely hybridization</span>, which means that it needs to design a comprehensive protocol to ensure the system achieves data confidentiality and computation result correctness and authenticity in FL aggregation computation while maintaining the privacy-protection of clients’ raw data in vanilla FL; b). <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">throughput</span>, which means that inefficient blockchains may become a performance bottleneck, requiring a shift in the existing blockchain computing paradigm to enhance its throughput to meet FL performance requirements; c). <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">capacity</span>, which means large-scale FL models may exceed the capacity of both blockchain and TEE (e.g., Intel SGX 1 is limited to 128 MB), necessitating considerations on how to make the system capable of handling such large volumes of data. We will further elaborate on the specific challenges and countermeasures in Section IV. Furthermore, focusing on FL scenarios, the system needs to be general to adapt to various FL aggregation algorithms. All the considerations above motivate us to propose a high-level blockchain-TEE hybridized system for FL aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose Voltran, a trusted, decentralized and privacy-preserving FL aggregation platform that enables high integratability on secure aggregation strategies. The core of our idea is a secure and well-structured integration of blockchain and TEE technology with FL’s real-world scenarios. This is not trivial work because combining these three parties requires solving complex hybrid processes and technical challenges. Voltran uses blockchain as the underlying architecture that abolishes the vanilla FL paradigm of a single server. Instead, we conduct the aggregation computation on the distributed blockchain nodes by perform smart contracts. Different from the traditional on-chain smart contract execution form, Voltran extends a new form of smart contracts with Intel SGX by offloading the contract execution off chain in TEEs and performing on-chain verification of the correct execution. Based on this paradigm, Voltran can support large-scale computation-intense task such as FL aggregation by implementing aggregation algorithms into our <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">new-style</span> contracts (i.e., into TEEs). Furthermore, we consider the limited size of TEE memory and design a multi-SGX parallel execution strategy, placing models from different clients into multiple SGXs for sub-aggregation based on their different weights, to amortize the computation and communication overhead. To our knowledge, we are the first FL aggregation scheme while considering these specific challenges and providing solutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Another consequent advantage brought from our combination is that Voltran implements computations directly in plaintext with confidentiality by performing aggregation in TEE, resulting in minimal performance overhead and high scalability. It brings immediate convenience and realizability to defend against aggregation attacks. Previous security aggregation algorithms using cryptographic primitives, such as homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and secure multi-party computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, perform aggregation on encrypted data. These schemes bring massive computation and communication overhead, which makes them challenging to implement in real-world applications. In contrast, Voltran can support plaintext aggregation that achieves multiple customized efficient and secure aggregation schemes based on plaintext <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Developing applications that emphasize data confidentiality poses numerous challenges. The inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information can occur even with a minor vulnerability in privileged code running on the platform. To address this, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> provides a secure area within the central processor, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the code and data loaded into it. GlobalPlatform <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> gives a definition of TEE: the TEE is an execution environment that runs alongside but is isolated from the device’s main operating system. It protects its assets against general software attacks. It can be implemented using multiple technologies, and its level of security varies accordingly.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Intel’s SGX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> introduce a set of unique instructions that offer hardware-level protections for user-level codes. This empowers software developers with the ability to exert control over the security of sensitive code and data. SGX enables the execution of processes within a protected address space called “enclave”. Enclaves safeguard confidentiality and integrity by protecting it from specific forms of hardware attacks as well as other software on the same host, including the operating system. The protected memory region is called the Processor Reserved Memory range (PRM). Enclave Page Cache (EPC) paging enables the mapping of trusted pages in PRM to the untrusted memory when memory usage exceeds its limitations. It serves to enhance overall system performance. EPC paging takes more time than common paging because it takes cryptographic operations to protect trusted pages. Most versions of SGXs have 128 MB or 256 MB of PRM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although data is effectively protected within the isolated space created by SGX, it may still be vulnerable during transmission. The encryption of communication channels can provide data protection, but it cannot guarantee the authenticity of communication parties. Intel provides an advanced capability known as Remote Attestation (RA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, which is designed to offer enhanced assurance in the integrity and authenticity of an entity to a remote service provider. RA verifies three items: the application’s identity, its integrity (that it has not been tampered with), and whether it is running safely within an enclave on an Intel SGX-enabled platform. It also shares the session key between the two parties, thus encrypting the transmitted data to ensure confidentiality and significantly improve trust.</p>

The ledger takes the form of a chain data structure consisting of chronologically ordered blocks containing transactions sent by users and other information that guarantees security. Due to its distributed consensus and cryptography-based data structures, such as Merkle Tree of Bitcoin <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, data stored on the blockchain can be trusted and tamper-proof. Smart contracts are a secure and decentralized computing paradigm provided by the blockchain. It is a program executed by a network of participators who agree on the states of the program. The contract developer defines the code logic of the contract, and the contract user invokes the different interfaces provided by the contract through the specified input to obtain the output of the contract execution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing smart contract-enabled blockchain systems take the form of replicating data and computation across all nodes in the system so that a single node can verify the correct execution of the contract. Full replicated execution on all nodes provides high robustness and availability. However, double counting on all blockchain nodes leads to a severe waste of computational power. To prop up computational power consumption, the inherent blockchain design renders users to pay for this overhead, which brings a huge economic burden for users. Therefore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed solutions that integrate TEE into blockchains to enable confidentiality and improve computational power. Inspired by them, we propose a TEE-enabled blockchain framework oriented for FL scenarios. The blockchain can be leveraged to record and synchronize TEE’s results to maintain integrity and consistency.</p>

In a vanilla FL framework, the centralized server has access to the model data passed by all clients, which enables inference attacks. In Voltran, we replace the centralized server mode with a distributed cluster of SGX nodes to perform aggregation tasks. This design allows the clients to send their local models to the execution nodes, which load models into SGX enclaves.

Voltran must ensure that the confidentiality of client-supplied models participating in the aggregation process is protected. In the absence of TEE violations, Voltran guarantees that FL inputs and outputs are kept secret from all parties except the clients themselves.

The security of the committee system is analogous to the security of the blockchain system, which depends on the number of selected nodes and the security of the consensus algorithm. To simplify Voltran’s security considerations, we assume that the committee is secure and that the decisions and data it produces are trusted.

They can create and cancel processes at will, delay or reject incoming messages, and try to forge the outgoing messages from SGX.

However, differences in individual configurations, network environments and local data volumes can lead to different uploading speeds and even timeouts for clients.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Maintaining a multi-entity framework like Voltran requires considering the stability of each end-to-end connection. To ensure the smooth execution of tasks, several issues need to be considered: a). the network conditions of clients, as clients with limited bandwidth for model uploading can slow down the aggregation progress; b). the size of the trusted area that SGX can create is limited, and larger aggregation tasks cannot be performed in a single SGX; c). the capacity of transactions allowed by the blockchain is limited, and the aggregated results cannot be uploaded in a single transaction. Therefore, in Voltran, we propose a new execution strategy that splits the computation task into several subtasks and puts them into multiple SGXs to execute an efficient and well-organized schedule for resource-intensive tasks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Let us take a holistic view of the data that requires SGX computation. It is the machine learning model sent by multiple clients. The models of different clients have the same network structure but different weights. All the data can be seen as a matrix, with each layer as a row and each client as a column. There are two priority strategies for splitting this data: <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ClientMax</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">LayerMax</span>.

The advantage of this partition is that it adheres to the general aggregation logic where weights of the same layer should be placed in the same SGX as much as possible. This allows for quick aggregation of layer weights with multiple SGXs. Each SGX is responsible for aggregation on weights of one layer and sends results onto <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif">Con<math id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{}_{\textnormal{stor}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1a" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"></mi><mtext id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.1a.cmml">stor</mtext></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.1a.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.1"><mtext mathsize="70%" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1.1.1">stor</mtext></ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1.m1.1c">{}_{\textnormal{stor}}</annotation></semantics></math></span> respectively. It takes the pressure off the bandwidth but brings more communication. The second strategy conforms to the client’s common upload logic. In this mode, all the clients send all the parameters of their local model to one single SGX. Data are stored in the virtual memory outside the SGX and wait for the <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ecall</span> instruction. It needs to perform EPC paging and change the data accessing context. Aggregation results are cumulated and form the global model. This mode needs less SGX but requires serial execution. Both strategies have to consider the transaction capacity limitation and may need to divide the outputs into several pieces to be sent on the blockchain when the model size is large. In summary, these two data-splitting strategies are generic for computations on FL. Choosing a suitable splitting scheme and the right scheduling strategy can help significantly improve efficiency.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Our framework is a hybrid system of blockchain and TEE. The main effect of blockchain is reflected in the decentralized verification of TEE calculation results. Although SGX provides RA services to verify the authenticity of its identity, once an unexpected error occurs, non-blockchain architecture cannot automatically verdict the correctness so as to solve the dispute. Hence, it has to bring in a trusted third party for arbitration. We believe that blockchain with smart contracts provides a perfect arbitration platform. The contract can automatically review and verify the computation results by executing the pre-written verification code, thus avoiding disputes. Moreover, blockchain is also a secure and trusted distributed database. Storing data on the blockchain achieves traceability and immutability. In addition, the incentive mechanism carried by the blockchain can provide rewards to clients and execution nodes, which motivate <math id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{{\color[rgb]{0.4375,0.1484375,0.00390625}C}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" mathcolor="#702601" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒞</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝒞</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{{\color[rgb]{0.4375,0.1484375,0.00390625}C}}</annotation></semantics></math> to contribute their data to participate in training and motivate <math id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{{\color[rgb]{0.4375,0.1484375,0.00390625}N}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" mathcolor="#702601" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝒩</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝒩</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">\mathcal{{\color[rgb]{0.4375,0.1484375,0.00390625}N}}</annotation></semantics></math> to contribute SGXs to help computation respectively.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Other than current blockchain-only systems, Voltran is not limited to a specified form of contract implementation. We define all the programs executed in our system as smart contracts. Hence, both the enclave executable files in SGXs and the traditional contract deployed on the blockchain are seen as smart contracts.

Users need to provide the following specific functions according to the logic specified by the wrapper to meet the running requirements of Voltran: 1. Encryption and decryption; 2. Attack detection/scoring (optional); 3. Aggregation; 4. Digital signature. In essence, Voltran does not provide a service of secure aggregation but an environment capable of performing secure, trusted and privacy-preserving computations. Our framework does not restrict any data, model or algorithm. Users can arbitrarily choose any secure aggregation algorithm to design their contracts according to their personalized demands.</p>

Scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> utilize differential privacy to achieve confidentiality, which may lead to the trade-off between privacy and model performance. Also, they put the aggregation computation on the chain directly, which may be an impractical design because the blockchain makes it hard to process large-scale computation. Scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> does not consider the confidentiality of model updates. Scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> also leverages the blockchain and TEE to realize DFL. However, their design leads to data leakage on the blockchain nodes, and they do not separate TEE and the blockchain, which means each blockchain node has to be equipped with a TEE, making their work impractical. Furthermore, their TEE result verification mechanism is based on the IAS, which needs a node to access the off-chain environment. This operation requires the node’s own subjective judgment of correctness rather than automatic execution by smart contracts, which makes this design not feasible from a practical point of view. Scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> proposes a TEE-based secure aggregation scheme. Unlike us, they perform aggregation based on a single TEE node, resulting in a single point of failure problem. Scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> presents a privacy-preserving FL scheme based on differential privacy, which has the same problem with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Also, they do not mention the decentralization. Scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposes a homomorphic encryption-based FL scheme. Their confidentiality relies on the strong trust assumptions of the Verifier and Solver in their design. Also, they leverage the blockchain only to store procedure values, which does not improve their reliability. Scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> applies the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier algorithm for DFL without introducing extra components. Similar to differential privacy, their privacy-preserving strength also involves a trade-off with a “gap”, meaning that the greater the privacy protection strength, the larger the communication overhead required. In addition, Voltran presents a multi-SGX parallel execution mode, which is unique from other schemes. However, our scheme is based on hardware support due to the usage of TEE.</p>

Due to cryptographic operations and additional time overhead brought by SGX, Voltran’s aggregation time is longer than vanilla FL. Deeply, the gap becomes larger when the model size gets larger. This is because the larger data amount brings more cryptographic operations. Meanwhile, if the data amount exceeds the maximum enclave capacity, it needs EPC paging, which takes more time. However, we claim our platform meets the feasibility criteria because Voltran achieves confidentiality-preserving aggregation, and compared to other state-of-the-art privacy-preserving aggregation schemes, Voltran presents higher efficiency. We display the experimental results and analysis in the following question D.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Voltran provides 1 to <span id="S7.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">n</span> execution nodes with SGX to provide secure computation service for FL aggregation, which brings two execution modes: parallel processing of multiple SGXs and sequential execution of one single SGX. The mode choice depends on the task’s size and the node’s liveness. One-SGX execution can undertake tasks based on models with fewer parameters because network bandwidth and SGX EPC paging bring little influence to efficiency. When large models with more layers and computational costs are encountered, the multi-SGX parallel strategy will take effect. We test the performance of the two scheduling strategies for different numbers of clients under ResNet18. Fig. <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ VII-C How do two scheduling modes affect the FL performance? ‣ VII Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Voltran: Unlocking Trust and Confidentiality in Decentralized Federated Learning Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> shows the experimental results. The parallel strategy becomes more and more advantageous than individual execution as the client number gets larger. The reason is that parallel execution reduces the bandwidth limitation and the number of times SGX performs EPC paging, significantly improving execution efficiency.</p>

It can be seen that Voltran takes an obvious advantage over <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> because the noise added to the data affects the performance of the aggregated model.

As the aggregation proceeds, the loss function value decreases. Furthermore, As <math id="S7.SS4.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS4.p3.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S7.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S7.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS4.p3.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S7.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS4.p3.2.m2.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS4.p3.2.m2.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math> increases (indicating lower privacy protection), the loss function value decreases. This is because a higher privacy protection level of DP increases the standard deviation of additive noise terms and decreases the model quality. Overall, although DP may have good efficiency, the inevitable trade-off between its privacy level and accuracy degrades the model performance, while Voltran still maintains the same model performance as non-privacy protection models due to its support for plaintext aggregation.</p>

When data needs to be used and analyzed, it has to be decrypted into plaintext, thus leading to privacy leakage. Therefore, trivial encryption schemes generally cannot provide privacy protection on data usage. Differential privacy (DP) can ensure data privacy protection for transmission and usage, but the noise added to the data can lead to distortion. Our design brings a higher level of privacy protection brought by end-to-end encryption and TEE. We guarantee data privacy throughout the entire process of data transmission and usage while providing higher security.</p>

Similar to SEAR, we also evaluate the three situations in which there are no Byzantine adversaries; the Byzantine adversaries do not collude, and they collude.

<div id="S7.SS7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We attempt to minimize the negative impact of the blockchain. We count the end-to-end latency of different blockchains to measure their impact on FL performance, including Ethereum, Fabric and Tendermint. For Ethereum, we create an Ethereum private chain without any modifications to the official main chain. Our prototype Voltran-Fabric is used to measure latency by Fabric. Furthermore, to show the high scalability of Voltran, we provide another Fabric instantiation by decreasing the block interval from the default value of 2 seconds to 1 seconds and expand the block size up to 60 MB to support more extensive model storage. In Tendermint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, the block size is not fixed and can be dynamically adjusted as needed. Therefore, it can handle larger blocks and effectively process a significant amount of transaction data. We run FL tasks 1-4 in Table I on each blockchain setting. We plot a bar chart to display the distinction of end-to-end latency of FL tasks on different blockchain settings. Results are shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F15" title="Figure 15 ‣ VII-G How do blockchain settings affect the FL performance? ‣ VII Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Voltran: Unlocking Trust and Confidentiality in Decentralized Federated Learning Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>. Because of Ethereum’s slow block generation speed and small data capacity, when faced with ResNet models over 40 MB, it takes THOUSANDS of blocks to contain. Thus, we consider the native Ethereum setting unsuitable for large models. Fabric and Fabric-mod are able to take on this amount of model data with a low time overhead. In addition, Tendermint shows better performance by controlling the blockchain’s overhead below one second per round. These results demonstrate the excellent scalability of our framework to dynamically adapt the configuration to different tasks for better and more efficient completion.</p>

<div id="S7.SS8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the performance of Voltran when the number of nodes increases, or the FL network expands to highlight the scalability of our system by concluding the experimental results above. We will discuss the following three dimensions: the number of clients, model size, and execution nodes. First, we consider the increase in the number of FL client nodes. In our experiments, we set the maximum client number as 500. At this size, we first compare Voltran with vanilla FL, as shown in Table III, and find that in terms of aggregation time and accuracy, the performance does not experience an additional decrease due to an increase in the number of clients. We also make comparisons with other privacy-preserving schemes, as shown in Table IV, and outperform the performance of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Second, we consider the larger model size. In Table I, we conduct experiments on ResNet18 (42.64MB), ResNet50 (81.20MB) and Bert (390.16MB), which can be as large models. Experimental results are shown in Table III, indicating that these large models can perform well within Voltran. Third, we consider the increase of execution nodes in our system. Due to our support of multi-SGX parallel execution, increasing execution nodes can provide more efficient computation. We present the significant performance improvement of multi-SGX execution compared to single-SGX execution in Fig. <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ VII-C How do two scheduling modes affect the FL performance? ‣ VII Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Voltran: Unlocking Trust and Confidentiality in Decentralized Federated Learning Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose Voltran, a novel platform specifically designed to enable confidentiality-preserving and trustful FL aggregation based on a hybrid architecture combined with Intel SGX and the blockchain. Benefiting from our secure data transmission protocol, Voltran can guarantee the correctness, authenticity and confidentiality of the clients’ local model data. Further, we consider several challenges when implementing Voltran, including the deficiency of the throughput and capacity, and propose a multi-SGX parallel mechanism to address them. A prototype of Voltran is implemented and six diverse tasks are extensively evaluated on it. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of Voltran.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we plan to consider the applicability of Voltran on larger-scale tasks, such as GPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>. Also, we plan to exploring more efficient model compression techniques such as Knowledge Distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> to further optimize computational costs and keep communication overhead low. Furthermore, in read-world applications, TEE can take on more forms. We will consider the potential threats on TEE and integrating more types of TEE into Voltran. We also consider further optimization of resource scheduling for multiple SGX in our future work, with potential optimization solutions including Ring Allreduce <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="A2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The current FL paradigm is mostly based on the assumption that a single centralized server is trustworthy and will perform fair and correct aggregation computations. However, this assumption is not always appropriate. In real-world scenarios, the central server often exhibits dishonest behavior, showing bias towards selected clients, thus affecting the actual aggregation results. Additionally, the stability of the aggregation process depends on the central server orchestrating the application of the centralized aggregator. Therefore, a single point of failure can lead to the collapse of the entire task. Hence, there is a strong motivation to develop a decentralized FL framework. Moreover, although FL is designed to protect clients’ local data, information can still be inferred by analyzing the shared gradients. Therefore, existing studies focus on the privacy-preserving FL solutions.</p>

They evaluated their performance and gave the optimal block generation rate. Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> focused on the industrial Internet of Things paradigm and designed a blockchain-enabled secure FL architecture to utilize the training process as the computation workload of the blockchain consensus. Bao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> considered the incentive to the trainers and introduced the FLChain to build a public auditable and incentive FL system. Wang <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> gave a blockchain-enabled solution to address the two challenges of gradient leakage and integrity attacks for FL. Ma et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> proposed a blockchain-enabled FL framework BLADE-FL to create an autonomous and self-motivated FL system for clients. In their design, there is no server, and the aggregation is fully executed by the clients themselves decentralized. They also consider the issues of privacy and lazy clients and give their countermeasures. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> introduces FedHP, an efficient decentralized federated learning method that addresses system and statistical heterogeneity in edge computing by adaptively controlling local update frequency and network topology to enhance training convergence and model accuracy. FedDual <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> is a privacy-preserving and efficient gradient aggregation algorithm for federated learning in large decentralized networks, enhancing communication efficiency and model performance through local differential privacy, pair-wise gossip communication, and a noise reduction trick based on Private Set Intersection. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> introduces the PVFL framework, which integrates technologies such as Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Hashing, Symmetric Encryption, and Digital Signatures to achieve privacy protection, data integrity verification, and efficient aggregation in federated learning for edge computing environments.</p>

Although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> utilize differential privacy to protect the model’s privacy. However, the problem of differential privacy is that the effect of privacy protection is contradictory to the accuracy of the model. More noise will sacrifice accuracy. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> presents the solution to eliminate the noise, but they do not consider the centralized problem. Therefore, in our scenario, we use TEE to isolate the aggregation process into a closed space and encrypt the input and output, thus protecting privacy without sacrificing accuracy. We combined TEE with blockchain to provide stronger integrity, robustness and availability guarantees.</p>

<p id="A2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Secure aggregation is a computation paradigm in FL that enables a number of clients to send their local values (usually trained models) to a server and generate an aggregated result <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Trusted hardware, particularly Intel SGX, has seen a wide spectrum of applications in FL to achieve secure aggregation and parameter preserving. However, due to the upper limitation of TEE memory size, previous studies run only part of the model (e.g., sensitive layers) inside the TEE, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>. PPFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> deployed TrustZone on clients for local training and SGX on the server for aggregation, respectively. With regard to memory size, they took greedy layer-wise training to get around it. SEAR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> utilized Intel SGX to execute secure and Byzantine-robust aggregation and protect clients’ private models. Moreover, they considered the limitation of trusted memory size and provided data storage modes to enhance efficiency. PPFL do not consider Byzantine resilience and poisoning attacks; these two schemes ignore the single point of failure on the SGX server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>.</p>

Malicious execution nodes or clients may intentionally delay the execution or even break down at any operation step. In Voltran, there are two execution modes for aggregation: a single SGX or multiple ones. In either case, a single point of failure of one SGX will crash the entire task. Voltran should be able to handle both sides of the fault separately to ensure the execution of the task. In Section III-E, we describe how we achieve high robustness.</p>

To overcome this threat, our system provides two mitigation measures. Due to our FL-oriented system, the first is to integrate secure aggregation algorithms into TEEs against side channel attacks such as [26]. The second is our secret key mechanism. Due to our committee, each time a new task starts, the keys are updated, thus avoiding the compromise of previous data confidentiality.

TEE lacks the ability to distinguish the correct current state for recovery. In our FL aggregation scenarios, each aggregation computation performed by TEE is independent and does not depend on the previous TEE state. Therefore, we do not need to consider the issues of TEE state failure and atomic delivery proposed by [24]. Even if a failure occurs in a TEE during the aggregation process, the committee will promptly detect the anomaly due to the heartbeat mechanism and re-schedule to ensure the continued execution of tasks, without the need to restore TEE state. Furthermore, to guarantee the consistency and persistency of TEE-based execution, we upload each aggregation results binding with the current task and round number as the state and guide the control of the TEE’s execution, rather than relying on time. Once chaos occurs, errors can be clearly identified through this state.</p>

<p id="A4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given that clients exclusively serve as users of our framework by providing data, we intentionally exclude considerations pertaining to the specifics of their local training processes and potential variations in training speeds due to individual disparities. As we preserve the original computational procedure for training and aggregation, we anticipate that the accuracy and convergence speed of FL models will remain unaffected by Voltran. Our focus lies solely on assessing the performance implications introduced by Voltran on FL. The impact brought by Voltran stems from the distributed aggregation paradigm, which leads to an increase in the number of communications and encryption/decryption operations. These overheads are present in every phase of Voltran execution. The specific numbers of these metrics are subject to variability and are contingent upon the particular FL tasks at hand. In addition, Voltran incorporates more security features. Secure aggregation algorithms can be implemented in SGX to fortify against potential attacks. Compared to prevalent ciphertext aggregation algorithms such as homomorphic encryption, Voltran’s utilization of plaintext aggregation may significantly alleviate time costs. Therefore, we characterize the performance of the framework by measuring the following metrics:</p>

<p id="A4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate our practicality, we compare Voltran with two current state-of-the-art FL frameworks MNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>, an efficient and lightweight machine learning framework optimized for mobile devices, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, a pratical secure aggregation framework based on secret sharing proposed by Google.

</div>
<div id="A4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, since MNN is a framework for clients, we compare Voltran with it to evaluate the performance of our client side. Because MNN is a tensor compute engine along with the data processing and model execution libraries, we make our client side follow this framework with additional operations for security. We perform a recommendation task on the model of Linear Regression with the dataset Avazu and a natural language processing (NLP) task on the model of Stack LSTM with the dataset Sent140. Experimental results are shown in Table <a href="#A4.T8" title="TABLE VIII ‣ D-B Comparisons with state-of-the-art FL frameworks ‣ Appendix D Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Voltran: Unlocking Trust and Confidentiality in Decentralized Federated Learning Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a>. It can be seen that our framework introduces almost no additional overhead on the client side in terms of runtime, communication volume, and energy consumption. The slight additional gap arises from the encryption and decryption operations brought by our approach to safeguard the privacy of the models.</p>

<p id="A4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present the specific overhead of additional operations by multi-SGX. We showcase the cost of each operation individually in Fig. <a href="#A4.F18" title="Figure 18 ‣ D-A Evaluation Metrics ‣ Appendix D Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Voltran: Unlocking Trust and Confidentiality in Decentralized Federated Learning Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>. Results on three operations indicate the multi-SGX mode requires more additional overhead than the single-SGX mode, especially the Remote Attestation operation. This is because multi-SGX mode asks each client to send its model to multiple SGXs, thus requiring more times of Remote Attestation. However, since these preparations only need to be executed once, subsequent multi-round large-scale FL training takes more time (because only large-scale tasks need multi-SGX mode to enhance efficiency), whereas pre-processing time can be seen less significant in comparison. We take the ResNet18 task as an instance in Fig. <a href="#A4.F18" title="Figure 18 ‣ D-A Evaluation Metrics ‣ Appendix D Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Voltran: Unlocking Trust and Confidentiality in Decentralized Federated Learning Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>. We take 4 SGX units to perform the task. The total FL training time for the client number of 10, 50, 100, 500 during 50 rounds is 1622.49, 2763.02, 3495.84 and 13254.78 seconds, which are all significantly greater than their respective pre-processing times.</p>

<p id="A4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the need to schedule FL tasks and allocate them to SGX nodes, our approach considers introducing a committee mechanism to achieve this purpose. However, the implementation and optimization of the committee mechanism are not the main contribution of our work. The specific implementation of the committee can be referred to schemes [1] or [2]. We provide simulated experiments for SGX node recovery referring to the committee implemented referred to [1]. Specifically, we measure the total recovery time of our mechanism against SGX node dropout in different network sizes with various dropout situations. We take the ResNet18 and ResNet50 tasks and set the number of clients as 100. We set the total number of SGX nodes in the system as 10, 20, 40, 80 and vary the random node dropout ratio from 10% to 30% to measure the mechanism execution time overhead in Table <a href="#A4.T10" title="TABLE X ‣ D-D Node Dropout Recovery ‣ Appendix D Evaluation and Discussion ‣ Voltran: Unlocking Trust and Confidentiality in Decentralized Federated Learning Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">X</span></a>.
