<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">The classification performance of the random vector functional link (RVFL), a randomized neural network, has been widely acknowledged. However, due to its shallow learning nature, RVFL often fails to consider all the relevant information available in a dataset. Additionally, it overlooks the geometrical properties of the dataset. To address these limitations, a novel graph random vector functional link based on two-view learning (GRVFL-2V) model is proposed. The proposed model is trained on multiple views, incorporating the concept of multiview learning (MVL), and it also incorporates the geometrical properties of all the views using the graph embedding (GE) framework. The fusion of RVFL networks, MVL, and GE framework enables our proposed model to achieve the following: i) <span id="id1.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">efficient learning</span>: by leveraging the topology of RVFL, our proposed model can efficiently capture nonlinear relationships within the multi-view data, facilitating efficient and accurate predictions; ii) <span id="id1.id1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">comprehensive representation</span>: fusing information from diverse perspectives enhance the proposed model’s ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data, thereby improving the model’s overall generalization performance; and iii) <span id="id1.id1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">structural awareness</span>: by employing the GE framework, our proposed model leverages the original data distribution of the dataset by naturally exploiting both intrinsic and penalty subspace learning criteria. The evaluation of the proposed GRVFL-2V model on various datasets, including 27 UCI and KEEL datasets, 50 datasets from Corel5k, and 45 datasets from AwA, demonstrates its superior performance compared to baseline models. These results highlight the enhanced generalization capabilities of the proposed GRVFL-2V model across a diverse range of datasets.</span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The artificial neural networks (ANNs) belong to the class of non-parametric learning methods that are used for estimating or approximating functions that may depend on a large number of inputs and outputs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Inspired by the topology of biological neural networks, ANNs have found applications in diverse domains, such as image recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, stock price prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, brain age prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and so on. The efficacy of ANNs depends upon several factors, including the quality and quantity of data, computational resources, and the effectiveness of underlying algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The ANNs are trained by optimizing a cost function, which quantifies the disparity between model predictions and actual observations. The adjustment of the network’s weights and biases is facilitated through back-propagation, employing an iterative technique known as the gradient descent (GD) method. To enhance the agreement between predicted outcomes and actual observations, the optimization process requires fine-tuning the network’s weights and biases. Nevertheless, GD-based algorithms come with inherent limitations, including slow convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, difficulty in achieving global minima <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and heightened sensitivity to the selection of learning rate and the point of initialization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Randomized neural networks (RNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> have emerged as a unique solution to overcome the difficulties faced in training ANNs using gradient descent (GD) methods. Unlike conventional ANNs, RNNs adopt a distinct approach where the network’s weights and biases are randomly selected from a specified range and remain constant throughout the training process. The determination of output layer parameters in RNNs is achieved through a closed-form solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, as opposed to iterative-based optimization techniques commonly employed in traditional ANNs.
The prominent examples of RNNs include the random vector functional link (RVFL) network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and the extreme learning machines (ELM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. RVFL has garnered significant attention within the realm of RNNs due to its distinctive features, including direct connections between input and output layers that improve generalization performance, a straightforward architecture aligned with Occam’s Razor principle and PAC learning theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, a reduced number of parameters, and the universal approximation capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the direct connections help to regulate the randomness in RVFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, while the output parameters are computed analytically through methods like pseudo-inverse or least-square techniques.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Various enhancements have been implemented to optimize the learning capabilities of RVFL, with notable advancements such as the sparse pre-trained random vector functional link (SP-RVFL) network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and the discriminative manifold RVFL neural network (DM-RVFLNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The SP-RVFL network utilizes diverse weight initialization methods to improve the generalization performance of standard RVFL models, while the DM-RVFLNN integrates manifold learning with a soft label matrix to enhance the model’s discriminative capacity by increasing the margin between samples from different classes. In addition, techniques such as manifold learning based on an in-class similarity graph have been employed to enhance the compactness and similarity of samples within the same class. To address noise and outliers, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Cui et al. [<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed an RVFL-based approach that incorporates a novel feature selection (FS) technique, enhancing the efficiency and robustness of RVFL through the augmented Lagrangian method. Furthermore, the integration of a kernel function into RVFL has led to the development of the kernel exponentially extended RVFL network (KERVFLN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, demonstrating the adaptability and potential of RVFL in various machine learning applications. Recent advancements in RVFL theory include RVFL+, kernel RVFL+ (KRVFL+) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, incremental learning paradigm with privileged information for RVFL (IRVFL+), and improved fuzziness-based RVFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, showcasing the ongoing evolution and versatility of RVFL models in addressing diverse machine-learning challenges, including multilabel classification tasks using RNNs. Some recent advancements in RVFL theory include neuro-fuzzy RVFL for classification and regression problems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, kernel ridge regression-based randomized network for brain age classification and estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, domain-incremental learning without forgetting based on RVFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In various real-world applications, a multitude of characteristics is often observed, requiring representation through multiple feature sets. This leads to the prevalence of multiview data, where information from various measurement methods is collected to comprehensively capture the nuances of each example rather than relying solely on a single feature set. For instance, a picture can be described by color or texture features, and a person can be identified by face or fingerprints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Web pages serve as a quintessential example of multimodal data, where one feature vector encapsulates the words within the webpage text, while another feature vector captures the words present in the links pointing to the webpage from other pages. While individual views may suffice for specific learning tasks, there is potential for enhancement by fusing insights from multiple data representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Multiview learning (MVL), a well-established collection of techniques, holds significant potential as multi-modal datasets become increasingly accessible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. MVL models are often developed under the supervision of the consensus or complimentary principles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to ensure the effectiveness of an algorithm. The consensus principle aims to enhance the performance of classifiers for each view by maximizing consistency across multiple viewpoints. Conversely, the complementarity principle emphasizes the importance of providing complementary data from diverse perspectives to offer a comprehensive and accurate description of the object.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The fusion of the graph embedding (GE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> framework with the RVFL model has played a crucial role in enhancing the learning process of RVFL. By incorporating the GE framework, the RVFL model is able to capture the geometric relationships present within the dataset, which were previously overlooked <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. To incorporate the geometrical relationships within a dataset, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Malik et al. [<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> introduced the graph-embedded intuitionistic fuzzy weighted RVFL (GE-IFWRVFL) model. This model not only integrates the intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) membership scheme to handle noisy data and outliers but also preserves the geometric characteristics through the GE framework. The fusion of IF and GE with RVFL has proven to enhance the resilience and performance of the RVFL significantly. Recent advancements in RVFL have seen the utilization of GE framework in extended graph-embedded RVFL (EGERVFL) and graph-embedded intuitionistic fuzzy RVFL network for class imbalance learning (GE-IFRVFL-CIL) as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> respectively. The experimental results from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, along with studies in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, strongly support the notion that the performance of RVFL is greatly improved through the fusion of the GE framework. This emphasizes the importance of considering the geometric attributes of a dataset in the learning process to enhance the overall performance of RVFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">RVFL is categorized as a shallow learning algorithm due to its single hidden layer, which may potentially hinder its ability to fully grasp complex patterns and subtle nuances in a dataset. While RVFL may excel in specific classification tasks, its architecture could limit its capability to accurately interpret intricate patterns or extract detailed features from the dataset. The simplicity of RVFL’s architecture offers advantages in terms of computational efficiency and ease of implementation. However, when confronted with datasets containing intricate patterns or nuanced relationships among variables, more sophisticated learning frameworks are necessary to effectively capture the underlying complexities inherent in the dataset. To mitigate the limitations imposed by the subsurface learning nature of RVFL, presenting the same information from multiple perspectives can offer a solution. By training RVFL on multiple views of the data, it becomes possible to compensate for its inherent learning structure and enhance its ability to comprehend intricate patterns and subtle nuances within the dataset. Hence, leveraging the multiview learning (MVL) framework can significantly enhance the learning efficiency of RVFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Recognizing the importance of a dataset’s inherent geometrical characteristics and MVL, we propose the novel graph random vector functional link based on two-view learning (GRVFL-2V). The GRVFL-2V method incorporates the intrinsic and penalty graphical representations of multiview datasets within the GE framework, thereby capturing the geometrical properties of the multiview data. By fusing the MVL and GE framework with RVFL, the learning capabilities of RVFL are greatly enhanced, allowing it to effectively tackle classification challenges. In order to ensure simplicity and effectiveness, the proposed GRVFL-2V model incorporates two views at a time. This strategy allows for a balance between complexity and performance, as it utilizes the complementary information from these two views to enhance effectiveness while still maintaining simplicity. By leveraging information from multiple views, GRVFL-2V significantly improves the classification performance of RVFL by integrating both geometric and discriminative information from both views using intrinsic and penalty-based subspace learning criteria within the GE framework.</p>

The input and output layers are connected through the hidden layer, which acts as a bridge between them. Notably, the original features are also directly passed to the output layer because of the direct connections between the input and output layers. During the training process, the weights connecting the input and hidden layers, as well as the biases at the hidden layer, are randomly generated. Once generated, these parameters remain fixed and do not require any adjustments during the training phase. In terms of determining the output weight matrix connecting the input layer and the hidden layer to the output layer, the least squares or pseudo-inverse methods are employed, providing an analytical solution.

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Multiview learning (MVL) is an emerging area of research that holds significant promise in enhancing the generalization performance across various learning tasks. By integrating multiple feature sets, each offering unique and complementary insights, MVL has the potential to significantly improve overall model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. The abundance of diverse data types in practical applications has led to the development of MVL. In real-world scenarios, samples from different perspectives may reside in distinct spaces or exhibit vastly different distributions, often due to significant disparities between views <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. However, conventional approaches typically address such data by employing a cascade strategy, wherein multiview data is amalgamated into a single-view format through the concatenation of heterogeneous feature spaces into a homogeneous one. However, this cascading approach overlooks the distinctive statistical properties of each view and is plagued by the curse of dimensionality problems. One notable advantage of MVL is that it can enhance the performance of a standard single-view approach by leveraging manually generated multiple views.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In MVL, a distinct function is developed for each view, with the overall goal of constructing a unified function to optimize all individual functions jointly. This approach enhances the generalization performance of the framework across multiple views. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zhao et al. [<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, MVL models can be categorized into three main groups: co-training style algorithms, co-regularization style algorithms, and margin consistency style algorithms. Co-training style algorithms focus on enhancing mutual agreement among diverse views. Conversely, co-regularization style algorithms aim to minimize discrepancies during the learning process. MVL learning has been successfully implemented in various hyper-plane based classifiers, such as SVM-2K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, multiview twin support vector machine <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> (MvTSVM), deep multi-view multiclass TSVM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, MVL with robust double-sided TSVM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, etc. A notable application of MVL has been found in predicting DNA-binding protein using RVFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, MVL has demonstrated its effectiveness across various application scenarios, including enhancing image classification, annotation, and retrieval performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, predicting financial distress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, forecasting multiple stages of Alzheimer’s Disease progression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, and identifying product adoption intentions from social media data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. MVL is now widely used in many various domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> and research endeavors.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.14" class="ltx_p">In this section, we introduce a novel GRVFL-2V, which fuses the RVFL with MVL. Our proposed model is structured to leverage the strengths of RVFL while incorporating both intrinsic and penalty graphical representations of multiview data through the GE framework. To derive the network output weights, the optimization process integrates subspace learning (SL) criteria, incorporating both intrinsic and penalty-based SL methodologies within the GE framework. To preserve the geometric structure effectively, we incorporate local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> into the GE framework. Additionally, we introduce a regularization parameter for GE to enhance the learning process further. To trade off the error between multiple views, we introduce a coupling term in the primal optimization problem of the proposed model. This term minimizes the combined error from both views, resulting in an improved generalization performance for our model. The proposed optimization problem of the GRVFL-2V model is presented below:</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.9" class="ltx_p">The experiments are carried out on a PC equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6226R processor clocked at 2.90GHz and 128 GB of RAM. The system runs on Windows 11 and uses Python 3.11. The dual of the QPP in SVM2K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and MvTSVM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> is solved using the “QP solvers” function from the CVXOPT package. The dataset is randomly divided, allocating 70% of the samples for training and 30% for testing. Hyperparameters are optimized and validated using a five-fold cross-validation approach.

dataset serves as a prominent benchmark in the realms of computer vision and image processing. Comprising 5,000 images across 50 distinct categories, each category includes 100 images. This dataset is widely used for a variety of applications, including content-based image retrieval (CBIR), object recognition, and image classification. We divide the dataset into 50 binary datasets using the one-versus-rest approach. For every binary dataset, 100 photographs from the target category make up the positive class, while another 100 images are chosen at random from the other categories to make up the negative class. This approach facilitates the creation of tailored binary datasets for focused analysis and experimentation.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we presented a generic framework that fuses RVFL architecture with MVL, enhancing generalization by incorporating intrinsic and penalty graphical representations of multiview data via the GE framework, resulting in the development of the GRVFL-2V model. The proposed model aims to enhance the classification performance by fusing information from multiple views. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it is compared to various baseline models using UCI and KEEL datasets, Corel5K datasets, and AwA datasets. The experimental results reveal several key findings. Firstly, the proposed GRVFL-2V model demonstrates exceptional performance for UCI and KEEL datasets, achieving an average accuracy improvement ranging from 4% to 20% compared to the baseline models. Moreover, it also achieves the lowest rank among all the models considered. Secondly, in the case of the Corel5K dataset, our proposed GRVFL-2V model outperforms the baseline models by achieving the highest average accuracy and the lowest average rank. This indicates its superior performance in handling the Corel5K dataset. Lastly, for the AwA dataset, the proposed model exhibits outstanding performance by achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 20% compared to the baseline models. Additionally, it also attains the least average rank among all the models considered. Furthermore, a comprehensive statistical analysis is conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. The analysis includes a ranking scheme, Friedman test, Nemenyi post hoc test, and win-tie-loss test. The results of these tests unequivocally support the superiority of the proposed GRVFL-2V model over the existing baseline models.</p>

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed models have shown exceptional performance in binary classification tasks for two-view datasets. However, their effectiveness in multiclass problems has yet to be evaluated. Future research should focus on adapting these models for multiclass classification. Moreover, an essential research direction involves extending the models to accommodate datasets with more than two views while simultaneously reducing computational complexity.</p>
