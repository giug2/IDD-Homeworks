<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning that can be implemented in the IoV. However, the performance of the FL suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources to provide services for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we present a joint auction-coalition formation framework to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions to groups of IoV components. Specifically, the coalition formation game is formulated to maximize the sum of individual profits of the UAVs. The joint auction-coalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a stable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions. The auction scheme is designed to take into account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The simulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single coalition, is not always stable due to the profit-maximizing behavior of the UAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases, the UAVs prefer to support the IoV components independently and not to form any coalition.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is expected by 2023, the Internet of Things (IoT) will have a market size of $1.1 trillion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. With an increasing number of vehicles being connected to the IoT, instead of just providing information to the drivers and uploading the sensor data to the Internet, from which other users can access the data, the vehicles are connected to each other in a network such that they are able to exchange their sensor data among each other for the optimization of a well-defined utility function.
As a result, the deep integration between IoT and vehicular networks has led to the evolution of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> from the traditional Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">IoV is an open and integrated network with communication, computation, intelligence, storage and learning capabilities. Different from VANETs of which the performance is constrained by the number of vehicles connected to the networks and the mobility of the vehicles, the emphasis of the IoV network on information interaction among users, vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs) has enabled many transportation-related applications that improve the efficiency of the transportation systems, upgrade the service level of the cities and provide comfort and higher satisfaction to the drivers. The mobile crowd sensing paradigm can make use of the sensor-equipped vehicles, the RSUs as well as the mobile devices in the IoV network to produce useful traffic data that is transmitted to the cloud for analysis. The collection and the analysis of the crowd-sourced data allow us to gain meaningful insights for the provision of efficient traffic management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, route planning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> as well as to promote safe driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given the enormous amounts of dynamic data generated in the IoV network, Artificial Intelligence technologies are leveraged to build data-driven models. Specifically, many machine learning algorithms are developed to process and analyze data in order to make smart traffic predictions and provide intelligent route recommendations. To build the data-driven models, the traditional machine learning approaches require the data to be transmitted to the central data server for training. As the number of components connected to the IoV network increases, the amount of data generated in the IoV network increases exponentially. The central data server does not have sufficient storage and computing resources to store and process such massive amount of data, limiting the performance of the trained models. Besides that, the transmission of raw data over the communication channels incurs high communication cost and risks the privacy of the data as it may be eavesdropped while being transmitted.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In face of these challenges, Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> has gained great interest of the research and industrial communities. Instead of training the machine learning model at the central data server, FL allows the training of the models to take place directly on the devices by leveraging on the growing computational and storage capabilities of the IoT devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The IoV service provider runs an FL server, i.e., model owner, which employs multiple groups of parking vehicles or RSUs, i.e., workers, which collect information from their immediate surroundings. In each training iteration, the workers receive the model parameters from the model owner for model training on their respective local datasets. The updated local model parameters from all involved workers are then uploaded to the FL server which performs model aggregation. The model owner then transmits the updated model parameters to the workers for another iteration of local model training. A number of iterations is performed until a desired accuracy is achieved. Efficient data-driven models are built while preserving the privacy of the participating devices since only the model parameters, rather than the raw data, are exchanged.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, there are several challenges pertaining to FL specifically that need to be addressed for large scale implementation of efficient FL. In particular, communication inefficiency is a key bottleneck in the FL process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Since the federated network is connected to millions of devices, it is estimated that the time taken to update the local parameters over the communication channels takes longer than to compute the local parameters themselves. The data communication between the workers and the model owner may fail due to limited communication capacity and link failure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which leads to the resulting node failure and missing node information. More than 30% of node failure contributes to a significant increase of the average end-to-end delay and concurrent communication time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. This means that the number of workers participating in the model training is reduced due to communication failure, thus causing a lower accuracy of the FL model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to facilitate the network in achieving higher communication efficiency in the FL network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">The vehicles and the RSUs may not have sufficient communication bandwidth and energy capacity to transmit the local model parameters directly to the FL server which is located far away. As a result, the FL server does not receive the local model parameters from these failing nodes, which cause a degraded performance in the trained FL model. The UAVs are increasingly used as relays between the ground base terminals and the network base station <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> to improve network connectivity and extend coverage areas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Since UAVs can be quickly deployed to designated areas whenever they are needed, the UAVs are nearer to the vehicles and the RSUs. Instead of transmitting the local model parameters to the FL server that is further away, the vehicles and the RSUs only need to transmit them to the UAVs that are located nearer to them, of which the parameters are relayed to the FL server. Hence, as compared to the direct communication between the IoV components and the FL server, the UAVs help to improve this communication by reducing node failures which may be due to limited resources and energy capacity of the IoV components.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider that the model owner is interested in facilitating FL among IoV components (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Joint Auction-Coalition Formation Framework for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning in UAV-Enabled Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), e.g., for traffic prediction. For efficient FL training, the model owner announces the FL task and the number of training iterations. The interested workers upload their sampling rate to the model owner. The model owner then selects its workers accordingly based on the importance of each worker, which is computed based on the uploaded sampling rates. Since the workers may not have sufficient resources, i.e., transmission power and communication bandwidth for efficient FL, the workers can utilize UAVs which have the required resources to facilitate the FL tasks. Firstly, the workers will conduct model training with their local datasets. Then, instead of sending the local model parameters to the remote FL server directly, the workers upload their local model parameters to the UAVs, which in turn aggregate the accumulated model parameters for relay to the model owner. Thereafter, the model owner aggregates the model parameters to derive the global FL model. The model owner will then announce the global FL model parameters to the workers for another round of FL training. The process continues until the number of iterations announced by the model owner is reached.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">There are two advantages to this proposed approach. Firstly, the privacy of the workers is preserved since only local parameters of the workers are exchanged with the UAVs and the data of the workers remains locally at the workers’ site. Secondly, with the help of UAVs, communication efficiency is increased, resulting in reduction of link and node failure.</p>

<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">However, a single UAV may not have sufficient energy to last for the entire training duration and other resources for the FL training process. As such, the UAVs may cooperate with other UAVs to ensure that the edge aggregation and communications with the model owner are provided throughout the entire FL training process. To model the cooperation among the UAVs, we propose a coalition formation approach among cooperating UAVs. In order to incentivize UAVs to participate in the FL training, the UAVs are rewarded for their contributions if they complete the FL training process. The UAVs receive different payoffs for supporting FL training process for different cells of workers as the importance of the workers varies. In addition, the workers have preference for different UAVs. In order to elicit the valuations of cells of workers for each coalition of profit-maximizing UAVs, we propose an auction scheme. Each cell of workers submit their bids to each coalition of UAVs. Collectively, the profit-maximizing UAVs evaluate all possible coalitional structure formation and decide on the optimal allocation of UAVs. Since the UAVs are profit-maximizing, it is possible that there are two or more UAV coalitions which want to be allocated to the same cell of workers. In such a situation, based on the bids of the cells of workers, which also represent preferences of the cells of workers, the more preferred UAV coalition gets the allocation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">The main goal of this work is to develop a joint auction-coalition formation framework of UAVs towards enabling efficient FL for IoV networks. The integration of coalition formations of UAVs and optimal bidding of cells of workers makes the proposed framework suitable for the FL training process as it ensures that the UAVs have sufficient resources to complete the FL tasks and at the same time, optimally allocates the profit-maximizing UAV coalitions to the groups of IoV components.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A number of recent studies investigate on the effective deployment of FL algorithms over the wireless networks. Several fundamental issues such as the optimal allocation of resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the development of efficient algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and the design of incentive mechanisms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> are current active research areas in FL. One of the main challenges in FL is communication inefficiency. In particular, the synchronous FL protocol implies that each training iteration only takes place as quickly as the slowest device, i.e., the straggler’s effect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. As such, the dropped or straggling devices can lower the efficiency of FL training. The reduction of communication cost in the federated network setting can be achieved by reducing the total number of communication iterations or by reducing the size of transmitted data in each iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In order to minimize convergence time while optimizing performance, the study of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> looks into probabilistic user selection scheme and artificial neural networks. Given the faster convergence time, the end devices have greater capabilities to complete the FL training process. The study of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposes to use structured and sketched updates to reduce communication cost in dealing with a large number of users over unreliable network connections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from the studies that focus on the improvement of transmission efficiency in the wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, due to the inherent attributes of UAVs such as flexibility, mobility and adaptive altitude, there are an increasing number of UAV applications in wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The growing capabilities of the UAVs have demonstrated their potential to be deployed in numerous applications, e.g., environmental sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, mobile edge computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and traffic surveillance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. In particular, UAVs are also increasingly being considered in IoV-related applications for more efficient Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in the development of smart cities. The study of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> provides a solution in counting the number of cars based on images provided by the UAVs. The aerial images taken by the UAVs are used to track vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Moreover, UAVs are also used as aerial mobile base station for cellular traffic offloading <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Several studies such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> have been conducted on the optimal placement of the UAVs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies consider using UAVs for efficient FL. The involvement of UAVs as wireless relays between the IoV components and the FL server can greatly improve the communication efficiency of the FL training process by improving the connectivity and increasing the coverage of the IoV components.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the limitation of a single UAV in carrying out complex tasks, coalition formation games for tasks allocation have been investigated. The cooperation of multiple UAVs to maximize the coverage utility of the UAV network is considered in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which is useful in crowdsensing tasks to gather more data covering larger areas for more accurate analysis. A leader-follower approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> is also widely used by the UAVs to form multiple coalitions in order to complete designated tasks with minimal resources. The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> considers coalition formations for tasks allocation taking into account tasks priority and requiring the UAVs to arrive simultaneously for task completion. However, these coalition formations approaches do not jointly consider the importance of the tasks that the UAVs perform and the optimal allocation of the UAVs to complete the tasks, subject to the resource constraints of the UAVs. Besides that, the preferences of the workers for heterogeneous UAVs are not considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To that end, in order to elicit the preferences of workers for the heterogeneous UAVs, we adopt an auction-based approach in our coalition formation design for task allocation. The use of sequential auction mechanism is proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> by considering the UAVs with limited communication range. However, it only considers one UAV in serving a task, whereas a single UAV may not be able to support a cell of workers for the entire FL training process in our model. The study of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> explores the leader-follower approach where the leader UAVs auction for other UAVs to form coalitions that are adaptive to the changes in task workload and capabilities of the UAVs. The work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposes a multi-layered cost computation method to calculate the price of the bid. While the study of auction design is well-explored in tasks allocation, where the bid winner is often determined by the bid with lowest cost or the bid with the highest utility, the valuation of a coalitional structure using an auction approach is often not considered.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a UAV-assisted FL network over the IoV paradigm. The system model is comprised of an FL model owner which announces crowdsensing tasks to a group of selected FL workers. The FL workers which complete the crowdsensing tasks are responsible for labelling the data and training the model on their own local datasets. In order to perform data labelling for model training, the FL workers can leverage the knowledge, i.e., labels from a source-domain party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Thereafter, the local model parameters will be uploaded to the FL model owner for model aggregation. Since the communication efficiency between the model owner and the cell of workers is low due to link failure and missing nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, UAVs are introduced to facilitate the network to improve the communication efficiency of the FL model.</p>

The workers with low sampling rate and low quality are of low importance as there is insufficient data for the FL training process. The workers upload their sampling rates to the model owner, which in turn computes the importance of each worker. Since the design for incentive mechanisms that guarantee the truthfulness of the workers’ sampling rates is not the focus of this paper, existing incentive mechanisms such as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> can be implemented to ensure that the workers upload their true sampling rates.

After selecting the workers, the model owner announces an FL model that will be trained over <math id="S3.p2.11.m11.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p2.11.m11.1a"><mi id="S3.p2.11.m11.1.1" xref="S3.p2.11.m11.1.1.cmml">μ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p2.11.m11.1b"><ci id="S3.p2.11.m11.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p2.11.m11.1.1">𝜇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p2.11.m11.1c">\mu</annotation></semantics></math> iterations.

The UAVs only collect the local model parameters from the individual workers after their model training and then perform edge aggregation before transmitting the aggregated local model parameters to the FL model owner. This ensures that the data belonging to the workers is not exchanged with any third parties, consequently preserving the data privacy. To improve communication efficiency, the UAVs need to ensure that they have sufficient energy to stay in the air throughout the entire FL process. In order to incentivise the UAVs to complete the FL training process, the workers will make a payment to the UAVs. In fact, the UAVs always maximize their payoffs. However, the individual UAVs may lack the energy capacities to stay in the air throughout the entire FL training process, and they cannot support certain cells of workers. As a result, the UAVs can consider to form coalitions. Note that each coalition of UAVs can only choose to facilitate the FL training process in one of the cells of workers. In order to elicit the willingness of payment of each cell of workers, an auction scheme is also explored to investigate the optimal allocation that maximizes the profits of the UAVs. To perform the auction process, the UAVs and the workers keep each other informed of their locations.</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In our system model, we consider the use of UAVs to facilitate the FL training process by improving the communication efficiency between the FL workers and the FL model owner. At the same time, the UAVs can be used to support other types of users such as the typical mobile users, which generate background traffic for the UAVs. An extension to our system model to include different types of users, is straightforward and can be considered in the future work. Note that with greater computational and communication capabilities to support more IoV components for the training of FL models with higher accuracy level, the operational cost of involving the UAVs in the model training may be higher than that without using the UAVs.</p>

Then, the second nearest UAV in the same coalition takes over, aggregates the local model parameters and transmits the aggregated local model parameters to the model owner. Similarly, after the second nearest UAV completes its task, the third nearest UAV takes over and continues the process. If the maximum number of iterations that the UAV can support is greater than the remaining number of iterations of the FL training process, the UAV just needs to support the remaining number of iterations. If the required number of iterations announced by the model owner is completed by the nearer UAVs in a coalition, the farther UAVs do not need to support any iteration of the FL training process. For fairness purposes, since each UAV in the coalition completes different number of iterations, the profit earned by each UAV in the coalition depends on the number of iterations it completes.</p>

It is worth noting that the preference relation is defined to quantify the preferences of the players, which can be application-specific. For example, the IoV components prefer UAVs that are nearer for road safety applications but prefer UAVs that provide higher bandwidth for entertainment services. It can represent a function of parameters such as the utility gain by joining the coalition.</p>

Meanwhile, the valuations of the cells for the UAVs depend on the latency of the task, i.e., how quickly the model parameters are transmitted to the model owner. As such, the cells of workers have more incentive to employ UAVs that are nearer to them since shorter time is required for them to reach the cell to facilitate FL training. Although the FL training process starts as soon as the nearest UAV in a coalition reaches the cell of workers, the valuation of the cell of workers for the UAV coalition does not depend on the nearest UAV in the coalition.

<p id="S5.SS1.p7.8" class="ltx_p">The traditional first-price auction, in which the highest bidder pays the exact bid it submits, maximizes the revenue of the seller, but does not guarantee that the bidders submit their true valuations. In other words, the bidders have incentives to not submit their true valuations. In particular, if the bidder bids lower and wins the bid, its utility increases. Hence, by adopting the first-price auction, the property of incentive compatibility of the auction is not guaranteed. As such, the second-price auction is adopted to determine the payment price of the bid winners where the bid winners need to pay only the price equals the winning bid if the original bid winner is not considered in the auction. The payment price is determined to incentivize the cells of workers to honestly report their true valuations such that the valuations of the cells of workers are equal to their bids, i.e., <math

The time complexity of the proposed algorithm depends on the number of attempts of the merge and split operations. Since for each attempt involves the auction-based allocation of which the time complexity increases linearly with the number of cells of workers, the overall time complexity of the proposed algorithm is given by the multiplication of the number of merge and split attempts and the complexity of the auction-based allocation.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To illustrate the preference analysis of the cells of workers, we first consider the scenario in which each UAV facilitates the FL training in the cells individually, i.e., no coalition is formed yet. Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ VI-B Preference of Cells of Workers ‣ VI Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Joint Auction-Coalition Formation Framework for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning in UAV-Enabled Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> illustrates the preference of each cell for each UAV. Cell 1 prefers UAV 3 the most. For Cell 2 and Cell 3, it is clearly seen that both cells prefer UAV 6. This is mainly because UAV 3 is nearest to Cell 1, whereas UAV 6 is nearest to Cell 2 and Cell 3. In addition to that, all cells do not submit any valuation for both UAV 1 and UAV 2 as they cannot individually fulfil the number of iterations required for the FL task. This is because UAV 1 and UAV 2 have low energy capacities (as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ VI-B Preference of Cells of Workers ‣ VI Simulation Results and Analysis ‣ Joint Auction-Coalition Formation Framework for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning in UAV-Enabled Internet of Vehicles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>), thereby they are not able to support any cell individually.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the allocation of UAVs to the cells solely based on the valuations submitted by the cells may not benefit the UAVs. Taking Cell 2 as an example. If only a single UAV is considered in supporting a cell, Cell 2 will lose out to Cell 3 in the bidding process for UAV 6 since Cell 3 bids higher for UAV 6. As a result, Cell 2 is left with UAV 3, UAV 4 and UAV 5 to bid for. Among the remaining choices, Cell 2 prefers UAV 3 the most. Thus, Cell 1 will lose out to Cell 2 in bidding for UAV 3 and thus, with UAV 4 as the most preferred choice among the remaining UAVs. It may not be economically efficient for UAV 4 to be allocated to Cell 1 as it is far away from Cell 1. The energy needed for UAV 4 to travel to Cell 1 and back to its original position may offset the profit earned in supporting the FL training process in Cell 1. On the other hand, it may be more cost-effective for UAV 1 and UAV 3 to cooperate to support Cell 1 since the energy needed to reach Cell 1 is smaller.</p>

For example, coalition {1,2,3} is equally preferred by Cell 1 as coalitions <math id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{1,3\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.2.1" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">{</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.2.cmml">3</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.2.3" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2b"><set id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.1.1">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2.2">3</cn></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p6.1.m1.2c">\{1,3\}</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{1,2\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.2" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.2.1" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml">{</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.2.cmml">2</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.2.3" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2b"><set id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.1.1">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2.2">2</cn></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p6.2.m2.2c">\{1,2\}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{3\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.1" xref="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.1.cmml">{</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.1.cmml">3</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.1.cmml">}</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1b"><set id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2"><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.1">3</cn></set></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p6.3.m3.1c">\{3\}</annotation></semantics></math>.

It is obvious that the larger the energy capacity of the UAV, the larger the number of iterations that the UAV can support. Individually, UAV 1 and UAV 2 do not choose to support any cell as the possible profit earned in supporting any cell is negative. For UAV 1 and UAV 2, since the valuation bids of all cells are zero, it is natural not to support any cell as they are not earning any revenue. Meanwhile, the profit-maximizing property of the UAVs has resulted in the competition of UAV 3, UAV 4, UAV 5 and UAV 6 to facilitate FL training in the same cell, i.e., Cell 3. However, by allocating UAV 3, UAV 4, UAV 5 and UAV 6 to Cell 3, the revenue earned does not increase but the cost increases which contribute to the overall smaller profit earned. Thus, it is possible to allocate one of the UAVs to another cell such that the overall profit of the UAVs is higher, which is discussed in the next subsection.</p>

When the cooperation cost is more than or equal to 4, the UAVs prefer to support the FL training process in the cells individually and not to form any coalition where UAV 3, UAV 4 and UAV 6 are allocated to Cell 2, Cell 1 and Cell 6 respectively. In other words, it is not cost-effective for the UAVs to form coalition anymore.

Firstly, it is possible to form a smaller coalition to support a cell of workers such that there is no need for a larger UAV coalition.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a joint auction-coalition formation framework of UAVs to facilitate resource-constrained IoV components in completing the FL tasks. Firstly, we design an auction scheme where each cell of workers submit its bids to all possible coalitions of UAVs based on their importance of the cells and the distance between the cells and the UAVs. Then, we use the merge-and-split algorithm to decide on the optimal coalitional structure that maximizes the total profit of the UAVs.</p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For our future work, we can consider more factors in determining the coalition formation of UAVs. For example, we can take into account the social properties of the UAVs when they form coalitions such that malicious UAVs can be identified and eliminated so that the FL performance is not adversely affected. Furthermore, we can consider a joint trajectory optimization and energy efficient coalition formation game in order to complete the FL tasks more efficiently.</p>
