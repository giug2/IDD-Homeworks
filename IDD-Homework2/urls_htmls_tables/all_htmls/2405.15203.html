<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Aerial-view human detection has a large demand for large-scale data to capture more diverse human appearances compared to ground-view human detection. Therefore, synthetic data can be a good resource to expand data, but the domain gap with real-world data is the biggest obstacle to its use in training. As a common solution to deal with the domain gap, the <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sim2real transformation</em> is used, and its quality is affected by three factors: i) the real data serving as a reference when calculating the domain gap, ii) the synthetic data chosen to avoid the transformation quality degradation, and iii) the synthetic data pool from which the synthetic data is selected. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these factors on maximizing the effectiveness of synthetic data in training in terms of improving learning performance and acquiring domain generalization ability–two main benefits expected of using synthetic data. As an evaluation metric for the second benefit, we introduce a method for measuring the distribution gap between two datasets, which is derived as the normalized sum of the Mahalanobis distances of all test data. As a result, we have discovered several important findings that have never been investigated or have been used previously without accurate understanding. We expect that these findings can break the current trend of either naively using or being hesitant to use synthetic data in machine learning due to the lack of understanding, leading to more appropriate use in future research.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Advances in aerial-view human detection have lagged significantly behind the conventional human detection, which typically deals with ground-view images. This is because there is a lack of real-world data that sufficiently includes the human appearance, which becomes very diverse when viewed from the air compared to when viewed from the ground. Therefore, the demand for synthetic data grows as additional data that can expand the human appearance from the aerial-view in the data. Many attempts<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> to use synthetic data for training data augmentation have been made in aerial-view human detection, but properly creating synthetic data relevant to given learning tasks remains a challenge. That is mainly because fully exploiting the inherent strengths of synthetic data requires an appropriate understanding of various properties inducing the domain gap compared to real data.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A common solution for bridging the domain gap is to transform the properties of synthetic data to enhance realism. In general, the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sim2real</em> transformers are trained on a source-to-target adaptation framework (<em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span>, conditional GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>), treating synthetic and real data as the source and target domains, respectively. However, the satisfactory quality of the sim2real transformation cannot be expected if the domain gap between the two sets is not manageable to overcome. One effective way to deal with this dilemma, where the sim2real transformation to handle the large domain gap is negatively affected by the large domain gap, is to use only a portion of synthetic data with a small domain gap with the real data. To take advantage of the diversity of synthetic data in training, data with relatively large domain gaps can also be selected at a lower rate. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> In summary, there are three factors that affect sim2real transformation quality (Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data for Aerial-view Human Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>): i) the real data serving as a reference when measuring the domain gap, ii) the selected synthetic data used in training, and iii) the synthetic data pool from which a subset of synthetic data is selected. To maximize the impact of synthetic data in training while adequately addressing the domain gap, a thorough investigation into how the three factors play into optimally integrating synthetic data into learning is critical in aerial-view human detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we evaluated the impact of synthetic data in a same-domain task where the training and test sets were built on the same domain, and a cross-domain task where the two sets were from different domains. With the two tasks, we aim to ensure the following two benefits of using synthetic data in training are realized: i) improving learning performance by training with hybrid sets of real and synthetic data, and ii) leading the model to acquire domain generalization ability to achieve satisfactory accuracy regardless of the dataset in a cross-domain task. To do that, we firstly evaluated the model performance. We also measured the distribution gap between the training and test sets in a cross-domain task with and without using synthetic data in training to specifically confirm the second benefit. As a measure of the distribution gap, we use the cross-entropy while representing the distributions of the two sets as a multivariate Gaussian distribution and a mixture of Delta distribution, respectively. We have shown that, theoretically, the distribution for a certain category of a training set used in detector training can be represented as a multivariate Gaussian distribution in the detector’s representation space. In the end, the distribution gap can be derived as the normalized sum of the Mahalanobis distances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> from the training set for each test data.</p>

This is because off-the-shelf models developed for ground-view detection also perform well in aerial-view human detection on general benchmarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.

To cope with this data-scarce situation, which is difficult to avoid in aerial-view human detection, several attempts have been made to expand the training data, <em id="S2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="S2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text"></span>, generating novel-view images from existing images via NeRF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> or using synthetic data developed for aerial-view human detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.

Statistical measures over the distances between samples of different datasets in the <em id="S2.p2.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">feature space</em> are also considered to estimate the distribution gap of the datasets. Here, the feature space can be learned in a direction of preserving the properties of the synthetic data in the sim2real transformation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> or minimizing the feature distribution of two datasets through contrastive learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> or knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Analysis in terms of accuracy.</span> In same-domain tasks (Fig. <a href="#S5.F2.sf1" title="Figure 2(a) ‣ Figure 2 ‣ 5.1 A Study on the Impact of Real Data ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data for Aerial-view Human Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(a)</span></a>), detection accuracy unsurprisingly increased proportionally with the size of the real dataset, regardless of whether or not synthetic data is used. The use of synthetic data consistently increases accuracy irrespective of the size of the real data set. Interestingly, adopting a larger real dataset yields better accuracy even in most cross-domain tasks (Fig. <a href="#S5.F2.sf2" title="Figure 2(b) ‣ Figure 2 ‣ 5.1 A Study on the Impact of Real Data ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data for Aerial-view Human Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(b)</span></a>). These trends indicate that it is essential to use synthetic data with real data, including cross-domain tasks.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Using a large number of real images (<em id="S5.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S5.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, 200), on the other hand, results in little increase or adversely affects accuracy compared to using fewer images. The rationale behind this notable observation can be accounted for with Fig. <a href="#S5.F2.sf3" title="Figure 2(c) ‣ Figure 2 ‣ 5.1 A Study on the Impact of Real Data ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data for Aerial-view Human Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2(c)</span></a>, which illustrates the accuracy ratio of a cross-domain task to a same-domain task. Here, the two tasks use different training sets (for the cross-domain task, we use VisDrone as the training set.) but are evaluated on the same test set. When the number of real images is small, the cross-domain presents similar or better accuracy than the same-domain. However, the effectiveness of the cross-domain continues to decrease as the number of real images increases.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">These analyses strongly indicate that <em id="S5.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">synthetic data is effective in both same-domain and cross-domain tasks, particularly the impact of synthetic images is more significant when the amount of real data is small and then it continues to diminish as the amount of real data increases</em>. These findings fully confirm that synthetic data can greatly enhance learning in the data scarcity realm, where real data are hard to obtain if adequately integrated into learning.</p>

Firstly, PTL consistently provides better accuracy than random selection, regardless of training settings, for both the same domain and cross-domain tasks (Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 A Study on the Impact of Synthetic Data ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data for Aerial-view Human Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). On the other hand, random selection is generally more effective in reducing the distribution gap using synthetic data than PTL (Tab. <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.2 A Study on the Impact of Synthetic Data ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data for Aerial-view Human Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). When selecting synthetic images from the synthetic pool, PTL focuses more on synthetic images with similar characteristics to the reference dataset more frequently than simply increasing the generalization ability of the training set. As this selection strategy is proposed to prevent degradation of the sim2real transformation quality, using higher-quality transformed synthetic images in training has a positive impact on increasing detection accuracy.</p>

To examine the effect of each parameter on using synthetic data, we construct five subsets of the synthetic data pool, where each is built more sparsely for one parameter while fixing the values of other parameters. Each sub-pool includes the synthetic data with sparsely and regularly sampled altitudes (SAlt), radii (SRad), viewing angles (SAng), human characters (SCha), or human poses (SPos). In addition to the regularly sampled sub-pools, we also construct extremely biased sampled sub-pools along the three parameters: altitudes, radii, and viewing angles. For altitude and radii, subsets (BSAlt and BSRad) were constructed by collecting images assuming that the camera location is far away, and for viewing angle, a subset (BSAng) was constructed with only images with the front view of a person. These additional sub-pools can be used to investigate the impact of low-diversity synthetic pools when leveraging synthetic data in training.<span id="footnote6" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">6</span>Details on how to build subsets of the synthetic data pool are provided in the supplementary material.</span></span></span></p>

In sampling the synthetic pool, reducing the variety of human poses significantly decreases detection accuracy as it leads to the inability to cover a wide range of human poses in test data. However, the decrease in accuracy is not observed when using subsets of synthetic data linked to the sparse sampling of other parameters.</p>

This strongly indicates that <em id="S5.SS3.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sampling synthetic data from a denser but less diverse distribution adversely affects using synthetic data in training, leading to low accuracy</em>. Moreover, ‘BSAlt’, which presents very low accuracy, has a very large domain gap to the reference data. Using synthetic pools with large domain gaps to the reference data adversely impacts accuracy in both same-domain and cross-domain tasks. Unexpectedly, when ‘BSAng’ was used, detection accuracy did not decrease, and the properties of the synthetic pool were normal. This is probably because the reference (real) data and other test real datasets also contain images of people looking straight ahead.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Through our comprehensive analysis based on the extensive experiments, we have brought to light valuable findings that have not been previously identified or have been used without an accurate understanding. Our findings are described as follows:</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">1) General mechanism for acquiring domain generalization ability.</span> Our experiments show that in cross-domain tasks, synthetic data has a major impact on reducing the distribution gaps from reference datasets for most data, resulting in remarkable increases in cross-domain accuracy. On the other hand, a considerable number of outlier data points unexpectedly had very large distribution gaps. Outliers may arise due to i) insufficient diversity of reference data that serves as a standard for collecting synthetic data and training the sim2real transformer, or ii) the inherent limitation of the synthetic data pool, which does not fully represent the entire cross-domain data. We further discuss the behavior of these factors (<em id="S6.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S6.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span> reference (real) data, sim2real transformation, synthetic data pool) affecting the acquisition of domain generalization ability in the following findings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">2) Relationship in scalability between synthetic data and real data.</span> Our experiments show that the more real images are used, the more positive is the impact of synthetic data on detection performance, not only in same-domain tasks but also in cross-domain tasks. Our experiments also indicate that as the amount of synthetic data used for training gradually increases, the accuracy continuously improves and then plateaus at some point. Impressively, the maximum number of synthetic images that can be used without accuracy plateauing increases as more real images are used. Therefore, to maximize the impact of synthetic data in training, it is important to increase the amount of not only synthetic data but also real data. Our findings on scalability may have some connections to the previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> searching for an optimal ratio between real and synthetic data in a training batch.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">3) Sim2real transformation quality <em id="S6.p4.1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">vs</em>. distribution gap.</span> Which is more important: improving the sim2real transformation quality or reducing the distribution gap between datasets to acquire domain generalization ability? The answer to this question is that improving the sim2real transformation quality is more important. In our experiments comparing PTL and random selection, PTL designed to prevent the sim2real transformation quality degradation was less effective than random selection in reducing the distribution gaps. However, PTL consistently yields better accuracy than random selection in most experimental settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">4) Effect of the synthetic data pool.</span> In our experiments, we analyzed how the properties of the synthetic data pool were related to the effectiveness of using synthetic data in training. Examining different properties of different synthetic data pools, we found that the density and diversity of pools are correlated with cross-domain detection accuracy. Therefore, we can select the optimal synthetic data pool to maximize the benefit of synthetic data by investigating the properties of the pool in advance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In closing, we expect that our illumination of these findings can help to break the current trend of either naively using or being hesitant to use synthetic data in computer vision applications, leading to more appropriate use of synthetic data in future research and practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Broader impacts.</span> The comprehensive study in this paper was conducted on tasks that place a high emphasis on synthetic data, <em id="S6.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S6.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span>, aerial-view human detection, few-shot learning, and cross-domain detection. While we can clearly see how various factors affecting the use of synthetic data in training considerably influence the results in these tasks, one can doubt if the findings here are generally applicable to other tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Numerical results regarding detection accuracy and distribution gaps in our work are based on the particular large-scale synthetic dataset and various real-world datasets publically available in the aerial-based perception domain. Therefore, when applying the findings discovered in this study to a task from relatively different applications where data attributes or characteristics are considerably different, an initial investigation into data and domain gap distributions needs to be considered to maximize the benefits of leveraging the findings in this study.</p>

Therefore, it is straightforward to derive the modeling for the sigmoid-based detector from the previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, who shows that the softmax-based classifier can be modeled with a multivariate Gaussian distribution in the representation space. However, our derivation is still meaningful in that it extends the applicability of an existing modeling limited to a certain type of classifier (<span id="Pt0.A1.SS1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, based on softmax) to general object detectors (<span id="Pt0.A1.SS1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, based on sigmoid). Most object detectors, especially one-stage detectors, generally use the sigmoid function, which does not consider other categories when calculating the model output for a certain category, since more than one category can be active on a single output.</p>

There are two notable differences: i) The two datasets being compared are represented as the multi-variate Gaussian distribution in the FID calculation, while only the reference dataset is represented as the multi-variate Gaussian distribution in our metric, ii) FID calculation is performed using features of the inception model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> trained on the ImageNet dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, while our metric uses features from the detector trained on the reference dataset. These differences occurred because FID determined the above characteristics for practical reasons, whereas our method derived them mathematically. In other words, there may be cases in which the evaluation with FID is not valid (<em id="Pt0.A1.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>.<span id="Pt0.A1.SS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text"></span>, the case where the dataset being compared has very different characteristics from the ImageNet dataset), but our metric is always valid if the prerequisite conditions are satisfied.</p>

The numbers of training epochs (used in sim2real transformer training) and training iterations (used in detector training) are modified to adopt a training time curtailment strategy. Specifically, in the original PTL, the sim2real transformer and detector are trained for 100 epochs and 6.0k iterations, respectively, but when adopting the strategy, they are trained for 20 epochs and 1.2k iterations, respectively, after the 0th iteration.</p>

In particular, while PTL is designed to select synthetic images by weighting images closer in domain gap to the training set, this selection is modified to randomly select synthetic data. All other parts except this selection process of the PTL training pipeline were used unchanged.</p>

Among different experimental settings, we present the scatter plots for three cases: i) testing on the Okutama-Action dataset in Vis-50, ii) testing on the SARD dataset in Vis-100, and iii) testing on the HERIDAL dataset in Vis-200. For reference, the first case is the same as the scatter plots in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 5 of the main manuscript. To better focus on the distribution of each scatter plot, scatter plots are shown separately for each size of synthetic data. In the main manuscript, these scatterplots are shown together in one figure to emphasize the differences between the plots. The observations of change in the scatter plots for the other two cases are similar to those in the first case, which has been analyzed in the main manuscript.</p>
