<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is emerging as a promising machine learning technique in the medical field for analyzing medical images, as it is considered an effective method to safeguard sensitive patient data and comply with privacy regulations. However, recent studies have revealed that the default settings of federated learning may inadvertently expose private training data to privacy attacks. Thus, the intensity of such privacy risks and potential mitigation strategies in the medical domain remain unclear. In this paper, we make three original contributions to privacy risk analysis and mitigation in federated learning for medical data. First, we propose a holistic framework, MedPFL, for analyzing privacy risks in processing medical data in the federated learning environment and developing effective mitigation strategies for protecting privacy. Second, through our empirical analysis, we demonstrate the severe privacy risks in federated learning to process medical images, where adversaries can accurately reconstruct private medical images by performing privacy attacks. Third, we illustrate that the prevalent defense mechanism of adding random noises may not always be effective in protecting medical images against privacy attacks in federated learning, which poses unique and pressing challenges related to protecting the privacy of medical data. Furthermore, the paper discusses several unique research questions related to the privacy protection of medical data in the federated learning environment. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark medical image datasets to analyze and mitigate the privacy risks associated with federated learning for medical data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is an emergent Machine Learning (ML) technique where training data is distributed across multiple clients instead of a central server to protect privacy. In this approach, the training occurs locally on each client (also known as participants) and the model parameters are aggregated on a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. One of the most significant advantages of FL is that it can mitigate the systemic privacy risks of traditional centralized ML by keeping the private data decentralized on the clients’ end and only sharing the extracted gradient updates to the central server. There are several additional benefits of FL except decentralizing the private training data including, scalability and efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. FL ensures scalability by allowing seamless integration of a large number of edge devices on clients into the learning process. It also demonstrates enhanced efficiency by collaborating among participating devices, which enables them to collectively contribute to updating the shared global model through their private training data. There are several FL algorithms prevalent such as FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, FedGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and ProxyFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the healthcare sector, the integration of ML and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithms are common for the analysis of diverse medical data such as medical images, health records, and text-based doctor’s advice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. These algorithms are also being utilized for prediction purposes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Those models help to make better decision and recommendation systems in the healthcare context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Additionally, FL emerged as a promising learning technique in the medical domain due to its decentralized nature of private training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. It facilitates keeping the patients’ sensitive health records private at their corresponding ends. FL ensures privacy-preserving ML by collaborating with multiple distributed clients, such as hospitals or clinics, without sharing sensitive raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Medical data, for example, X-ray images, diabetic test reports, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are considered highly sensitive records. Because those contain confidential details such as individuals’ names, dates of birth, and comprehensive medical histories, which collectively serve as unique identifiers of an individual. The exposure of such sensitive information can yield severe consequences for patients, ranging from social stigma and discrimination to potential job loss and insurance coverage denial. To mitigate these risks, numerous data protection regulations have been imposed globally, underscoring the critical importance of safeguarding individuals’ health-related information. The most common regulations include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> are the most common. These regulatory boards aim to ensure the privacy and security of medical data, shielding patients from the risk of unauthorized exposure. Thus, it ensures the robust security and confidentiality of healthcare data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although the primary purpose of FL is to prevent leaving private training data from local devices to mitigate privacy risks, recent studies outlined that the default privacy schema in FL is inadequate to prevent privacy leakage attacks. Studies revealed that FL systems are susceptible to privacy leakage attacks where the adversaries intercept the local gradient updates transmitted by the clients before model aggregation. It can reconstruct the clients’ private training data with high reconstruction accuracy, thus covertly and illegally exposing clients’ privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. This vulnerability poses a severe threat to the security of FL systems, compromising the protection of client privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The occurrence of such privacy attacks underscores the pressing need for robust privacy-preserving mechanisms within FL frameworks to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Protecting sensitive medical data from unauthorized access is crucial to uphold confidentiality, privacy, and the trust of patients so that legal standards can be met, and patients’ privacy can be safeguarded. Despite the benefits, FL faces significant privacy vulnerabilities that pose serious threats to its application in the medical domain. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate these privacy risks and devise effective mitigation strategies to defend against privacy attacks targeting FL applications within the healthcare domain. The key contributions of this paper are as follows.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The adoption of FL within the medical domain has been accelerated, primarily to safeguard private medical data while training ML models for tasks such as COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and skin disease detection using dermoscopy images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, recent studies have shown the inherent privacy-related challenges in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Despite numerous efforts to obscure personal health data, there remains a risk of patient information being re-identified, as evidenced by studies showcasing the potential re-identification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> of individuals from DICOM images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, adversaries could steal the data or access the algorithm from non-encrypted networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Medical images have been reported to be susceptible to adversarial attacks due to numerous reasons, such as ambiguous ground truth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and highly standardized format <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the default settings of FL are still insufficient to protect the privacy of medical images. The aforementioned studies have only shown how medical images (e.g., X-ray, and MRI scans) can be leaked from the various FL environments. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not yet a comprehensive framework for analyzing and mitigating privacy risks in FL to protect private medical data.
Moreover, the stringent regulations on medical data protection, coupled with their distinct characteristics compared with generic data, make it imperative and much more challenging to investigate and develop effective privacy-preserving techniques for protecting medical data. For example, we highlight below several unique features of medical images.</p>

The basic concept of poisoning attacks in FL refers to a scenario where a malicious user from the participants in the FL inserts poisonous data samples or parameters intending to malfunction the whole system. Poisoning can happen in both data level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and model level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. For data poisoning attacks in FL, malicious clients inject mislabeled, corrupted, or poisoned data into their local training data and attempt to update the global model with the poisoned data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. That eventually yields degraded performance of the system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, which is the primary goal of the data poisoning attack. On the other hand, in poisoning attacks, rather than modifying the training data directly, the attacker/malicious client intentionally manipulates the gradient updates before sending them to the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Backdoor attacks are also prevalent in the FL setting, where the attacker aims to inject a desired malicious task into the existing model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>

Several privacy leakage attack techniques have been proposed including Client Privacy Leakage (CPL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, Improved DLG (iDLG) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, and Inverting Gradients (GradInv) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. These attack methods illustrate that the default privacy scheme in FL might not offer adequate protection against privacy leakage attacks in the default FL environment. These attack methods underscore the need for enhanced privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL to effectively safeguard participants’ sensitive data. Random noise insertion, e.g., Gaussian noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> or Laplacian noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> might be an effective method for defending against privacy attacks in deep learning models. However, there is a significant lack of comprehensive and systematic studies addressing the potential threats posed by these privacy attacks to medical data within FL settings.</p>

Therefore, the extent of vulnerability of FL applications in the medical sector to privacy attacks lacks in-depth studies, along with the optimal approaches for mitigating such risks. This poses critical challenges in employing FL for processing sensitive private medical data, such as skin cancer images, X-ray images, and MRI scans of patients. Addressing these gaps in understanding is imperative for ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive medical data within FL frameworks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Attack Success Rate (ASR)</span> is the percentage of the number of successfully reconstructed samples over the number of samples attacked <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Mean Squared Error (MSE)</span> is used to quantify the average squared difference between the pixel values of two images, providing a numerical measure of the dissimilarity or error between them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>.
Lower MSE implies higher image similarity, implying smaller average pixel intensity differences, while higher MSE implies greater dissimilarity with larger average differences. MSE is used for evaluating both attack and defense mechanisms in this study. Since MSE refers to the difference between the original private image and the attack reconstructed one, for the attack methods, the lower MSE values indicate the attack is more successful, and exactly the opposite for the defense.</p>

It ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values implying greater image similarity. SSIM is used for evaluating both attack and defense mechanisms.

The GradInv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> attack is basically conducted by leveraging the gradients, <math id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\nabla L_{k}(\omega_{t})" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.cmml"><mo rspace="0.167em" id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1.cmml">∇</mo><msub id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.2.cmml">L</mi><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.3.cmml">k</mi></msub></mrow><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><msub id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">ω</mi><mi id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1"><times id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.2"></times><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3"><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.1">∇</ci><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.2">𝐿</ci><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.3.2.3">𝑘</ci></apply></apply><apply id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝜔</ci><ci id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p1.6.m6.1c">\nabla L_{k}(\omega_{t})</annotation></semantics></math>, of the local training data to reconstruct the original images utilizing a network composed of fully-connected layers.

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we present the performance comparison of the four attack methods that we investigated in this research (i.e., CPL, DLG, iDLG, and GradInv) on different medical image datasets in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VI-C Performance of Attack Methods ‣ VI Experimental Analysis ‣ In-depth Analysis of Privacy Threats in Federated Learning for Medical Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. We chose 100 randomly sampled images for all the attack methods for all three datasets.

In our experiment, we found very high MSE values and very low SSIM values between the original training image and the reconstructed one for several attack failure cases in various attack methods. We show some of the samples from the iDLG attack method in Figure <a href="#S6.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ VI-A Dataset Properties and Preprocessing ‣ VI Experimental Analysis ‣ In-depth Analysis of Privacy Threats in Federated Learning for Medical Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> along with their corresponding high MSE and low SSIM values. Such high MSE and low SSIM values, i.e., attack failure cases, might cause bias in the attack performance evaluation.

We observed that the performance of GradInv is better on the untrained ResNet-18 model than the trained ResNet-18 in terms of all evaluation metrics (higher ASR, higher SSIM, and lower MSE). However, the reconstruction process of the GradInv attack for the original private medical image on the untrained ResNet-18 takes a little more time than the trained ResNet-18, which is consistent with the results of GradInv <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.

Comparing the performance of CPL, DLG, and iDLG (in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VI-C Performance of Attack Methods ‣ VI Experimental Analysis ‣ In-depth Analysis of Privacy Threats in Federated Learning for Medical Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>), we observe that GradInv can reconstruct high-quality images by analyzing models with advanced architecture, such as ResNet-18. Though GradInv takes much longer time than CPL, DLG, and iDLG, the performance is better (sometimes similar) in terms of reconstruction quality as well as ASR evaluation metric.</p>

From these visual examples, it can be clearly observed that the lowest level of noise (100) is enough to protect the content of CIFAR-10 images. On the other hand, by looking at the medical images of all datasets, even if we add the highest level of noise (400), a major portion of the contents is still visible, which may reveal their categories. Thus, it requires further studies to build a strong defense for medical images.</p>

We observe a slight performance drop for reconstructed images by CPL, and a significant drop occurred for the recovered data under perturbed gradients at any noise levels in terms of classification accuracy for the generic image dataset (CIFAR-10). On the contrary, for all medical image datasets under the perturbed gradients, although we observed a slight performance drop in the classification accuracy, it still remains high. The reason behind such high accuracy is that even if we added the highest level of noise to the gradients, most of the contents were visible for all medical images (see medical images in Figure <a href="#S7.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ VII Discussion ‣ In-depth Analysis of Privacy Threats in Federated Learning for Medical Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>).

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces MedPFL, a framework designed to facilitate the analysis and mitigation of privacy risks associated with medical images in the FL environment. We demonstrate the substantial privacy risks inherent in utilizing FL for medical data processing, where sensitive patient data can be susceptible to recovery by adversaries through various privacy attacks. In our study, we employ different levels of random noise as a defense mechanism against these privacy attacks. However, we observe that while higher levels of noise can offer stronger privacy protection, however, adding random noise may not always adequately safeguard medical images within FL environments. Through the experiments of real-world scenarios involving multiple privacy attacks on medical images across three benchmark datasets, we underscore the critical challenges associated with mitigating privacy risks within FL, particularly within the medical domain. In the future, we intend to explore other types of privacy attacks and devise innovative privacy-preserving techniques tailored specifically to safeguarding medical data within FL settings. Also, we plan to incorporate different learning tasks, e.g., medical image segmentation into the MedPFL framework.</p>
