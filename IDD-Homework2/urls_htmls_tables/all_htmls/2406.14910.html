<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a viable technique to train a shared machine learning model without sharing data. Hierarchical FL (HFL) system has yet to be studied regrading its multiple levels of energy, computation, communication, and client scheduling, especially when it comes to clients relying on energy harvesting to power their operations. This paper presents a new two-phase deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework, referred to as “TP-DDPG”, to balance online the learning delay and model accuracy of an FL process in an energy harvesting-powered HFL system. The key idea is that we divide optimization decisions into two groups, and employ DDPG to learn one group in the first phase, while interpreting the other group as part of the environment to provide rewards for training the DDPG in the second phase. Specifically, the DDPG learns the selection of participating clients, and their CPU configurations and the transmission powers. A new straggler-aware client association and bandwidth allocation (SCABA) algorithm efficiently optimizes the other decisions and evaluates the reward for the DDPG. Experiments demonstrate that with substantially reduced number of learnable parameters, the TP-DDPG can quickly converge to effective polices that can shorten the training time of HFL by 39.4% compared to its benchmarks, when the required test accuracy of HFL is 0.9.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the advent of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), pervasively deployed devices are revolutionizing the way we live and work, by producing vast amounts of data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Virtual reality, autonomous driving, and intelligent inference can be enabled by applying deep learning to the rich data.
As a collaborative decentralized machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) is becoming increasingly popular, where IoT devices, namely, clients, download global models from parameter servers, update their local models, and upload the local models for iterative global model updates to the parameter server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Allowing the model to be updated locally, FL can protect sensitive local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and substantially reduce the burden on network backbones since the models are typically much more lightweight than the data samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The key challenge of FL systems arises from restrictive resources, including finite (and limited) computing power and communication bandwidth, especially in the face of the straggler effect. The straggler effect occurs when each training round only progresses as fast as the slowest client in a synchronous FL process, since the central server has to wait for all clients to complete local training before a global aggregation can take place <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The slowest client is known as the straggler, which increases the training latency of FL.
First, due to the limited bandwidth and heterogeneous clients, it is necessary to select appropriate clients to participate in FL and guarantee learning accuracy, while allocating the computation and communication resources efficiently to minimize the learning delay. Densely distributed clients can usually communicate with multiple edge servers, making client association decisions difficult. Moreover, the clients of FL, e.g., sensor nodes in remote areas, are usually powered by finite batteries. Effective energy management is critical to making full use of constrained batteries. As a result, joint optimization of energy, computation and communication resource allocation, and client scheduling is non-trivial to create effective FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Many existing FL studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> assumed a cloud server or an edge server as the parameter server, namely cloud- or edge-based FL. However, cloud-based FL can cause a large amount of delay and a high drop-out rate due to communication problems with the cloud server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. On the contrary, although edge-based FL can meet benefit from low latency and high reliability, its training performance inevitably declines due to relatively few clients that the edge server can access.
A new client-edge-cloud hierarchical FL (HFL) system was recently proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, where edge servers serve as intermediaries between the cloud server and clients. Such a hierarchical architecture takes advantage of the cloud- and edge-based FL. On the one hand, the clients can send local models to the nearby edge servers rather than the cloud server for edge aggregation, thereby decreasing the delay and drop rate due to proximate accesses. On the other hand, multiple rounds of edge aggregations are performed before uploading the updated models to the cloud, aggregating a wider coverage of clients and resulting in a more accurate FL model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Yet, making appropriate resource allocation or client scheduling decisions for HFL is challenging due to the complex communication and learning mechanism of HFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a new framework to comprehensively optimize client scheduling (i.e., client selection and association) and resource allocation (including energy, computation, and communication) for HFL.
We consider the clients equipped with rechargeable batteries and relying on the renewable energy harvested from their environment to power local model training and uploading, which has never been studied in the literature, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
A new Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based framework, named two-phase DDPG (TP-DDPG), is developed to
adjust client scheduling and resource allocation adapting to the time-varying wireless channels and renewable energy arrivals, thereby balancing the learning delay and model accuracy of HFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Apart from its new consideration of energy harvesting-powered clients and comprehensiveness of the problem tackled, a key contribution of the TP-DDPG framework is that we interpret the client association and bandwidth allocation as part of the environment. An algorithm, named straggler-aware client association and bandwidth allocation (SCABA), is developed to optimize the client association and bandwidth allocation (in the second phase of each iteration of TP-DDPG). SCABA relies on decisions made by a DDPG agent on client selection, transmit power, and CPU configuration (in the first phase), thereby generating rewards for the DDPG agent.
With the unique and optimal solution of SCABA, the DDPG agent can be trained effectively by interacting with the environment through SCABA. The number of decisions the DDPG agent needs to make is substantially reduced. Consequently, the DDPG can converge rapidly and reliably.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Extensive experimental results are carried out to assess the proposed TP-DDPG algorithm.
With its substantially reduced learnable action space, the TP-DDPG can rapidly converge to effective policies that can shorten the training time of HFL by 39.4% compared to its benchmarks when the required test accuracy of HFL is 0.9 based on the MNIST dataset. TP-DDPG also enables HFL to converge to the highest accuracy of 0.93 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while the accuracy is lower than 0.9 for all the benchmarks. This two-stage, latency-sensitive FL architecture can be integrated with edge computing infrastructure to perform real-time AI inference and decision-making at the network edge. This is particularly beneficial for applications, where data needs to be processed locally, such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Several pioneering works have attempted to optimize resource allocation or client scheduling policies for HFL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. These studies usually considered a static cloud aggregation process (or global iteration), for which fixed resource allocation and/or client scheduling decisions were made off-line, e.g., using game theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, convex approximation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, and alternating optimization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. These studies, in general, cannot adapt to dynamically changing HFL systems with time-varying wireless channels. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has the potential to adapt to environmental changes, the existing DRL-based solutions, i.e., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, were designed to perform client scheduling and resource allocation one-off (or off-line) and would suffer from limited scalability, if employed online, due to a direct collection of all actions in their action spaces and consequently relatively large action spaces.
On the other hand, energy harvesting technology is a key enabler of energy-efficient and self-sustainable HFL systems where the clients are powered by constrained batteries, but it has yet to be considered in these HFL systems. The incorporation of energy harvesting-powered clients would also require client scheduling and resource allocation to adapt to changing energy arrivals, in addition to the time-varying wireless channels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike the existing studies, in this paper, we consider a new HFL system with clients equipped with rechargeable batteries of finite capacity and relying on the renewable energy harvested from their environment to power local model training and uploading. The proposed TP-DDPG algorithm optimizes client scheduling and resource allocation (including bandwidth allocation, and the CPU frequencies and transmit powers of the clients) online during each round of edge aggregation, adapting to the time-varying system environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">We note that the convergence speed and stability of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm depend heavily on the sizes of its action spaces. The larger the action space is, the more difficulty the RL algorithm can have in converging. As a matter of fact, the convergence time could increase exponentially as the action space grows, if it indeed converges. In many other cases, such an RL algorithm may not converge or even diverge.
In light of this, the proposed TP-DDPG algorithm judiciously segments the action space of the problem at hand and interprets one part of the action space as part of the environment for the other part of the action space. As a consequence, the remaining action space that requires the attention of DDPG is substantially reduced, leading to enhanced convergence and reliability.
This can be critical to the efficiency and scalability of HFL systems, when the network is large with more clients involved.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since it was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, FL has received widespread attention for its capability of collaboratively training a shared ML model in a privacy-preserving manner. FL still faces challenges arising from practical implementation, including energy efficiency, communication efficiency, model accuracy, and the straggler effect <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. A number of existing works endeavored to address these challenges from different perspectives,
typically under the settings of edge- or cloud-based FL, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.

without leveraging battery (dis)charging. By optimizing simultaneous communication and computation resource allocation in NOMA and TDMA, Mo and Xu <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> minimized the total energy consumption at edge clients. For FL networks with CPU-GPU platforms, an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, allowing users to assign resources according to their individual needs. Considering heterogeneous computing and power resources, optimal resource allocation was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To improve model accuracy and alleviate the straggler effect, client scheduling strategies were investigated in energy- and/or latency-aware FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
None of these works integrated energy harvesting techniques for computation-intensive clients or considered a holistic optimization of client scheduling, bandwidth allocation, and the CPU frequencies and emission power of the clients. A heuristic greedy algorithm was suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> to choose the largest number of clients within a predefined timeframe for training.

The impact of different scheduling policies on the performance of FL was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Client scheduling strategies were also investigated considering packet errors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and imperfect channel state information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, respectively.</p>

A two-layer algorithm based on genetic algorithm and alternating optimization was proposed to minimize the
weighted sum of the optimality gap and overall latency in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. A
joint helper scheduling and wireless resource allocation scheme was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> to capture the importance of weighted gradient. Dynamic resource allocation was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, which however overlooked the energy consumption or latency of training.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed HFL framework works in a synchronous fashion, as it requires all edge servers to commence edge model aggregation only after receiving the local models from all its associated clients, and the cloud server to commence global model aggregation only after receiving the edge models from all edge servers. Synchronous FL has the advantage of ensuring that the global model is updated with the most recent information from the clients before aggregation, generally leading to fewer aggregation rounds and better convergence of the global training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. This helps avoid the stale model problem where slow clients may use outdated local models. Synchronous FL is suitable for network infrastructures synchronized, maintained, and operated closely by a network operator, such as the edge networks considered in this paper. The widely adopted network time protocol (NTP) can provide the required synchronization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Specifically, an epoch of local training could last for seconds or even minutes at individual clients. By contrast, the network synchronization protocols, such as NTP, synchronize network devices typically within milliseconds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. The required synchronization of model training and aggregation can be achieved by evaluating the processing speed of individual clients or edge servers, and selecting the slowest to specify the durations of aggregation rounds.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, distinctively different from synchronous FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and FL with so-called flexible aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, the aggregations in asynchronous FL start once an edge (or cloud) server receives a prespecified number of local (or edge) models, instead of all local (or edge) models. The formulation and resource allocation of asynchronous FL are substantially different from synchronous FL and beyond the scope of this paper.</p>

The convergence upper bound in (<a href="#S4.E17" title="In IV Problem Formulation ‣ Towards Dynamic Resource Allocation and Client Scheduling in Hierarchical Federated Learning: A Two-Phase Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>) is obtained by extending the analysis presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, Theorem 2]</cite>. In particular, persistent client association was considered throughout an HFL process in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, Theorem 2]</cite>.
In this paper, we extrapolate that analysis by considering the situation in which the clients may be associated with different edge servers at different edge aggregation rounds.</p>

Since the objective is to maximize the number of scheduled clients and minimize the learning delay of an HFL process, the system tends to select clients in good channel conditions. As a consequence, some clients remaining in poor channel conditions may never be selected. However, these clients may have datasets critical for the model accuracy, especially when heterogeneous data is considered among the clients.

First, obtaining the optimal solution to problem (<a href="#S4.E18" title="In IV Problem Formulation ‣ Towards Dynamic Resource Allocation and Client Scheduling in Hierarchical Federated Learning: A Two-Phase Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>) would require the perfect <span id="S4.p6.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a-priori</span> knowledge of the system (including channel conditions and energy arrival rates) throughout the HFL process, which is impossible in practice.

In this section, we delineate the new TP-DDPG framework to solve problem (<a href="#S4.E18" title="In IV Problem Formulation ‣ Towards Dynamic Resource Allocation and Client Scheduling in Hierarchical Federated Learning: A Two-Phase Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>) with a significantly improved convergence rate.
In the first phase, the selection of participating clients, transmit powers, and CPU configurations are decided by the DDPG for each edge aggregation round. In the second phase, the rest of problem (<a href="#S4.E18" title="In IV Problem Formulation ‣ Towards Dynamic Resource Allocation and Client Scheduling in Hierarchical Federated Learning: A Two-Phase Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>) is efficiently solved using the new SCABA, which is interpreted as part of the environment for the DDPG and produces rewards for the DDPG agent for model training.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the straggler effect in an edge aggregation round for the considered synchronous FL updates, we propose to use DDPG in the first phase of TP-DDPG to adaptively select clients preferably in good channel conditions in a round and avoid selecting straggling clients. Then, we propose the SCABA in the second phase to identify the
straggling edge server in each iteration, hence reducing its latency for edge aggregation. This is done by iteratively adjusting the association and bandwidth allocation strategy until the latency cannot be further shortened. In this way, the straggler effect in a global aggregation round can be significantly alleviated.</p>

optimal client association and bandwidth allocation decisions be updated, together with the delay and straggler; see Steps 10–13.
By switching out or swapping the clients associated with the straggling edge server to shorten the edge aggregation delay, the SCABA can converge to a stable and optimal client association and bandwidth allocation strategy within a limited number of iterations, where each edge server owns a stable set of associated clients to achieve the minimum edge aggregation delay. In other words, the delay cannot be further shortened by further adjusting the client association strategy.</p>

(No agent can be placed at an individual edge server, since the clients associated with a server can change dynamically.) After each client/agent obtains the client schedule, CPU frequency and transmission power, the edge servers decide the bandwidth allocation under the constraint of the total available bandwidth of an edge server.</p>

It is shown that as long as the number of selected clients remains the same, the proposed TP-DDPG algorithm always completes its FL task with the shortest latency.
The improvement of the TP-DDPG increases as the number of selected clients grows, compared with the NS, BEA, GA, and DDPG-Only algorithms. For instance, as the selected clients increase from five to ten, the additional delay required by the DDPG-Only increases from 6.3% to 53.3%, compared to the TP-DDPG algorithm. When all clients participate in each edge aggregation (i.e., the number of selected clients is 10), the RS is equivalent to the proposed TP-DDPG algorithm and produces the same delay.</p>

The proposed TP-DDPG algorithm converges to the largest utility within 2500 episodes. In other words, the algorithm can schedule more clients to join the FL task by adaptive client selection and association. In other words, better learning accuracy can be achieved within a shorter delay.

The test accuracy is the average of ten independent tests. We see that the proposed TP-DDPG always achieves the highest test accuracy. Given a predefined accuracy, the TP-DDPG significantly shortens the learning time. For instance, the TP-DDPG can save up to 39.4% of the learning time compared to the NS, when the required test accuracy is 0.9. This is because the TP-DDPG changes the resource allocation and client scheduling policy for different edge aggregations, creating a better opportunity to learn new samples from heterogeneous clients than the static NS.

Without constraining the maximum number of rounds for not selecting a user, Baseline 1 may keep selecting clients with good channel conditions. A client with a critical dataset but poor channel conditions may not be chosen. This renders poor FL accuracy.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The learning delay and model accuracy of an FL task in an HFL system with energy harvesting clients were balanced using a joint resource allocation and client scheduling problem. We developed a new TP-DDPG algorithm that optimizes online energy management, computation and communication resource allocation, and client scheduling, adapting to varying wireless channels and renewable energy sources. The algorithm learns the selection of participating clients, and the CPU configurations and transmission powers of the clients. The rest of the decisions, i.e., client association and bandwidth allocation, and the reward of the DDPG are efficiently optimized by the new SCABA algorithm.
Experimental results showed that the proposed TP-DDPG algorithm can achieve a higher test accuracy with a lower learning latency than the existing benchmarks.
