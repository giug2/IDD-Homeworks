<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising collaborative and secure paradigm for training a model from decentralized data without compromising privacy. <em id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Group fairness</em> and <em id="id7.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">client fairness</em> are two dimensions of fairness that are important for FL. Standard FL can result in disproportionate disadvantages for certain clients, and it still faces the challenge of treating different groups equitably in a population. The problem of privately training fair FL models without compromising the generalization capability of disadvantaged clients remains open. In this paper, we propose a method, called <span id="id7.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>, to address this problem and achieve group fairness and client fairness simultaneously. <span id="id7.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> leverages differential multipliers to construct an optimization objective for empirical risk minimization with fairness constraints. Before aggregating locally trained models, it first detects conflicts among their gradients, and then iteratively curates the direction and magnitude of gradients to mitigate these conflicts. Theoretical analysis proves <span id="id7.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> facilitates the fairness in model development. The experimental evaluations based on three benchmark datasets show significant advantages of <span id="id7.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Introduction</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The widespread adoption of machine learning models has given rise to significant apprehensions regarding fairness, spurring the emergence of fairness criteria and models. In recent times, a multitude of fairness criteria have been put forth, with one of the most widely acknowledged ones being <span id="Sx1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">group fairness</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hardt, Price, and Srebro <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Ustun, Liu, and Parkes <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Group fairness might also be mandated by legal statutes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(EU et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, necessitating models to impartially treat distinct groups concerning sensitive attributes such as age, gender, and race.
Building upon these concepts of group fairness, numerous methodologies have been introduced to train equitable models, predicated on the premise that the model can directly access the complete training dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zafar et al. <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Roh et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, the ownership of these datasets often resides with disparate institutions, rendering them inaccessible for sharing due to privacy safeguarding considerations.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>)</cite> stands as a distributed learning paradigm that facilitates the collective training of a model by multiple data custodians, all while retaining their data within their local domains. If each data steward was to individually train a fairness model on their own data and subsequently contribute it for aggregation, akin to the methods of FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> and FedOPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Reddi et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, a promising avenue emerges for augmenting model fairness within decentralized contexts. However, the presence of data heterogeneity, manifesting in variations in sizes and distributions across different clients, introduces a distortion to the localized efforts aimed at enhancing fairness in the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, a disparity emerges between the impartial model aggregated in a straightforward manner, utilizing fairness models trained on diverse client datasets, and the model achieved under centralized circumstances.
Meanwhile, a simplistic pursuit of minimizing the aggregation loss in the federated system can lead the global model astray, favoring certain clients excessively and disadvantaging others, thereby engendering what is termed as <em id="Sx1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">client fairness</em>. Preceding endeavors have predominantly centered on rectifying issues concerning client fairness. These efforts encompass methodologies such as re-weighting client aggregation weights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhao and Joshi <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, tackling distributed mini-max optimization challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mohri, Sivek, and Suresh <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, or mitigating conflicts between clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hu et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, our emphasis pivots toward multi-dimensional fairness, encompassing both group and client fairness, aligning with legal stipulations and ethical considerations. This dual focus also significantly influences the willingness of clients to actively engage in the FL process, thereby contributing to datasets that are more comprehensive and representative for the training of the global model.
However, the inherent decentralized nature of this approach engenders complexities in achieving equitable training for a global model, particularly when confronted with the intricate tapestry of heterogeneous data distributions spanning the client landscape. The intricate challenge of privately training an equitable model from such decentralized, disparate data, while ensuring equitable treatment for each contributing client, poses a formidable conundrum. We aim to address this open and intricate quandary.</p>

<br class="ltx_break">(iii) Through both theoretical and experimental analysis, we demonstrate that <span id="Sx1.p5.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> excels in mitigating gradient conflicts among clients, ultimately achieving a higher degree of group fairness compared to the state of the art (SOTA).</p>

<div id="Sx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the growing concern surrounding fairness, various approaches have been proposed. To analyze the problem, we categorize fairness models into two types: centralized and federated, based on their training protocols.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fairness models on centralized data.</span>
In the context of centralized data, it is common to modify the training framework to attain an appropriate level of group fairness, ensuring that a classifier exhibits comparable performance across different sensitive groups. Several techniques have been devised to address group fairness issues within the centralized setting, which can be categorized into three types: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing methods.
Pre-processing methods act before model training, aiming to eliminate implicit discrimination from datasets. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Feldman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> made adjustments to sensitive attribute values in the dataset to achieve similar distributions among different sensitive groups. In-processing methods integrate fairness constraints directly into the model training process. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Garg et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> added penalties to the loss function to minimize differences between real samples and their counterfactual counterparts. Post-processing methods focus on fairness through adjustments to the model’s output. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Mishler, Kennedy, and Chouldechova (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> employed double-robust estimators to reconstruct a trained model, aiming for approximate counterfactual fairness. Among these methods, in-processing techniques are often more effective in achieving a balance between model accuracy and fairness.
The proposed <span id="Sx2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> is an in-processing fairness solution tailored for FL.
For more extensive insights into fairness methods applied to centralized data, refer to the recent literature survey <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pessach and Shmueli <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="Sx2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fairness FL models on decentralized data.</span>
In contrast, achieving fairness within the practical FL setting has received limited attention compared to centralized solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>. The notion of ‘fairness’ in FL differs slightly from the standard concept in centralized learning. <em id="Sx2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Client fairness</em>, a popular fairness definition in FL, aims to ensure that all clients (i.e., data owners) achieve similar accuracy. Previous attempts to achieve client fairness in FL include modifying the aggregation weights of clients to achieve a uniform service quality for all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>; Zhao and Joshi <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, and combining minimax optimization and gradient normalization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hu et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Yue, Nouiehed, and Al Kontar (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> penalized the difference in aggregated loss to enforce consistent performance across participating clients. These fair FL solutions exclusively target client fairness. Only a few studies are dedicated to group fairness in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abay et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Du et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gálvez et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> distributively optimized local objective with fairness metric and then aggregated them to address fairness. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Zeng, Chen, and Lee (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> updated the weight of local loss for each sensitive group during the global aggregation phase. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ezzeldin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> adapted client weights based on local fairness of each client and deviations from global one. However, these methods disregard the gradient conflicts, which lead to performance decline and unfavourable outcomes for certain clients.</p>

The proof is deferred into the Supplementary file.

Nonetheless, when the centralized data are heterogeneous in terms of size and distribution across clients, adopting fairness-enhancing techniques in standard FL remains challenging, as it limits fairness improvement at the global level. In the next section, we introduce how <span id="Sx3.SSx3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> alleviates client conflicts and trains a fair global model to bridge this gap.</p>

<div id="Sx4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Theorem 1 demonstrates the potency of FL in effectively bolstering model fairness while safeguarding against data leakage within a decentralized context. Nevertheless, employing fairness methods directly within the FL framework might not be the optimal approach. This challenge arises from the significant heterogeneity in data distributions across clients. Consequently, the localized fairness performance could diverge from fairness across the entire population. Additionally, in this scenario, the concept of client fairness gains prominence as another critical facet of fairness that necessitates consideration.</p>

<p id="Sx4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle these intricacies, we introduce <span id="Sx4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>, a solution designed to confidentially train a global model while integrating group fairness.

<span id="Sx4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> strategically transforms the fairness-constrained problem into an unconstrained problem that enforces fairness through the use of Lagrange multipliers. In each communication round, every client computes its training loss, measures of fairness violations, and gradients. Subsequently, these statistics are communicated to the FL server (aggregation phase). The server then identifies and rectifies conflicting gradients’ direction and magnitude before aggregation. This refined model is then updated and distributed to clients (local training phase). This intricate process enables <span id="Sx4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> to attain a precise global model that remains equitable for both sensitive groups and individual clients.

<div id="Sx4.SSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">During the aggregation phase, the server leverages the information provided by clients to refine and update the global model. Owing to the presence of diverse data distributions, gradient conflicts emerge among clients. In isolation, these conflicts might not be inherently detrimental, as straightforward gradient averaging can effectively optimize the global objective function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. However, when conflicts among gradients involve considerable variations in magnitudes, certain clients could encounter pronounced drops in performance.
For instance, consider the scenario of training a binary classifier. If a subset of clients holds a majority of data pertaining to one class, and conflicts in gradients arise between these two classes, the global model could become skewed toward the majority-class clients, thereby compromising performance on the other class. Moreover, even when class balance is maintained among clients, disparities in gradient magnitudes may persist due to divergent sample sizes across clients.</p>

Throughout our experiments, we adhere to a uniform protocol of 10 communication rounds and 20 local epochs for all FL algorithms. For other methods, we execute 200 epochs, leveraging cross-validation techniques on the training sets to determine optimal hyperparameters for the comparative methods. All algorithms are grounded in ReLU neural networks with four hidden layers, thereby ensuring an equal count of model parameters.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Further elaboration on the selection of hyperparameters for <span id="footnote2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> can be found in the Supplementary file.</span></span></span> We use the same server (Ubuntu 18.04.5, Intel Xeon Gold 6248R and Nvidia RTX 3090) to perform experiments.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Estimation on Group fairness</h3>

<div id="Sx5.SSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.SSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We undertake a comprehensive comparative analysis, focusing on the accuracy and group fairness aspects of the evaluated methods. To delve into the intricate relationship between method performance and data heterogeneity, we adopt a random assignment strategy. Specifically, we randomly assign 30%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 10% of the samples from group 0 and 10%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 30% of the samples from group 1 to five clients, respectively. The outcomes of this data splitting strategy, encompassing average accuracy along with standard deviations and the Demographic Parity violation score for each method, are outlined in Table S2. Furthermore, for datasets characterized by pronounced data heterogeneity, we draw samples from each group across five clients at a ratio of 50%, 10%, 10%, 20%, 10%, and 10%, 40%, 30%, 10%, 10%, respectively. The corresponding experimental outcomes are showcased in Table <a href="#A2.T2" title="Table S2 ‣ Estimation on Client Fairness ‣ Appendix S2 Experiments ‣ Multi-dimensional Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">S2</span></a>.
From the insights gleaned from Tables S2 and <a href="#A2.T2" title="Table S2 ‣ Estimation on Client Fairness ‣ Appendix S2 Experiments ‣ Multi-dimensional Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">S2</span></a>, we observe that:
<br class="ltx_break">(i) <span id="Sx5.SSx2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> prominently enhances fairness, achieving a parity of fairness akin to CenFair. This substantiates <span id="Sx5.SSx2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>’s efficacy in skillfully training fair models for sensitive groups within the decentralized data landscape.
<br class="ltx_break">(ii) The lackluster performance of IndFair in terms of group fairness accentuates that in a decentralized scenario, fairness models exclusively trained on local data fall considerably short of achieving group fairness at a population-wide level. It is also noteworthy that FedAvg-f occasionally exhibits lower accuracy than IndFair. This discrepancy arises from the aggregation strategy of FedAvg-f, which can have unintended consequences for certain clients, causing the averaged local fair models to not be equitable for any sub-distribution. Conversely, IndFair manages to ensure fairness for specific sub-distributions through the training of each local model.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.SSx2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="Sx5.SSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">(iii) In direct comparison, <span id="Sx5.SSx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> distinctly outperforms FedAvg-f in both accuracy and fairness, thus underscoring the constraints inherent in merely grafting fairness techniques onto the FL paradigm. Evidently, the group fairness achieved by FedAvg-f lags behind the fairness exhibited across the entire population. This gap is particularly pronounced in scenarios characterized by high data heterogeneity among clients. Through the judicious amalgamation of fairness techniques with the decentralized essence of FL, and its steadfast commitment to ensuring advantageous model updates for all clients, <span id="Sx5.SSx2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> adeptly enhances both the overarching fairness and accuracy, thereby offering a comprehensive improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.SSx2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="Sx5.SSx2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">(iv) Notably, <span id="Sx5.SSx2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> can better trade-off accuracy and group fairness than FedFB, FPFL and FairFed. This is because they overlook the detrimental effects of the conflicting gradients with large difference in the magnitudes, leading to accuracy reduction and harming certain clients. FedMGDA+ frequently yields the highest accuracy in various scenarios, but markedly infringes upon the fairness of model decisions as applied to disadvantaged groups. This is primarily attributed to the fact that FedMGDA+ concentrate solely on aligning client accuracy without due regard for mitigating discrimination against sensitive groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx5.SSx2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="Sx5.SSx2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">(v) Upon juxtaposing the outcomes presented in Table <a href="#A2.T2" title="Table S2 ‣ Estimation on Client Fairness ‣ Appendix S2 Experiments ‣ Multi-dimensional Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">S2</span></a> (high heterogeneity) with those in Table S2 (low heterogeneity), a salient observation arises: <span id="Sx5.SSx2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> demonstrates a marginal decrease in both fairness and accuracy when transitioning from low to high data heterogeneity. This underscores the robustness intrinsic to <span id="Sx5.SSx2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> when grappling with heterogeneous data. Such a consistency aligns with our initial expectations, as <span id="Sx5.SSx2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> adeptly orchestrates gradient directions and magnitudes to navigate conflicts, thereby ensuring equitable model updates across all clients. Conversely, FedAvg-f manifests notable performance disparities across distinct data heterogeneity levels, with a particularly steep decline observed in scenarios characterized by high data heterogeneity. This vulnerability is attributed to FedAvg-f’s simplistic gradient averaging approach, which insufficiently accommodates the intricate impact of data heterogeneity on the global model.</p>

<p id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The group fairness-aware model cultivated by <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> brings about advantages for each participating client, all while avoiding any undue preference towards specific clients. To further validate this assertion, we embark on a series of experiments designed to evaluate <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>’s performance in terms of <em id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Client Fairness</em>, subsequently juxtaposing it against other pertinent fairness methods. <em id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Client Fairness</em> stands as a potent metric for gauging whether the global model disproportionately favors particular clients while disregarding the rest. To further accentuate the discerning capabilities of <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>, we undertake the random allocation of samples: 50% and 10% of group 0 samples, coupled with 10%, 20%, and 10% of group 1 samples, are assigned to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th clients, respectively. This deliberate strategy accentuates pronounced data heterogeneity across clients. For reference, FedAvg constitutes the baseline in this experimental setup. The resulting accuracy and violation scores pertinent to <em id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Client Fairness</em> for each method are succinctly presented in Table <a href="#A2.T3" title="Table S3 ‣ Estimation on Client Fairness ‣ Appendix S2 Experiments ‣ Multi-dimensional Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">S3</span></a>. Our observations from this comparative analysis are as follows:
<br class="ltx_break">(i) Remarkably, <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> emerges as the frontrunner, boasting the most modest client fairness violation scores while achieving accuracy on par with other fairness-focused FL methods. In essence, <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> excels in abating the potential biases inherent to FL contexts. Through its meticulous consideration of conflicting gradients and adept adjustments to their directions and magnitudes, <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> guarantees a more equitable distribution of model updates among clients. This concerted effort tangibly diminishes the breach of client fairness, ultimately heralding a more even allocation of model updates among all participating clients.
In contrast, both q-FFL and DRFL endeavor to tackle client fairness by manipulating client aggregation weights, but falter in effectively addressing conflicts characterized by substantial gradient magnitude disparities. Ditto aims to strike a balance between local and global models, engendering personalized models for individual clients. However, its global model aggregation strategy closely resembles that of FedAvg, potentially yielding unfavorable outcomes for certain clients. In the same vein, FedMDGA+ aspires to pinpoint a shared update direction for all clients during federated training, inadvertently overlooking the influential role played by gradient magnitudes in model aggregation. Therefore, it is evident that <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> stands as the epitome of achievement, outperforming its counterparts both in terms of client fairness and accuracy.
<br class="ltx_break">(ii) FedAvg, unfortunately, languishes at the bottom of the performance spectrum, marked by inferior accuracy and client fairness. This regression is traceable to its rudimentary averaging strategy, which disregards the disparate contributions of individual clients. Consequently, when confronting gradients in conflict with significantly divergent magnitudes, FedAvg becomes susceptible to overfitting certain clients at the detriment of others. The significant difference in performance between <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> and FedAvg demonstrates the potency of <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> in counteracting client conflicts.
<br class="ltx_break">(iii) To further solidify <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>’s efficacy, we furnish the number of iterations imperative for all compared methods to attain their optimal performance in Figure S1 of the Supplementary file. This visual depiction affords insights into the convergence trajectories undertaken by distinct methods over iterations. Notably, <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> exhibits commendable performance levels and converges towards the pinnacle of client fairness within a noticeably fewer (or comparable) count of communication rounds. This clearly underscores <span id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1.15" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>’s capacity to efficiently train the model, attaining the desired accuracy and client fairness benchmarks with commendable efficacy.</p>

<p id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To prove the necessity of the projection order of <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>, we introduce two variants of <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>: (i) <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>-rnd adjusts the gradients in a random order of the projection target. (ii) <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>-rev adjusts gradients in the opposite order. The experimental settings are the same as the previous subsection. The results are shown in Table <a href="#Sx5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Ablation Study ‣ Experimental Evaluation ‣ Multi-dimensional Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
In can be observed that the projection order has significant impact on the effectiveness of gradient projection. <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>-rnd ignores the information provided by client losses. Thus, it loses to <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> in terms of <em id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">group fairness</em> and <em id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">client fairness</em>. <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>-rev achieves lower fairness than <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>-rnd, indicating that the global model tends to neglecting clients with poorer performance when adjusting gradients in the opposite order of <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>. The best multi-dimensional fairness performance is obtained by <span id="Sx5.SSx4.p1.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span>. This confirms that its loss-based order helps improve fairness.</p>

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Addressing both group fairness and client fairness is paramount when considering fairness issues in the realm of FL. This paper introduces the novel <span id="Sx6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> method as a groundbreaking solution that adeptly navigates these dual dimensions of fairness. <span id="Sx6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> formulates the optimization conundrum as a minimax problem featuring group fairness constraints. Through meticulous adjustments to conflicting gradients throughout the training regimen, <span id="Sx6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> orchestrates model updates that distinctly benefit all clients in an equitable manner.
Both theoretical study and empirical results confirm that mitigating client conflicts during global model update improves the fairness for sensitive groups, and <span id="Sx6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> effectively achieves both group fairness and client fairness.</p>

We also draw samples from each group across five clients at a ratio of 50%, 10%, 10%, 20%, 10%, and 10%, 40%, 30%, 10%, 10%, respectively, to simulates high data heterogeneity among the clients. The corresponding experimental results are shown in Table <a href="#A2.T3" title="Table S3 ‣ Estimation on Client Fairness ‣ Appendix S2 Experiments ‣ Multi-dimensional Fair Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">S3</span></a>. Our observations from this comparative analysis are as follows: 
<br class="ltx_break">(i) As expected, <span id="A2.SSx4.p1.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> significantly improves fairness, achieving a similar level of fairness as CenFL. This not only validates the effectiveness of <span id="A2.SSx4.p1.6.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> in adeptly training fair models for sensitive groups in decentralized settings, but also demonstrates its adaptability to more realistic scenarios involving multiple sensitive attributes and values. 
<br class="ltx_break">(ii) The underperformance of IndFair in terms of group fairness highlights that training fair models exclusively on local data in decentralized settings with high data heterogeneity falls far short of achieving group fairness at a population level. Besides, the group fairness achieved by FedAvg-f lags behind the fairness demonstrated across the entire population. Moreover, it faces another dimension of fairness issue where the trained global model exhibits bias towards certain clients. These facts highlight the inherent limitations of merely transplanting fairness techniques onto FL. 
<br class="ltx_break">(iii) <span id="A2.SSx4.p1.6.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> demonstrates a superior ability to strike a balance between multi-dimensional fairness, in term of both group fairness and client fairness, and accuracy in scenarios involving multiple sensitive attributes with multiple domain values, surpassing FedFB, FPFL, FairFed, and FedMGDA+. This is because the compared methods either solely focus on group fairness or solely concentrate on client fairness during the global model training. Moreover, they neglect the negative impacts of conflicting gradients with large differences in the magnitudes, resulting in a degradation in the model performance. In contrast, <span id="A2.SSx4.p1.6.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">mFairFL</span> emphasizes multi-dimensional fairness during model training, and before aggregating the local models, it carefully examines the presence of conflicting gradients. It then adjusts the magnitude and direction of conflicting gradients to mitigate the adverse effects of such conflicts.</p>
