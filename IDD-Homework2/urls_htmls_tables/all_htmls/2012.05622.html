<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Distributed learning algorithms aim to leverage distributed and diverse data stored at users’ devices to learn a global phenomena by performing training amongst participating devices and periodically aggregating their local models’ parameters into a global model. Federated learning is a promising paradigm that allows for extending local training among the participant devices before aggregating the parameters, offering better communication efficiency. However, in the cases where the participants’ data are strongly skewed (i.e., non-IID), the local models can overfit local data, leading to low performing global model. In this paper, we first show that a major cause of the performance drop is the weighted distance between the distribution over classes on users’ devices and the global distribution. Then, to face this challenge, we leverage the edge computing paradigm to design a hierarchical learning system that performs Federated Gradient Descent on the user-edge layer and Federated Averaging on the edge-cloud layer. In this hierarchical architecture, we formalize and optimize this user-edge assignment problem such that edge-level data distributions turn to be similar (i.e., close to IID), which enhances the Federated Averaging performance. Our experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed optimized assignment is tractable and leads to faster convergence of models towards a better accuracy value.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the increasing trend towards learning-assisted applications, the realization of these applications on end-user devices and data still poses significant challenges. Such challenges include the communication overhead required to move data to learning servers, in addition to privacy concerns associated with such movement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Motivated by these challenges, local data storage and processing with global coordination is envisioned to be a promising approach in the future of computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Learning</em> (FL) is a manifestation of this approach that aims to enable end devices to learn highly-performing models without outsourcing their data or requiring high computational power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In FL, end devices execute parts of the learning algorithms on their local data, reaching a local model. The local models are then sent and synchronized (aggregated) in a cloud server, before being sent back to local devices. This process repeats until models converge, and contains multiple parameters, such as the number of local steps and the synchronization algorithm, which are usually tuned to maintain data privacy, avoid communication overhead, and reach overall higher accuracy models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The paradigm of processing massive data generated by end devices is formalized in the networking community through the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Edge Computing</em> (EC) architectures, where edge nodes such as home gateways, small-cells, or micro servers are equipped with storage and computation capabilities. Edge nodes communicate efficiently with end-user equipments (UEs), and they work with the remote cloud to perform large-scale distributed tasks that involve both local processing and remote coordination/execution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. While EC is a general-purpose architecture that enables a form of hierarchical multi-layer processing, it can be used for learning tasks, leading to the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In HFL, each UE performs local learning tasks leveraging its own dataset. The learned models are then periodically synchronized through an edge node, reaching an edge-level model. In turn, the edge nodes also periodically synchronize their models with the cloud server to reach the global model (i.e., cloud-level model).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In FL and HFL settings, the most widely used model synchronization algorithm is FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. FedAvg uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the learning algorithm. Hence, each UE performs several steps of SGD on its own data locally. Then, the local models are synchronized through calculating the average of model parameters, weighted by the size of their datasets. FedAvg proved effective in multiple learning scenarios, and in fact, is already used in production <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, its performance degrades severely when the local datasets are highly imbalanced (i.e., skewed samples in each group of UEs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. This is because gradient-based algorithms operate on the main assumption that data is independent and identically distributed (widely known as the i.i.d assumption). This assumption is violated in FL settings since each end device usually contains/generates skewed data depending on its task, specification, and characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Formally, the <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">distribution over classes</em> differs significantly from a UE to another. Thus, each local dataset is often not a good representative of the global population and is a highly biased estimator of that population. In HFL, this challenge transfers to two levels: the distribution difference between UEs’ datasets allocated to an edge node, and the distribution difference between the edge nodes’ themselves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There is limited room for improvement in solving the imbalance issue in the regular FL settings due to the inability to modify or share (parts of) users’ data among themselves in order to reduce the distribution difference between users. However, such restrictions can be worked-around in the HFL settings; In many cases, UEs have access to more than one edge server; this is mainly due to network densification and the increased mobility of user devices. Such flexibility provides us with a vital control knob that we can leverage, which is deciding UE-edge assignments in such a way that minimizes the distribution difference between edge nodes (i.e., balances data under each edge). Such a network control problem is inline with the Reconfigurable Wireless Networks (RWNs) paradigm, which enables networks software, hardware, or protocols to be reconfigured to maximize a specific utility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. For example, the optimization of edge-user assignments can be realized through reconfiguring routes for nodes’ traffic to go through specific edges, ensuring balanced edge-level datasets for faster and more accurate learning. The formulation, and solution attempts, of edge-user assignment problem for data balancing are of utmost importance for the era of edge computing and learning-assisted applications.</p>

As these parameters are shown to be mainly due to user-edge assignment, we optimize this assignment to enhance the distributed learning performance of UEs.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Federated Learning paradigm includes multiple sub-problems that are being actively investigated in the literature. For instance, Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> focused on optimizing the global synchronization (aggregation) frequency based on the resources of the learning devices. Secure synchronization techniques are explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, where cryptographic multi-party computation is used to limit the server’s ability to infer users’ data from the models. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed methods to select only a subset of users for the synchronization process and demonstrated the advantages of such techniques on the learning speed and performance, especially in the presence of resource-constrained nodes. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> formulated a multi-objective optimization of minimizing energy cost and learning time for wireless devices given a target model accuracy, and possibly heterogeneous computational and communication capabilities. However, the aforementioned studies do not directly propose methods to alleviate the effects of non-i.i.d data. Thus they are orthogonal to our work in this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Some works identified and primarily addressed the non-i.i.d issue in FL. For example, Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> determined, theoretically and empirically, the effect of local data skewness on the global learning model. Since exchanging data between users is not possible, the authors proposed to use a central proxy iid dataset, which is distributed over clients. Mixing this data with the local user’s data will make it less biased and potentially a better estimator of the overall dataset. Although the experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of this proxy dataset, obtaining such a dataset is not always feasible. Furthermore, the communication overhead of downloading parts of this data to each user is a considerable disadvantage. This line of work was improved upon by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where the authors avoided needing proxy data through carefully selecting users participating in each synchronization round. The selection process is done through inferring the distribution over labels at each user’s dataset, and then selecting a group of clients that are as diverse as possible, which results in a better learning performance due to the better quality data samples. Alternatively, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> focused on the aggregation technique itself. The authors proposed to replace the averaging with a compression-based aggregation, which alleviates the weights divergence effects that would otherwise be more pronounced in the averaging. These studies have shown the effect of data distribution on the obtained performance. However, they neither consider the communication overhead nor the HFL architecture and its associated user-edge assignment problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are few studies that jointly consider HFL for non-iid data. A notable example is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In this paper, the authors extended the results of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and generalized it to HFL. They analytically linked learning performances (as modeled by the gap between the federated model and centralized virtual model) with both: the client-edge distribution difference and the edge-cloud distribution difference. This line of work was further improved in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> with enhanced probabilistic client selection that is set to avoid failed/slow devices and their potential impact on the learning process (e.g., halting). While Important insights about user selection/grouping were obtained from the theoretical analysis of these studies, an optimization formalism was not provided. In contrast, the client selection proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> considered the distribution distance as a part of an optimization problem. However, the distance is optimized through adjusting the local batch size, which might lead to the underutilization of data in strongly skewed users. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. A hierarchical architecture that includes mediators, which can be considered as edge nodes, is proposed. Also, an assignment scheme that aims to minimize the KL divergence (a distribution distance measure) of edges distributions is utilized. Our work differs in that the used measure for distribution distance is the absolute value of the distribution difference (also known as Earth Moving Distance) since it is the one that shows in the theoretical analysis. The authors did explicitly consider the mediator-client assignment constraints as mediators were assumed to always be available. Lastly, sequential gradient descent was proposed in the user-mediator layer, which necessitates a potentially expensive data augmentation to balance individual user’s contributions to the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, formulating and optimizing UEs’ assignment to edge servers for hierarchical federated learning based on both statistical properties of local datasets, and communication constraints have not been addressed in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Different from distributed optimization on mobile devices, distributed optimization is also done on servers at data centers. It was demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> that synchronous distributed gradient descent algorithms for distributed optimization (also referred to as FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>) delivers identical performance to an SGD optimization done on a virtually aggregated local datasets. FedSGD is a gradient-based algorithm equivalent to federated learning when the global aggregation occurs at every step, and every local step is a full deterministic gradient. FedSGD is robust to non-iid data distribution. However, this comes at the cost of more communications rounds since aggregation is done after each local gradient step. Thus, more communication rounds are needed. Nonetheless, as indicated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, synchronous distributed gradient descent can be exploited whenever the communication links allow (e.g., in data centers).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we design an optimized hierarchical learning system considering both the statistical properties of local datasets and wireless communication connectivity. Our work focuses on the scenario where edge nodes are close to UEs and thus have low communication cost and delay. Hence, we adopt FedSGD in the UE-Edge layer. On the other hand, edge-cloud communication is delay-prone. Therefore, we adopt FedAvg, which performs a higher number of local steps before the cloud aggregation. In this context, we optimize the UE-edge assignment in order to minimize the communication rounds between edge nodes and the cloud. The overall objective of our optimization problem is to achieve high accuracy with the minimum delay as majorly influenced by the edge cloud communication rounds.</p>

To tackle this problem, we propose two solution approaches. The first solution is based on transforming the formulated problem into a linear integer program. While this transformation does not solve the NP-Hardness of the problem, it enables us to utilize several known approximations that are only feasible in the linear case. The second approach is an equalization heuristic, which is based on the observation that it provides an optimal solution in a particular case, as will be seen in the next section.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section presents the proposed two approaches for solving our optimization problem that aims to minimize the distribution difference between edge nodes and the global one given a set of connectivity constraints. The optimization is performed by the cloud server, and the resulting solution, i.e., the edge-user assignments, are communicated by the servers to the user devices so that they determine their edge node prior to starting the training. Note that it is possible that while the training is being executed, a change in the system occurs. For example, a new edge node joins, or a new NTC arises. In such a case, the optimization can be done again, depending on the change’s expected effect. The recurrence of the optimization can be determined based on the complexity of the learning problem as it influences the learning duration.</p>

This is due to the program’s linearity, which enables solution heuristics, such as relaxing the integrality and rounding the solutions (stochastic, or deterministic rounding), or solving the problem directly through Branch and Bound search but with improved bounding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. If the latter is used, then the bounding is done through leveraging the continuous version of the linear program, which can be solved easily, to calculate the lower bound of each node, enhancing the search process compared to the regular Branch and Bound algorithm. These linear programming techniques are readily available in most of the current solvers.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It can be seen that the random assignment already achieves a low total distribution distance. This is expected since users’ uniform assignment will assign each edge with different users having samples from each class, resulting in an i.i.d data allocation. The proposed optimized approach still offers a lower value. This better performance is mainly because the randomization does not take into account the classes’ distribution within each user and might allocate a user to any edge. However, the optimization search considers imbalances and allocates users in a way that is not necessarily uniform but guaranteed to have better probability distances (e.g., assigning users with an imbalanced and high number of samples of a specific class to edges with a deficit in that class). The proposed heuristic approach is an approximation of the optimization that delivers close performance. While it does not perform the expensive search, it greedily attempts equalization, aiming to provide each edge with all classes instances. This performs better than the random assignment (i.e., baseline). It is also identical to the optimal solution in cases where the classes are balanced, and the groups are divisible on the edges (as illustrated in Lemma 3). In the general case, however, such assignments obtain a performance close to the optimal solution.</p>

On the other hand, the original assignment model is slower to reach any specific accuracy and converges on a lower accuracy value. This is in line with what is found in the literature and is mainly due to the initial weight divergence and the overfitting of each edge to its local skewed distributions. The difference in the accuracy is most pronounced in the CIFAR dataset. CIFAR is known to be a more challenging classification problem compared to the other two, which explains the wider performance gap. Note that these accuracies do not represent the state-of-the-art. However, our focus in this paper is on the divergence between the federated models and their centralized version rather than achieving the most accurate centralized model. Hence, the neural architectures described earlier are sufficient for our purposes.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed optimization focused on the edge-cloud communication round minimization as it is the main delay cause in HFL architecture. The edge-client network was assumed to provide a negligible communication delay. Thus, we did not consider the user-edge communication round. However, In some cases, the user-edge communication can contribute considerably to the delay, which requires federated learning, with extended local computation, also on the user-edge layer. In such a case, a conflicting dual-objective optimization arises: Assigning heterogeneous users to an edge will increase the user-edge distribution distance, but it will decrease the edge-cloud distribution distance since each edge is likely to contain all classes. Conversely, assigning similar users’ to an edge will decrease the user-edge distribution distance, and increase the edge-cloud one. The solution to this dual-objective optimization is an entire Pareto front, of which a certain point is considered optimal after determining the weight of each of the objectives (weight for the user-edge distribution distance minimization objective, and another for the edge cloud distribution distance minimization objective). This weight can be determined depending on multiple factors, such as the delay caused by each layer’s topology and the energy constraints in each layer for user devices. The problem introduced in this paper can be considered as an instance of this dual-objective with no weight on the user-edge divergence. Interested readers may consider the concurrent works in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which proposes P2P communication at the users’ layer, and the convergence analysis in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> which studies the convergence rate of HFL considering FedAvg at both layers. In facts, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> also suggests that careful “grouping” strategies of UEs may enhance HFL performance, which is the subject of this paper.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied the hierarchical federated learning paradigm, which leverages edge servers to synchronize users’ models, and a cloud server to synchronize edges’ models. The objective is to obtain accurate models with minimum edge-cloud communication rounds as they are the dominant source of delay in these systems. Toward this end, we first derived an expression for the upper bound of deviation of the federated model from the centralized one, which was shown to be proportional to the weighted distance between each node’s distribution and the global one. Guided by this insight, we formalized an optimization problem that assigns users to edge nodes in their communication range to minimize the distribution distance between edge devices. However, the formulated problem is turned to be an NP-Hard problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We then proposed two approaches to solve our problem. The first is a branch and bound-based solution to a simplified linear version of the problem that assumes equal assignments between edges. The second is a heuristic-based approach that greedily attempts to equalize class distributions among edge devices. Under certain conditions, we demonstrated that the two solution approaches yield the same optimal assignments. In the general case, both yield close sub-optimal solutions. We then tested the heuristic solution using three public datasets with results showing significant performance improvement when considering the users are in proximity of only two edge nodes. Eventually, we argue that both the communication properties of user devices and the statistical properties of their datasets should be considered in the design of future distributed and mobile learning systems. To that end, promising future research can look at online algorithms to select participating clients based on their communication channels and quality of data as well as advanced aggregation algorithms (other than FedAvg) that are inherently robust to non-IID data (e.g., weighting based on factors other than the dataset size).</p>
