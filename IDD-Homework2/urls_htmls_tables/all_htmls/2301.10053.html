<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent advances in synthetic data generation (SDG) have been hailed as a solution to the difficult problem of sharing sensitive data while protecting privacy. SDG aims to learn statistical properties of real data in order to generate “artificial” data that are structurally and statistically similar to sensitive data. However, prior research suggests that inference attacks on synthetic data can undermine privacy, but only for specific outlier records.</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduce a new attribute inference attack against synthetic data. The attack is based on linear reconstruction methods for aggregate statistics, which target all records in the dataset, not only outliers. We evaluate our attack on state-of-the-art SDG algorithms, including Probabilistic Graphical Models, Generative Adversarial Networks, and recent differentially private SDG mechanisms. By defining a formal privacy game, we show that our attack can be highly accurate even on arbitrary records, and that this is the result of individual information leakage (as opposed to population-level inference).</p>
<p id="id3.id3" class="ltx_p">We then systematically evaluate the tradeoff between protecting privacy and preserving statistical utility. Our findings suggest that current SDG methods cannot consistently provide sufficient privacy protection against inference attacks while retaining reasonable utility. The best method evaluated, a differentially private SDG mechanism, can provide both protection against inference attacks and reasonable utility, but only in very specific settings. Lastly, we show that releasing a larger number of synthetic records can improve utility but at the cost of making attacks far more effective.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Modern scientific research benefits from large datasets of personal data, facilitated by data sharing between organizations. In the past decade, data breaches, privacy threats, and lost public trust have challenged access to data, putting reproducibility and open data efforts at risk. Data anonymization—the process of sanitizing data so that individuals are no longer identifiable—is one of the main ways to share data while minimizing privacy risks for data subjects. However, a large body of research has shown that traditional anonymization techniques are generally inadequate and do not provide a good tradeoff between privacy and statistical utility for modern data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a potential solution to provide both high utility and privacy protection. This approach relies on algorithms that learn the underlying distribution of the data, to then generate structurally and statistically similar data. The resulting synthetic data may not contain any original record, yet can be seamlessly integrated into analysis pipelines at little to no cost. One of the main use cases of synthetic data is in tabular data publishing, with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) suggesting that synthetic data can “serve as a practical replacement of the original sensitive data” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. The UK Royal Society further argued that it “retain(s) the statistical properties of the original dataset” such that “the anonymity of the original dataset is not compromised” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite these positive early evaluations, the fact that synthetic records are “artificial” does not, per se, guarantee that the privacy of all individuals in the original dataset are protected. In the past few years, the privacy guarantees provided by generative models and synthetic data have come under heightened scrutiny <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. For instance, having full access to the internal parameters of the trained generative model allows adversaries to run powerful attacks against high-dimensional synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, this adversarial model, referred to as the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">white-box</span> setting, is often unrealistic as the trained model is typically not shared in the context of synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">black-box</span> setting, where the adversary has exact knowledge on the specifications of the SDG algorithm along with some auxiliary knowledge, Stadler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> propose a membership inference attack (with an adversary attempting to predict presence in the training dataset), adapting the shadow modelling technique from Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>. They show that information leakage can in fact be exploited without directly relying on overt memorization by the generative model, but only for specific outlier records.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the most restrictive scenario where the adversary has no knowledge of the SDG algorithm (<span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">no-box</span> setting), while prior work has proposed attacks, they have limited effectiveness in practice. Against generative models that memorize and output training data, Chen et al. suggested a simple heuristic attack—searching for the closest synthetic record to a victim’s record <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, their attack has limited effectiveness in the context of synthetic tabular data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Stadler et al. proposed a second attack that uses machine learning to infer the secret attribute of a target record (attribute inference attack). However, in their experiments, the adversary can precisely infer the target record’s sensitive attribute even when the target record is <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">not present in the original dataset</span>. This means that the attack may, in principle, be exploiting population-level associations, making it difficult to assess whether synthetic data actually “remembers” information about the original records (nor, arguably, on whether the SDG mechanism protects privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>). This issue has been referred to as the base rate problem by Houssiau et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we study the privacy leakage from synthetic tabular data in the <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">no-box</span> setting. To that end, we introduce a new attribute inference game with a <em id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">partially informed</em> adversary who has access to two datasets: the synthetic dataset and the ‘quasi-identifiers’ of the records from the original dataset (i.e. all the attributes except the one that is to be inferred). Under our privacy game, the adversary tries to infer the <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">randomized</span> secret attribute of a given record. This solves the base rate problem mentioned above and enables us to evaluate information leakage about individual users. Our main contributions are as follows:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a new attribute inference attack on synthetic data that leverages overly-accurate aggregate statistics computed on the synthetic data. Specifically, our attack does not directly rely on overfitting or overt memorization by the generative model. Instead, the attack is based on linear reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which aims to reconstruct the whole dataset (or column) without targeting specific users or outliers.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We show that many users can in fact be vulnerable to attribute inference attacks against synthetic data, not just outliers. Specifically, our attack can infer a target record’s secret attribute with up to 94.8% probability, compared to a random baseline of 50%. Our attack can increase accuracy by up to 9.6 percentage points compared to prior attacks, when evaluated on our privacy game. This shows that simple heuristics, such as the distance to closest synthetic record, can underestimate the privacy risks of synthetic data.</p>

In particular, we show that, <em id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">for the same trained SDG model</em>, releasing a larger number of synthetic records can result in better utility but worse privacy. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of synthetic data size has not been studied for privacy, and has been mentioned only marginally for utility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. This has important practical implications, suggesting that empirical evaluations on small benchmark datasets can strongly underestimate privacy risk if larger synthetic datasets are then released.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the first membership inference attack (MIA) against machine learning models was proposed by Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, a long line of work has investigated MIAs against generative models. The models under study include large language models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, generative adversarial networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, diffusion models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>, and variational autoencoders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. These prior work have focused both on the <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">white-box</span> setting (where an adversary has full access to the trained model) and on the <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">black-box</span> setting (where an adversary has exact knowledge of the specifications of the generative model). However, in the context of synthetic data, the underlying generative model is typically not shared and the adversary only has access to the generated synthetic dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. Therefore, these prior attacks propose strong adversarial models that may be unrealistic in practice. Here, we instead focus on the <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">no-box</span> setting: the adversary has access to the anonymised synthetic dataset but no information about the underlying generative model or even the specifications of the synthetic data generation algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Early work on attacks against synthetic data have proposed simple heuristics, with the intuition that synthetic datasets might violate privacy if they overtly memorize and output the training data. In such cases, records in the original dataset would appear as-is or with small differences in the synthetic dataset. To quantify privacy leakages, researchers have suggested to compute the distance to closest synthetic record <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, which we refer to as the DCR heuristic. By introducing artificial privacy leakage, Giomi et al. suggest that the DCR heuristic works best when the generative model overtly memorizes training data by generating synthetic records that are very close to or almost the same as records in the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. However, information can leak in many more complex ways than direct memorization as has been previously shown for other types of analyses such as aggregate statistics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of synthetic data, Stadler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> were the first to show that individual-level information can in fact be leaked from synthetic data beyond simple heuristics. In their membership inference attack, Stadler et al. follow the shadow modelling approach of Shokri et al. and show that 4 out of 5 outlier records tested were vulnerable to membership inference attacks. However, even amongst the outlier records, 1 out of 5 achieved close to perfect privacy protections. Additionally, under their framework, all 5 randomly chosen records achieve close to perfect privacy protections which suggests that there is little to no privacy leakage for the average user from synthetic data. While attacks against a small minority of users can be useful to measure theoretical risks, they may not be necessarily relevant in practice especially if the adversary does not have a precise way to recognize vulnerable users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, attribute inference attacks are an understudied area of research in the context of synthetic data. Stadler et al. additionally propose an attribute inference attack where the adversary trains a machine learning classifier on the synthetic data to predict the secret attribute. The adversary then uses this classifier to infer the secret attribute for the target record. However under their privacy game, the adversary could infer the target record’s sensitive attribute <span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">even if the target record was not in the original dataset</span> thus making it hard to determine if enough information pertaining to a specific target record was present in the synthetic data. Therefore, whether synthetic data are vulnerable to attribute inference attacks remains an open question.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduce a new attribute inference attack under the Attribute Inference Privacy Game presented above. Our attack is based on linear reconstruction attacks, that we extended and adapt to specifically perform attribute inference on synthetic data. To the best of our knowledge, linear reconstruction attacks have not been previously studied in the context of synthetic data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Synthetic data aims to serve as a safe replacement for original data while retaining the statistical properties of the original dataset. Therefore, we should expect that statistical queries on the synthetic data are reasonably accurate, with low error compared to original data. Intuitively, this is what our attack exploits. Given the synthetic dataset and the quasi-identifiers of the records in the target dataset, the adversary generates a set of statistical queries that should be preserved by the synthetic data. The adversary then estimates the most likely vector of secret attributes by minimising the error between these statistical queries on synthetic and reconstructed data.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">Here, we adapt the linear reconstruction attack approach originally presented by Dwork et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Linear reconstruction attacks were first presented against data query systems that return noisy answers to queries made over a private dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite><span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>While Dinur and Nissim did not explicitly restrict the attention to interactive data query systems, their attack as originally proposed assumes that the adversary is able to run queries over known sets of users (the <em id="footnote3.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">row-naming</em> problem). While this assumption is realistic in the context of interactive systems (e.g. those supporting SQL), they do not show how the assumption can be met in context such as pre-defined statistics or synthetic data.</span></span></span>. These attacks require random subsets of users to be selected, as it can typically be done using a unique user identifier present in data query systems. To our knowledge, the only linear reconstruction attack in a non-interactive setting was proposed by Kasiviswanathan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, who show that linear reconstruction attacks can theoretically be mounted using <math id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math>-way marginals as well.

Synthetic data generation techniques fall into three categories. Firstly, the traditional statistical paradigm relies on low-dimensional statistical models, including Bayesian networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>, Gaussian and vine copulas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, Markov models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and decision trees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. Secondly, the modern machine learning paradigm relies on high-dimensional deep learning models such as generative adversarial networks (CTGAN) and variational autoencoders (TVAE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>. Finally, the ‘select–measure–generate’ paradigm relies on resampling techniques such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF, also called raking) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, Relaxed Adaptive Projection (RAP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and Adaptive and Iterative Mechanism (AIM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This suggests that benchmark evaluations on small synthetic datasets can understate the practical risks of attribute inference. As a result, we argue that while it may be common currently to only evaluate the privacy risks for the specific synthetic data size that is to be released, privacy evaluations of SDGs should potentially include evaluations on larger synthetic data sizes as well in order to achieve a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the privacy leakage from SDGs. We note, however, that the association between synthetic data size and attack accuracy is not trivial: too large synthetic data sizes could, for instance, result in overflow errors or reach a limit in computational power that may, in turn, lower attack accuracy.</p>

This is a natural consequence of the sampling error (the more records, the more accurate statistics—as demonstrated by NonPrivate).

<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our findings show that protection against inference attacks and utility of synthetic data are both conditioned on multiple factors such as the SDG algorithm, the synthetic data size, and the type of attack. To understand if SDG algorithms can provide sufficient utility while protecting against attribute inference, we systematically evaluate the tradeoffs between attack accuracy and measurement error.</p>

<p id="S6.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Intuitively, differential privacy guarantees that adding, removing, or changing the content of an individual record will not affect much the (distribution of) synthetic datasets that are generated. In our attribute inference privacy game, the challenger randomizes the target record’s secret attribute (see Section <a href="#S7" title="7 Discussion ‣ A Linear Reconstruction Approach for Attribute Inference Attacks against Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>). Differential privacy should therefore significantly reduce the attack accuracy of any potential adversary. At the same time, research shows that differentially private mechanisms can also strongly limit utility and affect model performance in disparate and unpredictable ways <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S7.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There has been a rich literature on linear reconstruction attacks (which led to the formulation of <span id="S7.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The Fundamental Law of Information Recovery</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>), which has thus far not been considered in the context of synthetic data. Informally, the law states that answering too many queries with too much accuracy destroys privacy “in a spectacular way" and is formally defined in relation to linear reconstruction attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Linear reconstruction attacks provide theoretical asymptotic results on the amount of secret information that can be reconstructed when a large fraction of linear queries are answered with insufficient noise by any mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Linear reconstruction attacks are typically studied in the context of systems (e.g. interactive data query systems) that compute some aggregate statistics and add some noise before releasing them (e.g. Gaussian noise subject to clipping and memoization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>). In this work, we see synthetic data as a noise-addition mechanism as well—with the noise being the difference between the aggregate statistic computed on the original data and the same statistic computed on the synthetic data. However, unlike systems that add noise in a coherent way, the noise added by most SDG algorithms does not follow a coherent structure. This work therefore shows that it is in fact possible to extend linear reconstruction attacks to synthetic data in practical settings.</p>

They showed that a naive baseline—outputting the most common value as the secret attribute—outperforms three of the previous state of the art attacks.

Moreover, the partially informed setting can be realistic in the context of multiple data releases. For example, national statistics, public health, and medical institution often publish multiple releases from the same original dataset(s) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Some releases will require a particular disclosure method, e.g. de-identification or pseudonymised microdata for low-risk data, while others will rely on synthetic data generation. This is for instance the case for the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), released both as microdata and as synthetic data (combined with more sensitive IRS tax data) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S7.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, our adversary uses 3-way marginal queries to carry out attribute inference attacks. While higher order marginal queries could also be used to mount our attack, this does not naturally lead to stronger attacks. Including higher order marginal queries (such as 4 and 5-way marginal queries) increases the overall number of queries available to the attack thus increasing the amount of knowledge that can potentially be exploited by our reconstruction attack. At the same time, higher order marginal queries have larger amounts of error, even in the NonPrivate setting, thus reducing the overall power of the attack. In Appendix <a href="#A2" title='Appendix B Attack accuracy of "Adv"_"recon" for varying 𝑘⁢"-way" queries ‣ A Linear Reconstruction Approach for Attribute Inference Attacks against Synthetic Data' class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a>, we empirically show that 3-way queries provide the highest accuracy.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we studied the privacy-utility tradeoffs of synthetic data generation algorithms for tabular data. We showed how to extend and adapt linear reconstruction attacks for synthetic data in order to successfully perform attribute inference even when the adversary has no access to the underlying generative model. We showed that prior attacks can underestimate the privacy risk of synthetic data by up to 10 percentage points compared to our linear reconstruction attack, suggesting that empirical resistance to attacks requires evaluations on multiple attack methods. Furthermore, our work showed that information leakage on arbitrary records is in fact possible from synthetic data. This suggests that when the synthetic data provides good utility, data subjects can in fact be at risk of privacy leakage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our analysis further revealed that generating and releasing a large amount of synthetic records can marginally increase utility while simultaneously enabling much more powerful attacks, a finding that has not been widely studied in prior work. This has important implications when releasing synthetic data: evaluations on small synthetic benchmarks may underestimate the actual risks if larger synthetic datasets are released.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We finally evaluated differentially private synthetic mechanisms.

<div id="S8.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, our results suggest that current synthetic data generation mechanisms may not simultaneously preserve high utility and high privacy at the same time. Privacy-utility tradeoff analyses are highly context dependent and require careful calibration of privacy and utility thresholds to make definitive conclusions. Therefore, synthetic data on its own should not be seen as an all encompassing solution to privacy-preserving data publishing. We hope that our work will support practitioners to evaluate the robustness of synthetic data against violations of privacy and anonymity.</p>

Bayesian networks are trained by building a probabilistic graphical model that represents the conditional dependence between attributes in the original dataset. This graphical model factorizes the joint distribution between the attributes into a product of low dimensional conditional distributions. The algorithm is defined by the degree of the network which is a parameter that defines the number of attributes in the conditional distributions. We use Ping et al.’s implementation in the DataSynthesizer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> library and additionally, set the degree of the network to be 3 in order for 3-way marginal queries to be well preserved in our utility analysis.

The generative network is then trained to eventually output samples that are indistinguishable from samples from the original dataset by the discriminative network. Random noise is then provided as input to the generative network that generates synthetic samples that form the synthetic dataset. CTGAN is a variant of this architecture and uses a conditional generative network (a generative network that receives the class label as input) and mode-specific normalization to generate synthetic datasets in the context of tabular data.

Any association between attributes are removed in the synthetic dataset. In particular, this means the best attribute inference attack simply outputs the most common value of the secret attribute, resulting in an attack accuracy of 0.5. In this setting, the synthetic dataset is expected to have very low utility but have good privacy with respect to attribute inference.
