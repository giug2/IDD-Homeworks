<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider communication-efficient over-the-air federated learning (FL), where multiple edge devices with non-independent and identically distributed datasets perform multiple local iterations in each communication round and then concurrently transmit their updated gradients to an edge server over the same radio channel for global model aggregation using over-the-air computation (AirComp).
We derive the upper bound of the time-average norm of the gradients to characterize the convergence of AirComp-assisted FL, which reveals the impact of the model aggregation errors accumulated over all communication rounds on convergence.
Based on the convergence analysis, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the upper bound to enhance the learning performance, followed by proposing an alternating optimization algorithm to facilitate the optimal transceiver design for AirComp-assisted FL.
As the alternating optimization algorithm suffers from high computation complexity, we further develop a knowledge-guided learning algorithm that exploits the structure of the analytic expression of the optimal transmit power to achieve computation-efficient transceiver design.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed knowledge-guided learning algorithm achieves a comparable performance as the alternating optimization algorithm, but with a much lower computation complexity.
Moreover, both proposed algorithms outperform the baseline methods in terms of convergence speed and test accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the ever increasing volume of distributed data, computing power of edge devices, and concerns of data privacy, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> has recently been recognized as a promising distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm for edge artificial intelligence (AI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
FL exploits the geographically dispersed data and computing power to distill intelligence at the network edge by employing an edge server to coordinate multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a shared ML model in an iterative manner.
By executing the local training based on the local dataset and the up-to-date global model, each edge device only shares its model information instead of raw data with the edge server to alleviate the privacy leakage concerns.
FL is expected to support various intelligent applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, including smart healthcare, industrial Internet of Things (IoT), and autonomous vehicles.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FL over wireless networks has recently attracted considerable attention, where the communication-expensive model/gradient exchange between the edge server and edge devices is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.
Because of limited radio spectrum resource and finite computing power of edge devices, it is crucial to study the communication and computation co-design.
For instance, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposed to jointly optimize the device selection, power control, and bandwidth allocation to minimize the FL training loss.
By jointly optimizing the computation and communication resources, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> developed an efficient algorithm to enable energy-efficient FL over wireless networks.
Most existing studies adopt the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme, e.g., frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA), to ensure that the model update of each participating edge device is successfully received by the edge server before performing global model aggregation.
Such a “communicate-then-compute” strategy may not be spectrum-efficient as the number of required frequency/time resource blocks is proportional to the number of participating edge devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air computation (AirComp)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>,
as an emerging non-orthogonal multiple access technique, has the potential to enable spectrum-efficient wireless model/gradient aggregation.
By exploiting the waveform superposition nature,
AirComp enables the edge server to receive a target nomographic function (e.g., arithmetic mean, weighted average) of the signals concurrently transmitted by multiple edge devices over the same radio channel.
During the model aggregation process of FL, the edge server is only interested in receiving a weighted average of the local model updates from the edge devices, rather than each individual local model update.
Such a model aggregation process matches well with the principle of AirComp, based on which the edge server can directly obtain a noisy version of the aggregated model update by allowing multiple edge devices to concurrently transmit their local model updates.
Such a “compute-when-communicate” strategy requires only one resource block regardless of the number of participating edge devices.
The communication efficiency of AirComp-assisted FL has recently been demonstrated by the existing studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and further enhanced by leveraging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Most existing studies on AirComp-assisted FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> mainly treat each communication round equally important, and optimize the learning performance according to the instantaneous mean squared error (MSE) of the aggregated global model at a typical communication round, which leads to a sub-optimal learning performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
This is because these studies ignore an inherent property of FL, i.e., the training process of FL involves multiple communication rounds and the model aggregation errors across all communication rounds collectively affect the final training performance.
On the other hand, the existing studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> mainly adopt optimization-based methods for the transceiver design of AirComp.
However, the optimization-based methods typically suffer from high computation complexity and require the global channel state information (CSI),
which hinder their practical applications.
These two issues motivate us to develop a both communication and computation efficient
framework to design, analyze, and optimize
AirComp-assisted FL, taking into account the impact of the aggregation errors over all communication rounds on the FL performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider over-the-air FL over a single-cell wireless network, where the edge devices with non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.)
datasets first perform multiple local iterations and then concurrently transmit their gradients to the edge server over the same radio channel using AirComp in each communication round.
Under this setup, we aim to characterize the convergence of the proposed communication-efficient AirComp-assisted FL and further develop a learning-based resource allocation algorithm to enhance the transceiver design, taking into account the model aggregation errors accumulated over all communication rounds.
AirComp-assisted FL and learning-based transceiver design, as two critical components of our proposed unified framework, can be regarded as communication for AI and AI for communication, respectively.

the conventional optimization-based algorithms.

proposed to adapt the frequency of global model aggregation

With a fixed training time budget, a joint bandwidth allocation and scheduling policy was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
By considering imperfect CSI, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposed a joint device scheduling and resource allocation algorithm to improve the training performance.

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To update the global model, the edge server needs to obtain the aggregation of the accumulated local gradients.
Although the OMA scheme can be adopted for gradient uploading in the uplink, e.g., TDMA, the number of required resource blocks scales linearly with the number of edge devices.
When there are a large number of edge devices participating in FL training, the incurred communication latency may be very large and becomes the main performance-limiting factor.
To this end, we resort to using the AirComp technique to reduce the communication latency and thus enable fast gradient aggregation for FL.
Specifically, during the uplink transmission process, all edge devices concurrently transmit their accumulated local gradients to the edge server with appropriate pre-processing over the same radio channel.
By exploiting the waveform superposition property of multiple-access channels, the server is capable of directly receiving an aggregation of all accumulated local gradients.
By enabling all edge devices to transmit concurrently, the communication latency introduced by AirComp is independent of the number of edge devices, thereby achieving communication-efficient global gradient aggregation.</p>

Besides, when the number of edge devices, the number of local iterations, and the learning rate are given, the variance of the stochastic gradient is a constant.
Consequently, in order to improve the convergence performance, it is necessary to minimize the time-average MSE given in (<a href="#S3.Ex1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ III-B Convergence Analysis ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Knowledge-Guided Learning for Transceiver Design in Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), which incorporates the model aggregation errors accumulated over <math id="Thmremark4.p1.3.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="Thmremark4.p1.3.m2.1a"><mi id="Thmremark4.p1.3.m2.1.1" xref="Thmremark4.p1.3.m2.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Thmremark4.p1.3.m2.1b"><ci id="Thmremark4.p1.3.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark4.p1.3.m2.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Thmremark4.p1.3.m2.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> communication rounds.</p>

To minimize the time-average MSE, an intuitive idea is to enlarge the receive normalizing factors to diminish the noise-induced error and adjust the transmit power of edge devices to align the signal amplitudes.
However, the finite average and maximum transmit power budgets make the signal amplitude alignment not always possible.
Hence, it is tricky to simultaneously reduce the signal misalignment error and the noise-induced error.
Moreover, problem (<a href="#S3.E25" title="In III-C Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Knowledge-Guided Learning for Transceiver Design in Over-the-Air Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">25</span></a>) is a non-convex optimization problem as the transmit power of edge devices and the receive normalizing factor are highly coupled over different communication rounds.

it has the following two limitations.
First, the computation complexity of Algorithm 1 is relatively high,
as the iterative algorithm requires a large number of iterations to compute the transmit power of edge devices and the receive normalizing factor.
Besides, one-dimensional bisection search is required in each iteration and hence introduces additional computation complexity.
Second, the alternating optimization algorithm requires the CSI of all communication rounds to solve problem <math id="Thmremark5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathscr{P}" display="inline"><semantics id="Thmremark5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathscript" id="Thmremark5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="Thmremark5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝒫</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Thmremark5.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="Thmremark5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="Thmremark5.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝒫</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Thmremark5.p1.2.m2.1c">\mathscr{P}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The structure mapping layer, which converts the dual variables and the receive normalizing factor to transmit powers of edge devices, is an important component of our proposed learning algorithm.
In particular, the proposed learning algorithm, rather than directing estimating the transmit powers of edge devices, first predicts the dual variables that are key features extracted from the transmit power,
and then utilizes the structure mapping layer to recover transmit power of edge devices from the predicted dual variables.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.6" class="ltx_p">The usage of the structure of the optimal transmit power enables the proposed neural network to efficiently find the optimal transmit power of edge devices and the optimal receive normalizing factor to minimize the signal misalignment error and the noise-induced error.
Compared to the traditional fully-connected neural network that directly estimates the transmit power of edge devices, a salient feature of the proposed neural network is that the structure information is explicitly embedded into network architecture.
It is generally difficult for the conventional fully-connected neural network to learn this structure because of the huge searching space of the transmit power.
By adopting the structure of the optimal transmit power, the searching space of the optimal transmit power can be reduced to a finite-dimensional subspace.

Hence, the finite-dimensional subspace can be further reduced, which in turn reduces the computation complexity of searching for the optimal transmit power.
Although the CSI of multiple communication rounds is required to generate the training samples and to train the neural network,
once the training process is completed, the proposed neural network only needs the CSI of the current communication round to compute the transmit powers of edge devices and the receive normalizing factor.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS3.p2.4" class="ltx_p">An intuitive approach is to directly train a fully-connected neural network that predicts the transmit power of edge devices and the receive normalizing factor without a structure mapping layer.
However, such an intuitive method cannot exploit the specific structure of the optimal solution.
It is difficult for a fully-connected network to find the optimal transmit power without using the structure information.
In contrast, we design the output of the output layer as the dual variables and the receive normalizing factor, i.e.,</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional DL models are usually trained using supervised learning, where the solution to the optimization problem is utilized as the ground truth and the squared error between the output of the neural network and the ground truth is the objective to be minimized.
An obvious drawback of the supervised learning based algorithm is that a large number of labeled samples are required.
However, collecting the optimal solutions to the optimization problem as labels is time-consuming.
We in this paper adopt unsupervised learning, where only the CSI rather than the solutions of the optimization problem <math id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathscr{P}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathscript" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒫</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝒫</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathscr{P}</annotation></semantics></math> is required as training samples.
The parameters of the neural network are optimized by using SGD.
Besides the neural network design, the loss function design is also important in our proposed algorithm.
We design our loss function as time-average MSE plus regularizer as follows</p>

We observe that the error-free transmission achieves the best performance because of the ideal model aggregation.
The proposed alternating optimization algorithm
obtains the optimal solutions of two subproblems and thus achieves the second-best convergence performance.
Besides, the performance gap between the alternating optimization algorithm and the knowledge-guided learning algorithm is quite small.
By exploiting the structure information in terms of the analytical expression of the optimal transmit power,
the proposed knowledge-guided learning algorithm can effectively optimize the transceiver design,
while significantly reduces the computation complexity.
Compared to the full power method, the channel inversion method, and the knowledge-free learning method, the proposed knowledge-guided learning algorithm and the alternating optimization algorithm achieve faster convergence rates and better learning performance.
This demonstrates the importance of the optimization of the transmit power and the receive normalizing factor as well as the exploitation of the structure information.
Similar performance trends in terms of training loss and test accuracy can be observed for all schemes under the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.</p>

As shown in Fig. 4, the test accuracy increases with the number of local iterations.
When the number of local iterations is large enough, the speed of performance increase becomes smaller.
This is because excessive number of local iterations makes the local optimum deviate from the global mimimum
when the datasets are non-i.i.d.
Besides, we observe that the knowledge-guided learning algorithm always achieves a performance close to that of the alternating optimization algorithm
on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
By exploiting the structure of the optimal transmit power,
the proposed knowledge-guided learning algorithm outperforms
the full power, channel inversion, and knowledge-free learning methods.</p>

This is because data redundancy occurs when too many edge devices are involved in FL training.
Fig. 5 also shows that the knowledge-guided learning algorithm is able to achieve comparable performance with the alternating optimzation algorithm under different number of edge devices.
In addition, the knowledge-guided learning algorithm and the alternating optimization algorithm significantly outperform the full power method, the channel-inversion method, and the knowledge-free learning method,
which clearly demonstrates the superiority of our proposed algorithms.</p>

We observe that the computation time
grows as the number of edge devices increases.
The computation time of the knowledge-guided learning algorithm is three orders of magnitude smaller than the alternating optimization algorithm.
This is because the alternating optimization algorithm relies on an iterative process and each iteration involves a bisection search, which are time-consuming.
Results demonstrate that the knowledge-guided learning algorithm is more practical for the transceiver design of AirComp-assisted FL with only marginal decrease in learning performance.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied over-the-air FL, taking in account multiple local SGD iterations and non-i.i.d. data.
We derived the convergence of AirComp-assisted FL in terms of the time-average norm of gradients, followed by formulating an optimization problem to minimize the convergence bound.
We first proposed an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal transmit power of edge devices and the receive normalizing factor, which, however, requires the global CSI and suffers from high computation complexity.
We further developed a knowledge-guided learning algorithm that exploits the domain knowledge to map the instantaneous CSI to the transmit power of edge devices and the receive normalizing factor.
Simulation results demonstrated
that the knowledge-guided learning algorithm achieves a comparable performance as the alternating optimization algorithm, but with a much lower computation complexity.</p>
