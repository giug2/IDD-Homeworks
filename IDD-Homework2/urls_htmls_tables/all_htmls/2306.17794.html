<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">The proliferation of deep learning applications in healthcare calls for data aggregation across various institutions, a practice often associated with significant privacy concerns. This concern intensifies in medical image analysis, where privacy-preserving mechanisms are paramount due to the data being sensitive in nature. Federated learning, which enables cooperative model training without direct data exchange, presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerabilities of federated learning necessitate further privacy safeguards. This study addresses this need by integrating differential privacy, a leading privacy-preserving technique, into a federated learning framework for medical image classification. <em id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">We introduce a novel differentially private federated learning model and meticulously examine its impacts on privacy preservation and model performance.</em> Our research confirms the existence of a trade-off between model accuracy and privacy settings. However, we demonstrate that strategic calibration of the privacy budget in differential privacy can uphold robust image classification performance while providing substantial privacy protection.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Medical imaging, an integral part of modern healthcare, generates vast volumes of data, offering promising opportunities for machine learning applications, particularly in image classification tasks. Such automation can significantly aid disease detection and diagnosis. However, due to the nature of the data, there are often privacy and security concerns. Tackling these issues is critical, especially in the realm of oncology, where timely access to diverse, high-quality data can facilitate improved detection and treatment strategies.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Both benign and malignant tumours are aberrant masses of tissue that are the result of excessive cell division. In a healthy body, there is a controlled cycle of cell birth and death. However, cancer disrupts this balance, leading to unwanted cell growth and potentially forming tumors. Skin lesions, on the other hand, are characterized by localized changes in the skin’s color, shape, size, or texture, often resulting from damage or disease. Since cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation, effective diagnosis methods are needed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Medical image classification serves as a vital component of cancer diagnosis. The advancement of machine learning and computer vision techniques have enabled the automation of medical image classification, thereby reducing the time and manual effort required, and leading to more informed decision-making by medical professionals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, a significant challenge lies in the availability of high-quality, annotated medical image datasets. These datasets, often sensitive and confidential, are difficult to utilize openly for training machine learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL), a deep learning technique, provides a promising solution. FL allows a model to be trained across multiple clients, each holding local data. The local data is not shared, thereby ensuring data privacy and security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Unlike some classical decentralized approaches, FL does not treat data as independent and identically distributed (IID), enhancing the model’s effectiveness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. One of the key challenges of federated learning is that data across different nodes may not be IID. In reality, the data on each node (such as a user’s phone or a particular hospital’s records) may be significantly different from the data on other nodes. This is known as the Non-IID setting. This can occur, for instance, if different users use an app in different ways, or if different hospitals have different patient populations. In FL, the model is taken to the data rather than bringing data to the model. This method enables the inclusion of additional medical images that previously could not be shared due to confidentiality concerns. Despite these advantages, federated learning is not completely immune to potential privacy breaches. Advanced attacks like model inversion or membership inference can still pose threats <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Indeed, while only model parameters are shared and not raw data, it is theoretically possible to extract information about the training data from these parameters.
For instance, a sophisticated adversary might be able to perform what’s known as a <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\say</span>model inversion attack, where they use the shared model parameters to infer sensitive information about the data used to train the model. Even without accessing the raw data, an attacker can use the shared updates to deduce information about the data that contributed to these updates. For more details, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> are suggested.

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Differential Privacy (DP) is a privacy-preserving framework that provides robust mathematical guarantees of privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The fundamental principle of DP is to add calibrated noise to the data or computation results, making it challenging to extract information about individual data points. By ensuring that the output of a computation does not reveal significant details about any individual data point in the input dataset, DP provides an additional layer of privacy protection.
It ensures that the output of a function (in this case, the learned model) is insensitive to changes in any single input (i.e., the removal or addition of any single data point).

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The main focus of this study is on the integration of differential privacy in federated learning for the categorization of medical images, notably images of cancers and skin lesions. We hypothesize that this framework provides robust privacy guarantees, addressing the ethical, legal, and social implications of data sharing in healthcare applications. Additionally, we explore the balance between privacy and model utility through careful calibration of the privacy budget in DP.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Medical image classification involves the task of assigning a class label to an image or a segment of an image, typically related to a specific disease or condition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Deep learning-based methods, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have become the state-of-the-art in medical image classification, achieving remarkable performance in tasks such as detecting lung cancer from CT scans or identifying skin cancer from dermoscopic images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the performance of these models heavily relies on the availability and quality of annotated training data, which can be a challenging prerequisite given the sensitive nature of medical data.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in particular, have emerged as the cutting-edge approach for classifying medical images thanks to their exceptional performance in tasks like identifying skin cancer from dermoscopic images and detecting lung cancer from CT scans <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, given the sensitive nature of medical data, finding annotated training data that is both readily available and high-quality can take time and effort. This is because the effectiveness of these models significantly depends on it.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the advent of Deep Learning has significantly shifted the landscape of medical imaging techniques towards utilizing this powerful approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Initially, Deep Learning architectures like AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-16, and VGG-19 were widely adopted for these tasks. This was later followed by the emergence of Residual Networks (ResNets) and Inception networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, further enhancing the capabilities of medical image classification systems.
Currently, with the growing popularity of transfer learning, various architectures have begun incorporating pre-trained models like GoogLeNet and InceptionV3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. There are even instances of combining multiple pre-trained models, such as an amalgamation of a fine-tuned AlexNet with a pre-trained VGG-16, followed by SVM classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In addition, recent studies have explored utilizing syntactic patterns from medical images through AlexNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and enhancing the quality of images prior to deep learning application <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, despite these advances, a significant concern remains unresolved across the works cited above: the assurance of data privacy and confidentiality. In today’s digitized world, this aspect is becoming increasingly paramount, necessitating the exploration of methods that ensure data security and patient privacy. In response to this demand, our research aims to employ the concept of federated learning to safeguard these concerns.
There have been several recent contributions in the realm of medical imaging that leverage federated learning. For instance, Zheng Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a federated learning framework with dynamic focus for identifying COVID-19 instances in Chest X-Ray images. The unique aspect of this work is the use of training loss from each model as the basis for parameter accumulation weights, enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. Similarly, Jun Luo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed the Federated Learning along with Shared Label Distribution (FedSLD) method for classification tasks. This method strategically adjusts the influence of each data sample on local target during optimization, using knowledge about clients’ label distribution, thereby mitigating instability induced by data heterogeneity.
Additionally, Mohammed Adnan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> applied a differentially private federated learning framework to histopathology image interpretation - one of the most complex and large-scale types of medical images. This work demonstrated that distributed training, with strong privacy guarantees, can achieve results comparable to conventional training.

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Integrating differential privacy into federated learning has been studied for various applications. Before sharing the local model updates with the server for aggregation, this integration often entails introducing noise to them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, this noise addition can degrade the model’s performance, leading to a trade-off between privacy and utility. Adaptive strategies for managing this trade-off have been proposed in other domains, such as adjusting the privacy budget allocation based on the model’s learning progress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.

Each client computes a local model update and adds noise drawn from the Laplace distribution for privacy protection. The privacy budget is allocated adaptively based on the learning progress at each iteration. The server collects the noisy local updates, scales them by the number of samples at each client, and applies them to the global model. The learning rate is adjusted by the decay function. To sum it up we have introduced a novel noise calibration mechanism for differential privacy, an adaptive privacy budget allocation strategy, and a formal analysis of the privacy-utility trade-off in federated learning. These contributions are expected to enhance the security and efficiency of medical image classification systems.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The HAM10000 Skin Image Dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, an acclaimed corpus of dermatoscopic images, has been widely employed in both medical and computer science research domains. This robust dataset, comprising of 10,015 categorized images of pigmented skin lesions, serves as a vital learning tool for various types of skin cancers. The image set encompasses 8,902 benign cases and 1,113 malignant ones. The sheer volume and diversity of this dataset render it a pivotal asset for training and validation of machine learning algorithms, specifically for the development of diagnostic methodologies. Consequently, the dataset has significantly facilitated advancements in the arena of dermoscopic image analysis, thus contributing to the evolution of artificial intelligence applications within the dermatology field.

<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to encapsulate samples from dual independent populations, this comprehensive dataset was bifurcated into two parts. The larger segment was deployed for model fine-tuning, while the other part served as an autonomous client. This step was deemed essential given the scarcity and size constraints of publicly available independent datasets within the medical imaging domain. Preliminary experiments revealed that without initial fine-tuning, client-led federated learning models were prone to overfitting and demonstrated a high degree of learning instability. To mitigate this, a strategic approach was employed wherein the global model was initially fine-tuned on a comparatively extensive dataset. Subsequently, the clients were allowed to proceed with the learning process. This approach ensured persistent client-level independence and effectively controlled overfitting.

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The dataset was subjected to a rigorous pre-processing pipeline to optimize feature extraction and improve model performance. This process involved cropping based on the lesion location, shuffling, normalization, and histogram equalization to enhance image visibility. Moreover, a manual curation process was implemented to include images devoid of distracting elements and outliers into the pre-processed dataset. A paramount facet of federated learning is the independence of client datasets. To ensure this in our study, a custom top model was initially pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This pre-trained model was subsequently fine-tuned on the initial split of the HAM10000 dataset. To generate independent client datasets, four discrete datasets from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) were procured.
In addition, two other pivotal datasets, PH2 and MSK, were utilized to create independent clients for our federated learning system. The PH2 dataset, a publicly accessible skin image database developed by the Dermatology Service of Hospital Pedro Hispano (Portugal), features dermoscopic images of melanocytic lesions. The Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) dataset, on the other hand, is a proprietary source of skin lesion images that adds further diversity and richness to the pool of independent client data. Each of these independent datasets functioned as individual clients within our federated learning system, thereby strictly maintaining the requisite data independence integral to federated learning.</p>

The choice of MobileNetV2 was driven by its superior performance in image classification tasks and its adaptability for transfer learning. This robust, pre-trained model served as the foundation upon which a customized top was placed, designed specifically to cater to our unique task of skin lesion classification. The model was structured in such a way that the base MobileNetV2 model extracted lower-level features from the skin images, while the custom top performed higher-level feature extraction and final classification.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the prevailing privacy concerns in healthcare data, this study has proposed a novel approach to medical image classification that skillfully integrates federated learning with differential privacy, ensuring privacy preservation while maintaining performance efficacy. This is particularly crucial in medical image analysis, given the highly sensitive nature of the data involved. Our methodology has successfully established a secure framework for medical image classification utilizing federated learning. The inherent vulnerabilities of federated learning have been mitigated by integrating differential privacy, thus reinforcing privacy safeguards. We have introduced a novel noise calibration mechanism, adaptive privacy budget allocation strategy, and presented a formal analysis of the privacy-utility trade-off in federated learning. These mechanisms cumulatively contribute to a model that can learn effectively from the data while preserving the privacy of individual contributions. Moreover, the design of the federated learning model and its various components, such as the learning rate decay function, further contribute to its effectiveness. The proposed model exhibited a noteworthy performance in the classification of skin lesion and brain tumor images, demonstrating significant promise for its application in various medical image classification tasks. While the model’s performance is influenced by the number of clients, appropriate parameter tuning can optimize the results.

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p2.2" class="ltx_p">While the study successfully addresses the need for privacy preservation in medical image analysis, it has a few limitations. Firstly, the model’s performance could be affected by the variability in the quality of the images, and the extent of preprocessing required. Secondly, the choice of <math id="S5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math> (privacy budget) in differential privacy is critical to achieving a balance between privacy and model performance. Deciding the value of <math id="S5.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S5.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">ϵ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.2.m2.1.1">italic-ϵ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.2.m2.1c">\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math> requires careful consideration of the particular application and the desired level of privacy. Finally, the trade-off between privacy and utility is inherent in this framework, which mandates further exploration to minimize potential adverse effects on the model’s performance while ensuring optimal privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Looking ahead, future research should explore strategies to optimize the allocation of the privacy budget in differential privacy to improve model accuracy while upholding robust privacy protection. Another promising direction is to explore other noise addition mechanisms and differential privacy techniques that can further enhance the privacy guarantees of the proposed model. Additionally, more extensive testing of the proposed model with diverse datasets, tasks, and in different healthcare contexts can help to further evaluate and refine the approach.</p>
