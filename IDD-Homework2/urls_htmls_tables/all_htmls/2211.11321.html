<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">The applications concerning vehicular networks benefit from the vision of beyond 5G and 6G technologies such as ultra-dense network topologies, low latency, and high data rates. Vehicular networks have always faced data privacy preservation concerns, which lead to the advent of distributed learning techniques such as federated learning. Although federated learning has solved data privacy preservation issues to some extent, the technique is quite vulnerable to model inversion and model poisoning attacks. We assume that the design of defense mechanism and attacks are two sides of the same coin. Designing a method to reduce vulnerability requires the attack to be effective and challenging with real-world implications. In this work, we propose simulated poisoning and inversion network (SPIN) that leverages the optimization approach for reconstructing data from a differential model trained by a vehicular node and intercepted when transmitted to roadside unit (RSU). We then train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the generation of data with each passing round and global update from the RSU, accordingly. Evaluation results show the qualitative and quantitative effectiveness of the proposed approach. The attack initiated by SPIN can reduce up to 22% accuracy on publicly available datasets while just using a single attacker. We assume that revealing the simulation of such attacks would help us find its defense mechanism in an effective manner.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Modern intelligent services demand a communication infrastructure that is both ubiquitous and seamless. Some telecommunication vendors have rolled out the implementation of fifth generation (5G) communication technology that provides a practical estimate of around 20 Gbps of maximum data rate, which is not adequate for end-edge-cloud environments and vehicular network applications that require less than 1ms latency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. One of the motivations for moving towards sixth generation (6G) or beyond 5G communication systems is to achieve high reliability and ultra-low latency for realizing future intelligent applications such as autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Autonomous vehicles and vehicular network applications require the support for high density and scalability in terms of vehicular nodes (end user equipment) along with the governance of sensitive and heterogeneous data in real-time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for applications related to autonomous vehicles to leverage the characteristics of 6G communication networks for realizing intelligent and ubiquitous services.
A basic vehicular network comprises of a road-side unit (RSU), a vehicle, and a cloud component that provides the means for communication and provision of intelligent services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. For instance, traffic and road side information can be acquired through different signs and boards as well as disseminated to other drivers or vehicles in the city for realizing autonomous driving application. Such service may enhance user experience, smart route planning and navigation, efficient traffic management (intersection control), and safe driving experience (smart cruise control), accordingly. 
<br class="ltx_break">An application scenario of dissemination and sharing lidar or visual data for vehicular networks can be considered. Individual vehicles can send the data to a central location for training process and model generation, however, such activity is not only bandwidth inefficient but also makes the individual vehicles vulnerable to several attacks such as leakage of sensitive information, leakage of data, owner information, traffic route, or live access to the vehicle’s camera <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In order to avoid such security concerns and improving bandwidth efficiency, federated learning was proposed, especially in vehicular technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Individual vehicles can train and generate model with small data quantity, followed by the transmission of the trained model instead of data. This process reduces the bandwidth consumption and security concerns, while compromising on service performance such as recognition accuracy. 
<br class="ltx_break">Although federated learning provides some security concerning data privacy, the emergence of model inversion attacks that can reproduce the data from model weights (gradient maps), render federated learning methods vulnerable to security threats. Model inversion attacks are studied in a limited way either in general <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or in the context of medical imaging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Such attacks can not only compromise the privacy of users concerning federated learning models but also can affect the overall recognition performance of aggregated model. Existing studies have shown that the defense mechanism for such attacks either involves adding noise, encrypting local parameters, or using late fusion approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, designing a defense strategy is as good as knowing what the opponent is capable of. Therefore, designing an efficient simulation method for generating attacks will not only help in improving the defense methods but also will provide an evaluation strategy to test the resiliency of existing methods, accordingly. 
<br class="ltx_break">To this extent, we propose the concept of simulated poisoning and inversion network (SPIN) attacks for applications concerning vehicular networks. The SPIN framework consists in three basic steps: i) it uses a differential model for generating the data from model weights (gradients); ii) the generated data undergoes adversarial attacks followed by a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating poisoned data; and iii) a local model is trained and sent to the RSU for aggregation of the global model. We show that after a couple of updates to the global model, the recognition performance drastically decreases, accordingly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simulate poisoning and model inversion attacks in the context of vehicular networks.
<br class="ltx_break">The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II consolidates some of the works related to model inversion and poisoning attacks. Section III discusses the proposed methodology for SPIN. Section IV presents experimental analysis and results and Section V offers the conclusion of the paper.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The emergence of advanced technologies concerning communication, deep learning, and computer vision methods have enabled vehicular network applications, including intelligent traffic management, cooperative driving, and autonomous vehicles. Although the management of large-scale data and safety-critical methods have been hot research topics in vehicular networks for quite some time, currently, data and model security are being emerged as point of concerns for the aforementioned applications. This section provides a consolidated review of studies centred towards federated learning and model inversion attacks for vehicular communication networks. 
<br class="ltx_break">Vehicular technology applications face constraints related to data volume, variety, and velocity. Typically, it is estimated that around 30 TB of data is generated by each vehicle each day. These characteristics of vehicular networks are likely to be supported by 5G and beyond networks. Considering the aforementioned facts, the distributed data from the different vehicles need to be utilized in an efficient manner. The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> provides an in-depth review of comparison between centralized techniques, where the data is sent to a central location (cloud or RSU) for model generation and training, and distributed techniques, which use federated learning that sends local models to the cloud or RSU for model aggregation that enhances the learning accuracy while preserving data privacy. The study suggests that the centralized learning exhibits potential threat of leaking vehicle’s information that may or may not contain user personal information as well, high learning latency, and high network bandwidth usage. On the contrary, federated learning improves the data privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and learning accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Since then, federated learning has been used extensively by a number of studies for vehicular network applications. Some of the studies focus on improvement of learning accuracy and communication efficiency, while others highlight the problem of security, specifically model inversion attacks. 
<br class="ltx_break">Du et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> discussed the integration of federated learning with vehicular communication networks while suggesting several challenges and factors that could be considered for improving federated learning-based vehicular networks. Ye et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> consider the problem of 3D object detection for vehicular network application. Their approach is about aggregating selective models through two-dimension contract theory that eventually improves the interaction between vehicular nodes and RSU. Brik et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> identify several challenges, open issues, and future directions concerning federated learning and wireless networks of unmanned aerial vehicles. Although some of the challenges resonate with the conventional vehicular networks, some others were specific to unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones and air taxis. He et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> focus on the energy-efficiency aspect of the vehicular communication networks in conjunction to federated learning. The study proposes resource allocation algorithms along with importance-aware joint data selection to improve the efficiency as well as the learning speed. 
<br class="ltx_break">Some of the studies (such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>) have considered the security and privacy preservation aspect of federated learning-based vehicular networks by proposing collaborative data leakage protection and content popularity caching methods. However, these studies focus only on the data privacy preservation. A few works have worked on the defense against model inversion attacks with respect to federated learning networks. The idea of model inversion attacks is to reconstruct the sensitive features of the training set from gradients of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Model inversion attacks gained popularity from a study deep leakage from gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> that show how the reconstruction can be carried out. To cope with such attacks, some studies consider adding noise to the input data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and some consider performing intentional initialized attacks to the input data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Recently, Khowaja et al. have proposed PGSL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and Private AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> networks that initialize intentional attacks to the input data as a defense against model inversion attacks. Papernot et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have proposed the method private aggeregation of teacher ensembles (PATE) that adds noise to the labels for defense against model inversion attacks. Pan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> have extended their work to be applied in the context of federated learning approach for preventing model inversion attacks. Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> have proposed the use of homomorphic encryption and blockchain technologies to preserve the deep learning model’s privacy. A study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> has used GANs to mimic samples from training data in a federated learning-based network by creating a replica of global model as discriminator. Their idea is to train the GAN network based on the updates of the global model in order to better generate the training samples. The problem with this method is that it assumes the acquisition of global model and the training data to begin with. This study is unique in the sense that it does not need training data and the proposed network will induce the model poisoning attack in a subtle way, i.e. slow poisoning. To the best of our knowledge, none of the works provided a systematic way to simulate the model inversion attacks and gradually corrupt the decision systems through model poisoning in the context of federated learning-based vehicular network applications.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed SPIN architecture for simulating attacks is shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II Related Work ‣ SPIN: Simulated Poisoning and Inversion Network for Federated Learning-Based 6G Vehicular Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The scenario depicts that convolutional neural network (CNN) models are trained with vehicular and traffic information data at data owners side. The model parameters are then sent to the RSU for further model aggregation and updated model is sent back to the data owners (vehicles) through the global update. In addition, the scenario also depicts that an attacker can intercept model parameters and initiate model inversion attack to reconstruct the data, accordingly. The estimated reconstructed data is then sent to generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate similar data with added poisoning to the pixels and labels, accordingly. A model is trained on the poisoned data and is sent to the RSU as one of the model parameters for aggregation. The global update will also be received by the attacker and with every update the discriminator is updated which makes the generator more stronger and resilient, hence, with passing updates, the model poisoning attack will start disrupting the model’s performance for all the vehicles that will apparently receive the updates from the RSU. We provide the details for the model inversion attack and model poisoning attack modules in the subsequent subsections, respectively.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.17" class="ltx_p">As suggested earlier, the studies showed that bringing the dummy gradients close to the intercepted gradients through optimization eventually realizes dummy data close to the real one. Therefore, the optimization function to obtain the reconstructed data by reducing the gap between dummy gradients and original one is shown in equation 4.</p>

The discriminator network is trained to distinguish between real and fake data while the generator network generates the training data by mimicking discriminative network. A study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> used GANs to mimic samples from training data in a federated learning-based network by creating a replica of global model as discriminator. Thus, the study assumes the acquisition of global model as well as training data to begin with, which this study does not considers. We generate the data by applying model inversion attacks, accordingly. However, once the data is generated, we apply model poisoning by changing the labels. Subsequently, the attacker receives the model updates in the form of global model, which is replicated and used as the discriminator to improve the poisoned data generation process. Therefore, high quality poisoned data can be generated with each passing update.

<br class="ltx_break">In the proposed work, we set the number of vehicles to 9, along with a single attacker scenario, suggesting that out of 10 participants one would be attacker and 9 would be normal/benign vehicles. For the model inversion attack module, we have used the learning rate of 0.5, number of iterations 10, optimizing iterations 1k, and history size 100 along with L-BFGS method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. For the model poisoning attack part, the benign vehicles will train with learning rate of 0.05 for 4 local epochs while the attacker is trained with the learning rate of 0.01 for 10 local epochs. The learning rate for attacker decays by 20% after every 3 epochs. All the experiments are carried out using federated learning-based methods for 100 communication rounds. After every iteration, the models from vehicles will be averaged sequentially to construct a global model. We chose PyTorch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> framework for our experiments based on federated learning settings. The experiments are carried out on a PC having RTX3060Ti GPU with 32GB of RAM.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection, we show the generative effectiveness of the proposed model in a federated learning-based vehicular network system. The number of vehicles in this case is 9, whereas a single attacker scenario is considered. The results for the generated images on MNIST and GTSRB and their comparison with real images are shown in Figure 2. Although we have shown only 4 generated classes from MNIST, it should be noted that this study considers all ten classes for MNIST and only four classes from GTSRB, accordingly. The results show that without accessing the data from start, the proposed method can traverse the data from differentiable model in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we define the main task accuracy as the success rate of the recognition task when the model poisoning attack is not initiated. The term without model poisoning attack refers to the addition of model that is trained on the data reconstructed through model inversion attacks. Finally, the SPIN refers to the model inversion and poisoning attack. The experiments are performed on both the MNIST and the GTSRB datasets. The results for both datasets are shown in Figure 3 and 4, respectively. 
<br class="ltx_break">For the main task accuracy, we used the models from 9 benign vehicles that participated in federated learning process. It is shown that the accuracy of around 97% and 94% is achieved on both datasets. For the experiment without model poisoning attack, we used 9 benign vehicles and 1 attacker to participate in the federated learning process. In the initial phase of data generation, the accuracy does not improve much for GTSRB dataset, however, as the updates are being sent, the generation process is improved along with the accuracy, which is around 98% for both the datasets. It should be noted that we did not poison the labels for this experiment to show the effectiveness of the data generation process. Similar trend is noticed for the attack scenario, where 9 benign vehicles and 1 attacker participated in the federated learning process, but, this time, we initiated poisoning attack. It can be noticed that in the beginning, due to not that good generation of samples, the accuracy does not degrade significantly, however with passing of communication rounds and acquiring global updates, the generation process is improved. This leads to significant degradation in accuracy for both the datasets, accordingly. The accuracy decreases up to 19% and 22% for MNIST and GTSRB datasets, respectively. We assume that the results for attacks from SPIN architecture are quite effective, considering that only 1 attacker participated in this process.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study has proposed a novel simulated poisoning and inversion network (SPIN) for initiating attacks in federated learning-based vehicular applications for beyond 5G and 6G networks. We have shown the effectiveness of the proposed inversion attack module and the generator network to recover the data from differential model. The proposed work has illustrated the efficacy of attacks by mimicking the data from model and then poisoning the labels with respect to federated learning process. It is a kind of a sneak attack that camouflages itself as one of the participant by reconstructing the data from the differential model rather than invading other participant’s data for generating poison attack. The assumption in the proposed scenario is quite realistic and is compliant with the emerging threats for current political and security situations. We have also shown that the generation process improves with each passing round and global updates, accordingly. 
<br class="ltx_break">As future work, we plan to conduct more experiments with varying number of attackers and benign vehicles to validate the efficacy of SPIN architecture. Furthermore, we also intend to propose a defense mechanism for such attacks concerning federated learning-based vehicular applications.</p>
