<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">As one of the typical settings of Federated Learning (FL), cross-silo FL allows organizations to jointly train an optimal Machine Learning (ML) model. In this case, some organizations may try to obtain the global model without contributing their local training power, lowering the social welfare. In this paper, we model the interactions among organizations in cross-silo FL as a public goods game and theoretically prove that there exists a social dilemma where the maximum social welfare is not achieved in Nash equilibrium. To overcome this dilemma, we employ the Multi-player Multi-action Zero-Determinant (MMZD) strategy to maximize the social welfare. With the help of the MMZD, an individual organization can unilaterally control the social welfare without extra cost. Since the MMZD strategy can be adopted by all organizations, we further study the case of multiple organizations jointly adopting the MMZD strategy to form an MMZD Alliance (MMZDA). We prove that the MMZDA strategy can strengthen the control of the maximum social welfare. Experimental results validate that the MMZD strategy is effective in obtaining the maximum social welfare and the MMZDA can achieve a larger maximum value.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Federated Learning (FL), clients cooperatively train a Machine Learning (ML) model with their decentralized datasets under the coordination of a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. One of the typical settings of FL is cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> where a neutral third-party agent acts as the central server and clients are a group of organizations, aiming to jointly train an optimal ML model for their respective use. In this case, these organizations are also the owners of the global model and can utilize the well-trained global model to further process tasks for their own interests.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An optimal global model with high performance requires the organizations in cross-silo FL to collaborate efficiently so as to bring considerable benefits to all participants. The cooperative behavior of organizations participating in global aggregation can improve the social welfare. In fact, there are many studies on optimizing the social welfare in cross-silo FL by improving the model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, increasing the convergence speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, reducing the communication cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, protecting privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and security <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, since every organization in cross-silo FL can obtain the final global model regardless of its contribution, the well-trained model becomes a public good, which is non-excludable and non-rivalrous for all organizations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This leads to selfish behaviors that some organizations may only consider their own interests via inactively participating in local training to obtain the final global model for free or at a lower cost. The spread of this behavior can result in a huge loss of the social welfare, and then none of the organizations can get the optimal model, which compromises the long-term stability and sustainability of cross-silo FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the existing studies improve the social welfare by designing incentive mechanisms to promote organizations’ full cooperation in cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, incentive mechanism requires extra negotiation costs since organizations need to reach a consensus on the mechanism in advance. And it also demands additional running costs, where a distributed algorithm runs over all organizations, clearly adding more burden to organizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we model the interactions among organizations in cross-silo FL into a public goods game, named cross-silo FL game. Instead of incentivizing organizations’ participation, we take a brand-new approach using the Multi-player Multi-action Zero-Determinant (MMZD) strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to directly maximize the social welfare in cross-silo FL without causing additional negotiation costs and running costs for all organizations. Moreover, the MMZD Alliance (MMZDA) formed by multiple MMZD players is studied to explore whether a better maximum value of the social welfare can be achieved. Another outstanding advantage of our methods is that they can be applied to any cross-silo FL scenario no matter what strategies or actions other organizations perform.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works related to cross-silo FL can be classified into three categories: the optimization of aggregation algorithm, security and privacy protection, and the incentive mechanism design.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Aggregation algorithms are developed to enhance the performance of cross-silo FL. Based on the original FedAvg algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, various algorithms to improve the convergence speed, accuracy, and security were proposed in cross-silo FL setting. Marfoq et al. introduced practical algorithms to design an averaging policy under a decentralized model for achieving the fastest convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. And Huang et al. proposed FedAMP to overcome non-iid challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Zhang et al. reduced the encryption and communication overhead caused by additively homomorphic encryption, which lowered the cost of aggregation as well <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Security and privacy protection issues also received attention in cross-silo FL. Heikkil et al. combined additively homomorphic secure summation protocols with differential privacy to guarantee strict privacy for individual data subjects in the cross-silo FL setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Li et al. proposed a brand-new one-shot algorithm that can flexibly achieve differential privacy guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Jiang et al. designed FLASHE, an optimized homomorphic encryption scheme to meet the requirements of semantic security and additive homomorphism in cross-silo FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Chu et al. proposed a federated estimation method to accurately estimate the fairness of a model, namely avoiding the bias of data, without infringing the data privacy of any party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Many incentive mechanisms based on auction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, contract <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, and pricing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> were proposed for FL since the performance of FL is affected by clients’ behaviors. Unfortunately, most of schemes cannot be adapted to the cross-silo FL directly. Only a few studies successfully conducted incentive mechanisms in cross-silo FL to encourage organizations to participate in global aggregation. Tang et al. proposed an incentive mechanism for cross-silo FL to address the organization heterogeneity and the public goods characteristics by solving a non-convex optimization problem<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Li et al. proposed an incentive mechanism for the cross-silo FL scenario, stimulating the organizations to provide more high-quality data by deploying a knowledge distillation algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Zeng et al. considered cross-silo FL as a perfectly competitive market, proposing the Cournot model,
Stackelberg-Cournot model, and Cournot-Stackelberg model to analyze the economical behaviors of organizations<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Zhang et al. explored the long-term participation of organizations in cross-silo FL by calculating their equilibrium participation strategy, where an algorithm was designed for organizations to reduce free riders and increase the amount of local data for global aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, the application of incentive mechanisms in cross-silo FL scenario still faces many challenges. First of all, most of the existing incentive mechanisms focus on encouraging more organizations to participate in cross-silo FL, instead of improving the performance of the global model from the perspective of the social welfare. Secondly, the global model in cross-silo FL has the non-exclusive nature of public goods, leading to potential free-riding behaviors, which is rarely considered in the existing research. Last but not least, current incentive mechanisms usually require participants or servers to spend additional computing resources. As a result, complex designs and additional computing costs can bring a burden on the organizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the above analysis, our work is distinct with the existing approaches in the following aspects. First, our study reveals the social dilemma in the cross-silo FL. Second, we are committed to directly maximizing the social welfare to overcome the social dilemma. Moreover, we adopt the MMZD strategy without additional cost to control the maximum value of the social welfare. Furthermore, we use the MMZDA to further expand the ability to control the maximum value of the social welfare.</p>

<p id="S3.p9.1" class="ltx_p">If the organization only pursues its own interest and does not participate in the communication round for global aggregation, it will lead to a low social welfare. From the perspective of an individual organization, free riding is an attractive action to get the final global model at a low cost. However, when all organizations are free riders, the model performance can be poor, which is unfavorable for everyone. Therefore, an organization cannot arbitrarily choose the free riding behavior for its own benefit without considering the social welfare. From the perspective of collective, if all organizations only look out for their own interests, the model performance of cross-silo FL systems will degrade as selfish behavior spreads.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to the analysis above, we can see that the underlying cause of the social dilemma is selfishness, leading to the loss of all organizations, namely the low social welfare. All organizations are reluctant to face the bad consequences of low social welfare, so in this section, we explore whether an organization can maximize the social welfare as much as possible in the cross-silo FL game. We start by analyzing an organization’s strategy.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous section, we have proved that by adopting MMZD strategies, individual organizations can maximize social welfare in the cross-silo FL game.

Therefore, it is possible that multiple organizations utilize the MMZD strategy at the same time. Then how will this affect the control of the social welfare maximization in the cross-silo FL game?

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we model the cross-silo FL game among organizations as a public goods game, revealing the social dilemma in the cross-silo FL game theoretically. In order to overcome the social dilemma, we propose a brand-new method using the MMZD to solve the social welfare maximization problem. By the means of the MMZD, an individual organization can unilaterally control the social welfare at a certain level, regardless of other organizations’ strategies. Meanwhile, we explore the MMZDA consisting of multiple MMZD organizations, which further improves the control of the maximum social welfare. Moreover, our approaches can maintain the stability and sustainability of the system without extra cost. Simulation results prove that the MMZD strategy can efficiently and effectively control the social welfare. Furthermore, the MMZDA achieves a larger maximum social welfare, which shows its superiority in reducing the loss from selfish behaviors.</p>
