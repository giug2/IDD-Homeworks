<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Significant research effort has been devoted in recent years to developing personalized pricing, promotions, and product recommendation algorithms that can leverage rich customer data to learn and earn. Systematic benchmarking and evaluation of these causal learning systems remains a critical challenge, due to the lack of suitable datasets and simulation environments. In this work, we propose a multi-stage model for simulating customer shopping behavior that captures important sources of heterogeneity, including price sensitivity and past experiences. We embedded this model into a working simulation environment — RetailSynth. RetailSynth was carefully calibrated on publicly available grocery data to create realistic synthetic shopping transactions. Multiple pricing policies were implemented within the simulator and analyzed for impact on revenue, category penetration, and customer retention. Applied researchers can use RetailSynth to validate causal demand models for multi-category retail and to incorporate realistic price sensitivity into emerging benchmarking suites for personalized pricing, promotions, and product recommendations.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the growth of digital marketing and e-commerce, retailers have invested in building AI systems for targeted sales promotions, dynamic pricing in brick-and-mortar and online stores, product search and recommendation services, and online advertising <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In diverse fields such as econometrics, marketing science, recommendation systems, and reinforcement learning (RL), there has been relentless development of ever-more sophisticated predictive models and decision-making algorithms for retail marketing. Progress is often claimed if a new model is better in predicting held-out data than previous ones or a new algorithm performs better in an isolated A/B test, but reliability and reproducibility challenges are well-documented <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Consequently, there has been a shift towards building data-centric AI platforms that host benchmark datasets, online evaluation methods, and baseline implementations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless, the challenge of reliably evaluating and benchmarking retail AI systems is growing. Practitioners are shifting focus from simple item recommendation to value-aware recommendation and causal decision-making algorithms that are designed to dynamically optimize the economic value from recommendations for both firms and consumers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, evaluation of these more complex systems requires more complete, longitudinal datasets. Existing public datasets are unreasonably small when compared to typical industry datasets, collected under biased and often unknown marketing policies, and missing many key fields required to accurately model customer behavior <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Within the retail industry, there are privacy and competitive concerns that make it unlikely the status quo of poor availability of realistic public datasets will change anytime soon. In addition, there are business constraints and fairness concerns that prevent aggressive experimentation across the marketing mix—product, place, promotion, and price. Within the AI community, offline evaluation based on static datasets remains the de facto standard, due to its simplicity and low computational cost. However, it will remain difficult to achieve a mechanistic understanding of AI systems, relying only on offline evaluation of historical data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given these challenges, we expect an increasing reliance on Monte Carlo simulation for assessing short-term and long-term impacts of AI systems and for assessing their performance against strategic objectives. More specifically, we see a need for access to fully synthetic data that reasonably mimics customer buying behavior to facilitate collaboration between academic and industrial researchers, without risking customer privacy or trade secrets and to test the robustness of AI systems to changes in the environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To enable building realistic evaluation environments for retail AI, we introduce the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RetailSynth</span> simulation environment, focusing initially on customer-level simulation of multi-category retail, with price as the primary decision variable <span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>Code available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RetailMarketingAI/retailsynth" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url">https://github.com/RetailMarketingAI/retailsynth</a></span></span></span>. Our simulation environment addresses several key challenges specific to retail marketing:</p>

</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We develop an interpretable multi-stage decision framework that leverages econometric theory and covers the full set of decisions: visiting a store, selecting categories and products to purchase, and deciding the quantity to purchase. Each decision stage is sensitive to individual customer preferences, as represented by the utility values for products within the retailer’s assortment. Product utilities are determined by the union of customer and product attributes and marketing mix variables; keeping product utilities central to our framework makes it both interpretable and simple to calibrate to real-world conditions. We provide a detailed account of how we calibrated the synthetic data model and show how the choice distributions and aggregate buying behavior compare to a real-world dataset. Following econometric theory, we calculated the elasticity for each decision-stage and used these results to verify that the sensitivity of consumers to price is heterogeneous and leads to realistic differences across customer segments. In addition to verifying the simulator agrees with the theory at the detailed level, we present a detailed scenario analysis, showing how customer demand shifts under realistic baseline pricing policies that vary the depth and frequency of promotional discounts. We show that, in addition to capturing broad behavioral changes in response to discounted prices, the calibrated simulator produces complex, heterogeneous behavior across customer segments differing in their price sensitivity. This differential price response across customers implies that AI-driven personalization can result in a significant uplift in our environment and motivates future applications of the simulator.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our ambition is to build a full ecosystem of evaluation tools for retail AI. RetailSynth can serve immediately as a fundamental building block to test algorithms that aggressively flex marketing-mix variables, providing a simplified, ground-truth model of customer behavior that we expect to be applicable across domains ranging from grocery to fashion. As designed, RetailSynth can scale to predict shopping behavior across product assortments and customer populations of arbitrary size and enables rigorous evaluation of complex predictive models and recommendation algorithms through simulation. As data-sharing and experimentation become more common in the retail ecosystem, we expect data-driven methodologies for synthetic data generation to become more common and more useful. Accordingly, we provide a detailed account of the calibration procedure and our methodology for evaluating the fidelity of synthetic data to the real-world retail dataset so that others can follow the same playbook for validating future synthetic data generation schemes. We expect to see retail AI systems take over strategic decisioning from human managers only once the safety, fairness, and reliability of these systems has been well-established. It is our hope that this simulation framework can help accelerate the ongoing development and evaluation of retail AI systems.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The value of synthetic data for accelerating the development of AI systems has been broadly recognized, with a recent emphasis on building generative models of the data in its raw tabular forms, rather than modeling features derived from aggregated and transformed data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Privacy-preserving modeling techniques (such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Networks) have been applied to generate synthetic data, while conforming to differential privacy guarantees <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. For example, Athey and Imbens <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> leveraged Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks to generate artificial data for evaluation of causal effects estimators. These privacy-preserving modeling techniques are powerful when sufficient historical data is available to learn an accurate data-generating process. When data is scarce, there is a rich tradition within econometrics of specifying structural causal models for generating synthetic data that can be used to validate new models and algorithms, with the caveat that the data may be highly stylized and lack the complexities of real-world data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. For example, Andrews and co-workers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> simulated customer brand-choice within a single category based on a nested logit model—an approach which we extend in this work to encompass multiple categories.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To generate synthetic data, we rely on models that fit in the long tradition of consumer choice modeling based on utility-maximization theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In retail marketing, these models are typically used to inform marketing-mix decisions and resource allocation; over the past several decades, there has been recognition that jointly modeling purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity makes the models more accurate and is required to fully capture consumers’ decision-making process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Extending this approach to big data, McAuley and team developed a nested, feature-based matrix factorization framework to jointly model preferences and price sensitivities of individual consumers and showed that this approach could scale across large, multi-category assortments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. They modeled each decision stage of category choice, product choice, and item quantity selection independently and showed that the model could accurately predict future consumer behavior. They did not, however, consider the impact of changes in promotion policy (i.e. discount depth and frequency) on consumer purchasing behavior, and so it remains untested whether such a complex model can be reliably used for personalized promotion optimization and yield increases in customer lifetime value. We built RetailSynth to help answer these questions about how consumers respond to large changes in price and promotion policy, and we compare its capabilities to a variety of other methods in the Discussion section <a href="#S5" title="5 Discussion ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Understanding consumer behavior over longer time periods is typically accomplished with Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) models and is considered challenging due to the need to predict future purchases based on limited purchase history and dynamic preferences. When using CLV models to plan promotions, customers are typically ranked by expected value to the firm and different marketing interventions are applied to different customers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Common CLV models assume that customer purchase behavior is defined by frequency and average transaction value and that customers become inactive after a limited period <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. One of the earliest models to take hold for predicting time between purchase events was the negative binomial distribution, which relies on the simple assumption that customers have individual purchase rates that follow a Poisson distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. In the big data era, it makes more sense, however, to use approaches, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or deep-learning-based sequence models, that account for customer features and marketing activities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. In that spirit, we incorporate customer features and marketing mix variables into our model for customer purchase events and store visit behavior so that the customer lifetime value estimate is dynamic and responsive to changes in marketing policy.</p>

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Cutting-edge methods integrate customer value measurement with online decisioning. For example, Liberali and Ferecatu blended bandit decision-making with dynamic customer value estimation using HMMs; however, initialization was costly, requiring a randomized controlled trial to generate unbiased model calibration data and avoid a "cold start" <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. For recommendation systems, the cold-start problem is well-known and one of the key reasons that simulation is required for assessing the dynamic performance of systems that must learn and earn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The base components of these simulation systems are the environment and recommendation agent. The value estimate in the environment is typically based either on a causal model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or off-policy evaluation of historical data, using methods like doubly robust evaluation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. There is an immense variety of approaches to recommendation, ranging from static filtering to off-policy optimization to on-policy optimization, with RL approaches receiving much attention due to their ability to optimize for long-term rewards <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Within retail, RL algorithms have been developed for dynamic pricing, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and there have been early efforts to develop marketplace simulation platforms for algorithm evaluation, such as <span id="S2.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Price Wars</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Each component of the above can be encoded using a generative model. We follow a hierarchical modeling approach similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> to specify the various sub-models, while taking note of several key considerations. First, the decision-making process is not always linear and may involve multiple iterations across these steps — we make a simplifying assumption that each customer purchase decision is conditionally independent. Second, our model adopts a simplifying assumption of independence between category choices. This assumption is essential to avoid the curse of dimensionality, which might make the simulation intractable at industrial scale. However, in reality, individual category purchase decisions are interdependent, often influenced by factors such as product complementarity. Third, in real-world systems, individual decision-makers show significant variation in product preferences and price sensitivity due to unobserved and idiosyncratic factors that may vary over time. While we incorporate latent heterogeneity into the data synthesizer, we do not address time-varying changes in customer preference.</p>

This assumption of category independence helps us scale the data synthesizer to real-world settings, as each category can be run in parallel.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.5" class="ltx_p">In our framework, the store visit is a binary choice to shop at any store or digital property belonging to the retailer, as we are not explicitly modeling individual stores. Therefore we employ a Bernoulli distribution to generate the probabilities. We assume that previous store visits and current marketing activity influence the decision in the current time period.

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Typical retail datasets do not include a complete price history for all products, as they are produced by legacy systems that log only transactions. Therefore, we need to impute the complete price histories. A common approach is to assume the price at any time equals the most recently observed purchase price, but this approach can suffer from significant observational bias, if products are rarely purchased at their original price <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>

We take into account the following constraints: (1) A product has a baseline price that is usually stable over extended periods of time; (2) depending on the product type, there should be either frequent or infrequent discounting events; (3) discount depth should be less than the profit margin for the category. While there are a variety of pricing policies that fit within these constraints, we implement a high-low pricing strategy as a reasonable baseline.</p>

The product table included a comprehensive category hierarchy, covering product department, product category, and product type. Key transaction details, such as item quantity, transaction sales amount, and discounts, were recorded, enabling the derivation of unit prices and discounts. While household demographic data was available for a subset of 801 households, the lack of data for 60% of the households led us to omit demographic information from our analysis.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We derived important insights into both the pricing strategy adopted by the retailer and household buying behavior through our analysis of purchase histories. Across all transactions, 50% of transactions have a discount involved, at an average discount depth of 26% with a standard deviation of 15%. For most products, the number of transactions each week was not sufficient for us to infer the details of the pricing policy. For some more frequently purchased products, we looked at the historical pricing trends over successive weeks. Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Data description and analysis ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> illustrates the unit price trajectory for a randomly selected trio of high-volume products within each of the Flavored Drinks, Bacon, and Packaged Candy categories. From inspection of the data, any notion that product pricing was set randomly is immediately dispelled. Instead, there often appears to be a baseline price and discounts offered at varying discount depths and frequencies. There are products that were seldom discounted (e.g., the Flavored Water category) as well as products that were frequently discounted (e.g., the Bacon category, the Packaged Candy category). Within products that got a discount, there is a difference in discount depth and frequency.

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the remainder of this section, we discuss how we calibrated the synthesizer to match selected probability distributions from the Complete Journey data. Our calibration process was guided by two key objectives. The primary objective was to match the choice probability distributions from the four decision stages outlined in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Multi-stage data generating framework ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> as closely as possible to the real-world data (see Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf1" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Synthesizer specification and calibration ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(a)</span></a>). Our secondary objective was to ensure agreement of key customer behaviors such as time since last purchase (customer recency), total categories purchased per customer per week (category penetration), total items purchased per customer per week (basket size), and total items purchased per product per week (sales volume) (see Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Synthesizer specification and calibration ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a>). We iteratively adjusted the form of the sub-models and exact parameters of the prior distributions to roughly meet these objectives (For an example of how the sub-models are specified, see Section <a href="#S3.SS6" title="3.6 Bayesian data generation process ‣ 3 Multi-stage data generating framework ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.6</span></a>.)</p>

This metric can take a value between 0 and 1 inclusive, where a score of 1 signifies identical distributions, while a score of 0 indicates entirely dissimilar distributions. Since we aimed to match multiple distributions, we calculated the KS-Complement metric for each distribution and set the optimization objective as a sum of the metric values computed for individual distributions. Our initial tuning runs focused on matching the category size and pricing distribution observed in the Complete Journey data.

However, the empirical distributions have heavier right tails than the synthetic data (Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Synthesizer specification and calibration ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Through this initial tuning process, we discovered that we could not perfectly fit the heavy tails of many of the distributions due to the model assumptions and linkages between different choice stages. We observed that including the metric for every distribution of interest in our optimization scheme was counterproductive and often led to worse results than focusing on fitting the distributions that were more difficult to match. Consequently, our final tuning run maximized the metrics only for the category purchase probability and category count distributions.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">This calibration strategy gave us fits that are not perfect but are more than suitable for the task at hand of building a simulator that can be used to understand and to compare various AI algorithms. More importantly, the customer behavior in the simulator is dynamic and heterogeneous, which we explore further in Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Scenario analysis ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>. For all customer decision stages, the KS-Complement metric in Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf1" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Synthesizer specification and calibration ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(a)</span></a> consistently exceeds 0.82, highlighting a strong degree of similarity between the synthesizer’s output and the real-world Complete Journey data. The fit is particularly impressive for the product purchase and item quantity distributions. The category choice probability, however, diverges with the synthetic data by having an excess of categories with low purchase probability and an extended tail. This mismatch, particularly at both distributional extremes, diminishes the accuracy of the aggregate purchase behavior. The basket size and category penetration distributions for the synthetic data (Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Synthesizer specification and calibration ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a>) have imperfect fits, which we attribute to basket composition. The synthetic data tends to include too few small baskets, containing 1-2 categories, and too few large baskets of 35 or more categories. This discrepancy is an expected side effect of not modeling product complementarity. As discussed in Section <a href="#S4.SS1.SSS2" title="4.1.2 Category choice analysis ‣ 4.1 Data description and analysis ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1.2</span></a>, we do not capture the sequential effect where customer purchases in one category lead to additional purchases in another and an overall larger basket with more categories purchased. Despite this shortcoming, the model accurately captures overall revenue and customer retention, as the distributions for customer recency and per-item sales volume show (Figure <a href="#S4.F6.sf2" title="In Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Synthesizer specification and calibration ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6(b)</span></a>).</p>

As noted in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Multi-stage data generating framework ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, there are, however, several additional sources of variation that can potentially drown out the price sensitivity. To demonstrate that the variation in price sensitivity is significant, we computed the price elasticity of demand per customer, per product using Equation <a href="#A3.E21" title="In Appendix C Price elasticity for synthetic data model ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">21</span></a>.

We also examined the relationship between product preference and price sensitivity to determine if we observed a strong correlation.

In agreement with previous finding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a majority of customers fall within a relatively narrow range of price sensitivities and that the more price-sensitive customers display a wider range of expected purchase amounts. This observation is consistent with the intuition that customers with a strong preference for a product are less price-sensitive, whereas those with a weak preference have a range of price sensitivities.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Having established that there was variability in customer response to prices, we wanted to validate that the magnitude of the response at the individual level was large enough to significantly affect the aggregate measure of a retail firm’s performance under a range of realistic pricing scenarios.

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We designed an experiment where we systematically varied discount depth and frequency and then monitored the effect on customer spending, category penetration, and retention while accounting for the potential profit margin impact. Our primary hypothesis was that our metrics would become saturated under different minimum discount depths and frequencies for different customer segments, indicating there would be a potential benefit to deploying AI-powered personalization. We also systematically screened for an effect of discount frequency since low-frequency discount events avoid the risk of customer fatigue, while more frequent discounting can be expected to improve customer retention. We wanted to make sure that marketing resource allocation was reflected in the scenarios. We posited that at any given time, the intensity of discounting and the intensity of marketing should be highly correlated and that this should have a strong impact on consumer perception of the firm.

<div id="S4.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To mimic common industry practice, we set design constraints that the discount state should not occur more than 60% of the time on average and the average discount depth should not exceed 50%. We then designed scenarios where the time-averaged discount levels ranged from 3% to 24% (Table <a href="#S4.F8.sf2" title="In Figure 8 ‣ 4.3 Scenario analysis ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8(b)</span></a>). For the lower two discount levels, we ran a low-frequency and high-frequency scenario, where the percentage of time spent in the discount stage was either 30% or 60% respectively. To make the pairwise comparison of high- and low-frequency scenarios valid, we kept the time-averaged discount level the same. For the highest discount level, we ran only the high-frequency scenario, so as not to exceed the discount depth constraint.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">After running the various scenarios, we computed the aggregate outcome metrics across all customers and products. Intuitively, one expects that the deeper the discount, the larger the impact on the metrics, and this is indeed the case. Looking at Figure <a href="#S4.F8.sf1" title="In Figure 8 ‣ 4.3 Scenario analysis ‣ 4 Results ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8(a)</span></a>, we see that the realized discounts (average discounts applied to purchased items) and overall demand are proportional to the discount depth. This implies that customer demand is concentrated during the discounting events, otherwise the realized discounts would be proportional to the effective discount. For policies I and II the effect of discount depth and frequency is muted, indicating a weak response to low discounts. For policies III, IV, and V, we see a sharp trade-off between overall demand and revenue. Here, the selection of an optimum pricing policy depends on whether the firm is prioritizing growth or profitability. Policies IV and V, which offer deeper discounts, resulted in increased demand, higher category penetration, and improved customer retention compared to Policy III, which has shallower discounts. However, these deeper discounts lead to a reduction in revenue due to the pronounced increase in actual discounts used.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">These aggregate trends, while significant, mask significant heterogeneity across customers. To assess the potential impact of AI-powered personalization, we split the customer base into segments based on their price sensitivity and analyzed the response across segments. We found that for more price-sensitive customers, the effect of discounts on revenue was muted, which we attribute to these customers having a lower overall propensity to purchase products. For this most price-sensitive segment, there was a slight decrease in revenue moving from III to IV, attributable to the sharp increase in realized discounts. For higher-spending, less price-sensitive customers, the opposite was true, where policy III produced more revenue than IV. So for revenue optimization, it is clear that there is potential uplift from personalizing the discounting policies, e.g. by issuing targeted coupons. For retention and category penetration, there are also differences across segments, with the larger discounts having a more positive impact on the price-sensitive customers which is apparent when comparing policies II with III, IV, and V. These results fit well with the intuition that a retailer can "buy" growth by offering lower prices. The inherent trade-off between growth and profitability underscores the potential of AI, especially RL methods that account for long-term effects, as a powerful tool for retailers. We have shown here that RetailSynth can capture short-term and long-term dynamics and generate differential responses across segments, which gives us the confidence to deploy it for AI systems evaluation tasks.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">RetailSynth is designed to generate synthetic retail datasets for evaluating AI systems, which dynamically adjust the marketing mix (price, promotion, product, and place) over time with the aim of maximizing customer lifetime value. As AI systems mature, we expect increasing emphasis on price and promotion, both as decision variables and as key modeling inputs. Given this context, we carefully incorporated price sensitivity into our model so that it systematically varies across customers and products. We also valued scalability, designing RetailSynth to be embarrassingly parallel to run, with each customer and product category being independent. We made many strongly opinionated design decisions, and so we feel it is valuable to compare RetailSynth to existing solutions. To facilitate this comparison, we choose the following evaluation criteria:</p>

<p id="S5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">RetailSynth fulfills criteria 1, 2, and 4, while neglecting 3, due to the aforementioned scalability concerns. In Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5 Discussion ‣ RetailSynth: Synthetic Data Generation for Retail AI Systems Evaluation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we show how RetailSynth compares to other recent models and simulation frameworks. Importantly, none of the included models or frameworks meet all the design criteria, which we attribute to the scale and complexity of the modeling problem at hand and also to the evolving objectives of retail AI systems. For classical product recommendation systems or one-time product promotions, the outcome variable of interest is indeed the binary record of product choices per shopping trip, and we see the majority of recent papers focusing on this target variable. It is the change of objective from the more narrow problem of product recommendation or coupon targeting to the more broadly defined customer lifetime value maximization that requires modeling the complete purchase record over time. Our framework can serve as a strong baseline method for building retail AI simulation environments as it captures the relevant outcome variables and models key decision variables. There is, however, room to improve our model’s ability to capture item-to-item interactions. We anticipate building on an existing sequential model, such as SHOPPER or directly modeling product bundles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. However, as Athey and coworkers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> noted, modeling item-to-item interactions suffers from the curse of dimensionality and so any such model will require significantly greater computational resources and may be more limited in scale than RetailSynth but more applicable to certain domains. Another area ripe for improvement is accurately capturing the effects of pricing decisions themselves. Our model leverages utility theory to model price sensitivity, but, with a large amount of diverse, training data, a deep learning model could almost certainly learn better the complex multivariate relationships inherent to retail customer decision-making <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Looking ahead, our focus is on evolving RetailSynth to simulate a broader range of business conditions. We are especially interested in incorporating dynamic customer preferences to make the modeling process more accurate and useful to retail managers. This would allow simulations to capture any feedback effects from AI-driven marketing mix decisions. As we adapt RetailSynth for additional use cases, we expect to build adapters to existing algorithms and to create use-case specific model configurations introducing the relevant decision variables. Our overarching ambition for RetailSynth is to showcase the broad potential of retail AI systems, inspiring increased experimentation in production settings and community collaboration on the development of simulation environments.</p>
