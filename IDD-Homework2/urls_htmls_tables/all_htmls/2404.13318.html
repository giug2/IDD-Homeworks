<p id="id24.id1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we provide solutions to two practical yet overlooked scenarios in federated learning for electronic health records (EHRs): firstly, we introduce EHRFL, a framework that facilitates federated learning across healthcare institutions with distinct medical coding systems and database schemas using text-based linearization of EHRs.
Secondly, we focus on a scenario where a single healthcare institution initiates federated learning to build a model tailored for itself, in which the number of clients must be optimized in order to reduce expenses incurred by the host. For selecting participating clients, we present a novel precision-based method, leveraging data latents to identify suitable participants for the institution.
Our empirical results show that EHRFL effectively enables federated learning across hospitals with different EHR systems.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate the efficacy of our precision-based method in selecting
reduced number of participating clients without compromising model performance, resulting in lower operational costs when constructing institution-specific models.
We believe this work lays a foundation for the broader adoption of federated learning on EHRs.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Code is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ji-youn-kim/EHRFL" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/ji-youn-kim/EHRFL</a></span></span></span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the contemporary healthcare environment, there is an exponential accumulation of electronic health records (EHRs), driven by daily patient interactions and clinical activities.
Models leveraging extensive longitudinal EHRs demonstrate enhanced capability for accurate prediction of patient status across a variety of predictive tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rajkomar et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Amirahmadi et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the evolving landscape of machine learning, there is a growing necessity for models to be trained on extensive data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Choi et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Yang et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, making it insufficient to solely utilize data from a single medical institution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Dash et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
Traditional approaches for modeling across multiple datasets have relied on centralized learning, wherein raw data is aggregated in a central repository for the purpose of model training.
However, the constraints imposed by patient privacy concerns through data aggregation preclude the feasibility of centralized learning, thereby underscoring the imperative for federated learning in healthcare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rieke et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Rahman et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is a decentralized training method that collaboratively updates a global model through the integration of locally trained models.
This approach circumvents the need for central data storage inherent in traditional centralized training by only sharing model weights instead.
The method facilitates the harness of rich, diverse data while concurrently adhering to strict compliance with data privacy norms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, two realistic yet overlooked scenarios exist in the context of EHR federated learning, which we address and provide solutions for.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The first scenario pertains to federated learning on heterogeneous EHR systems.
Specifically, different healthcare providers utilize disparate medical code systems (i.e., ICD-9, ICD-10) and different database schemas for storing patient data.
To enable federated learning across distinct EHRs, it is necessary to integrate these disparate code systems and schemas into a unified format for compatible modeling.
While one potential solution involves converting each EHR system into a Common Data Model (CDM) format <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rajkomar et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, this approach has been unexplored in prior federated learning studies due to the time-consuming and costly nature of constructing CDMs.
Instead, existing EHR federated learning research predominantly focus on establishing experimental setups within homogeneous client settings by partitioning data within the same hospital or database <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee and Shin, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Vaid et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Dang et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Rajendran et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
However, such an approach does not accurately emulate real-world scenarios of federated learning applied across hospitals, which often have different medical coding systems and database schemas.
This necessitates a framework for federated learning on heterogeneous EHRs.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 2: </span>Visualization of our precision-based method for selecting participating clients.

(Middle) The host computes precision (and recall) of each subject.
(Right) Based on the precision score (Pr), the host selects federated learning participants by excluding clients with low precision values.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The second scenario centers on a potentially practical situation where a single healthcare institution initiates federated learning to develop a model tailored specifically for its own use.
In contrast to existing federated learning research which predominantly focus on collaboratively creating a global model for multiple clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wen et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, one conceivable scenario involves a hospital assembling clients to engage in federated learning aimed at creating a model for itself.
This approach incurs costs for the host (i.e., initiating institution), including compensations for clients’ participation (i.e., data usage payments) and the construction of a network infrastructure to facilitate the involvement of multiple participants.
As the number of clients increase, so do the costs incurred by the host, including data usage payments to each client and infrastructure development <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Majeed et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. This underscores the importance of optimizing the number of participating clients to reduce expenses.
Furthermore, the inclusion of certain clients may not affect, or could potentially degrade, the model’s performance from the perspective of the host institution.
Thus, in order to eliminate unnecessary costs for the host, it is crucial to identify and exclude such clients from the federated process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As a solution for the first scenario, we incorporate the methodology of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hur et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> into federated learning, and propose a Federated Learning framework for heterogeneous Electronic Health Records (EHRFL).
In their study, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hur et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> introduced a method for EHR modeling that addresses the issue of code and database schema heterogeneity of EHRs.
The method involves converting medical codes and schemas into a unified text-based representation, facilitating EHR modeling of distinct healthcare systems.
However, their focus was exclusively on centralized learning, which encounter significant limitations in practical application due to patient privacy concerns as mentioned above.
By integrating the method into federated learning, our framework eliminates the requirement for intricate mapping of medical codes and database schemas, thereby facilitating collaborative federated learning across different EHR systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To address the second scenario, we propose a precision-based method to exclude participating clients that either negligibly contribute to or negatively affect federated learning performance in the perspective of a single healthcare institution, for cost reduction incurred by the host.
Recently, in the domain of computer vision, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kynkäänniemi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> proposed a method for assessing the quality of generated images in relation to the original image by using precision and recall of generated and original image latents.
Inspired by this method, we adapt it to the federated learning domain to measure data similarities between clients by utilizing data latents.
With our proposed precision-based approach, the host eliminates clients with low precision scores among all candidate clients for federated learning participation, thereby reducing the number of participating clients while maintaining model performance for the host.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Through extensive experiments on multiple open-source datasets with different medical codes and schemas, we show that our EHRFL framework, for the first time, enables federated learning across hospitals with varying medical codes and schemas.
Furthermore, our experiments reveal that there is correlation between latent-based precision scores and performance difference between the host performance on federated learning and that of the single-source model trained exclusively on the host’s data.
This relationship is consistently observed across various cohort sizes settings.
Additionally, applying our precision-based method for selecting clients involved in federated learning can enable the participation of fewer clients without performance trade-off, which leads to reduced operational costs.
We believe our work establishes foundational groundwork for the widespread application in multiple scenarios of federated learning on electronic health records.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Generalizable Insights about Machine Learning in the Context of Healthcare</h3>

<div id="S1.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In healthcare, the diversity in medical code systems and database schemas among different hospitals poses a significant challenge for federated learning.
While previous research often construct clients within homogeneous datasets or databases, such approaches do not capture the complexities of real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the EHRFL framework, which enables federated learning across diverse EHR systems by leveraging text-based linearization of EHRs.
Our empirical evaluations demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, the efficacy and practicality of federated learning on heterogeneous EHR systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, in practical healthcare scenarios, healthcare institutions may seek to develop a model tailored for its own use. However, more clients involved in the federated learning process inevitably leads to increased costs.
Thus, there is a critical need for strategies that minimize client involvement, without model performance trade-off.
To address this challenge, we present a novel precision-based method for selecting participating clients.
Our experimental analysis confirms the viability of reducing participant numbers while sustaining model performance, particularly when suitable clients are selected.
Furthermore, our results highlight the efficacy of our precision-based approach compared to various baselines, validating that our method can effectively reduce the number of participating clients while preserving the performance level that can be achieved when all clients are involved.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning on EHRs</span>
In recent years, EHR federated learning has been extensively explored, primarily due to its capability to utilize data from multiple institutions without directly sharing patient data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee and Shin, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Vaid et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Dang et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Rajendran et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>.
These studies perform various predictive tasks on open-source datasets such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Johnson et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>); Pollard et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> or that of proprietary EHR systems.
However, a common limitation of existing studies lies in the oversimplified construction of clients, often achieved by partitioning a single dataset or database into multiple clients to simulate a federated learning setting. This simplification is primarily attributed to the challenges associated with addressing code and schema heterogeneity across diverse datasets, leading to a disparity between experimental settings and practical scenarios.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Client Distance Measurement in Federated Learning</span>
Aligned yet distinct from our objectives, there exists prior research on measuring distances between clients in the context of federated learning.
For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Huang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Elhussein and Gürsoy (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> have introduced clustered federated learning methods for grouping clients based on similarity, enabling the training of distinct models for each cluster.
Specifically, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Huang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> implemented K-means clustering (euclidean distance-based) on patient representation vectors from each client, derived from a common pre-trained autoencoder model.
Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Elhussein and Gürsoy (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> employed cosine similarity to create matrices that represent client similarities, using patient representation vectors extracted in the same manner.
Unlike these approaches, our work introduces a precision-based method to compute the distance between clients, aiming to identify clients for exclusion when building a model for a single host.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we conduct three experiments.
The first experiment focuses on federated learning across multiple medical institutions with differing medical codes and database schemas.
This experiment aims to assess the efficacy of EHRFL when conducting federated learning on heterogeneous EHR systems.
The second experiment investigates the relationship between precision and model performance difference across diverse host-subject pairs.
Here, model performance difference refers to the difference in host performance when performing federated learning with a subject involved, compared to the performance of a single-source model built solely upon the host’s data.
Positive correlation between precision and model performance difference would justify the exclusion of clients with low precision scores to prevent negligible or adverse impact on model performance.
Building upon the findings obtained in the second experiment, the third experiment applies the precision-based method to the first experiment, for identifying clients to exclude from the federated learning process, in the perspective of each host.
The ultimate goal is to eliminate unnecessary costs for the host by reducing the number of participating clients without compromising the model’s performance.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For our experiments, we utilize three open-sourced EHR datasets: MIMIC-III <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Johnson et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, MIMIC-IV <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Johnson et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and eICU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pollard et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, which all consist of patient ICU data.
MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV are derived from the same medical institution but cover different time periods and differ in database schemas (MIMIC-III spans 2001-2012, MIMIC-IV covers 2008-2019).
The eICU dataset includes data from multiple hospitals across the United States.
To accommodate the differences in database systems within MIMIC-III (CareVue and MetaVision databases), we split it into two separate clients: MIMIC-III-CV (CareVue) and MIMIC-III-MV (MetaVision).
This division is necessitated by the variations in their schemas and the distinct periods covered by each system (CareVue from 2001-2008 and MetaVision from 2009-2012).
For MIMIC-IV, we exclude data from the overlapping period of 2008-2012 with MIMIC-III, in order to ensure no temporal overlap between the two datasets.
Given the relatively small size of each hospital data within eICU dataset compared to MIMIC, we constructed two clients to reflect geological heterogeneity: eICU-South and eICU-West.
This division ensures that there is no geographical overlap with the MIMIC datasets, which originate from the Northeast region.
To summarize, we construct a total of 5 clients from 4 different EHR database systems across 3 different geographical regions, featuring heterogeneous demographics and label distributions, listed in <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\appendixref</span>apd:stat.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the federated learning results using our EHRFL framework, incorporating five distinct clients with heterogeneous EHRs, specifically MIMIC-III-CV, MIMIC-III-MV, MIMIC-IV, eICU-South, and eICU-West mentioned above.
To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first to enable federated learning with clients of distinct medical codes and EHR database schemas.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.2" class="ltx_p">tab:full shows the average macro AUROC results across 12 clinical tasks on three distinct scenarios: federated learning on our EHRFL framework, single-source modeling trained on each client’s data, and centralized learning with aggregated data from all clients.
We include single-source and centralized training results for comparison with our EHRFL outcomes.
Single-source training results indicate the performance attainable from solely training on an individual client’s data, considered as a lower-bound.
Conversely, centralized learning shows the results achievable by training on aggregated data across multiple data sources, representing an optimal scenario.
Each client’s dataset is partitioned into train, validation, and test sets in an 8:1:1 ratio.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The results show that the federated learning performance for each client is either comparable to or higher than single-source results.
In cases where federated learning performance is comparable but not higher than single-source performance (i.e., MIMIC-III-CV, MIMIC-IV), the results underscore the ongoing challenge of addressing the non-IID problem in existing current federated learning algorithms (e.g., FedProx, FedBN, FedPxN), despite their focus on mitigating the non-IID issue, particularly when compared to the centralized learning performance.
However, notably, the federated learning performance higher than that of single-source modeling for certain clients (i.e., MIMIC-III-MV, eICU-South, and eICU-West) highlights the capability of our framework to facilitate collaborative learning across data sources of heterogeneous EHR systems.
These results provide the first empirical evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of federated learning across heterogeneous EHR systems.</p>

Subsequently, we refer to this difference as <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">performance delta</span>.
If a positive correlation exists between the two, it would provide grounds for excluding clients with low precision scores, who may otherwise negligibly or negatively impact model performance.

Additionally, the correlation between recall and performance delta averages to 0.168 (standard deviation 0.146) for Spearman’s rank and 0.118 (standard deviation 0.097) for Kendall’s tau.
The correlations for precision were high and consistent, while correlations for recall were relatively low and showed higher standard deviations.
The correlation levels for precision indicate a positive relationship between precision and performance delta in the two-client federated learning settings.
We additionally measured the correlation in multiple client federated learning scenarios, in order to confirm the relevance of precision and performance not only in two-client settings but also in multiple client settings.

<div id="S5.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed earlier, increased number of clients in federated learning incurs elevated costs for the host.
Therefore, it is crucial to optimize client participation by excluding clients that may potentially contribute minimally or detrimentally to the host’s performance.
In this section, we investigate the feasibility of maintaining federated learning performance with fewer participating clients, specifically when appropriate clients are selected.
Furthermore, we employ our precision-based method for selecting participating clients, and compare it’s efficacy against other baseline metrics of measuring client distance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<span id="S5.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\tableref</span>
<p id="S5.SS5.p2.2" class="ltx_p">tab:baselines presents the federated learning results for each host based on the total number of participating clients, with clients selected using our precision-based method and other baseline metrics (i.e., cosine similarity, euclidean distance, and KL-divergence).
Cosine similarity and euclidean distance are computed as the averaged patient-wise similarity and distance using the host and subject patient latent vectors, aligned to that of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Elhussein and Gürsoy (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Huang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, respectively.
KL-divergence is measured between the softmax-normalized latent vectors of the host and subject.
When selecting participating clients, we exclude the top clients with lowest precision scores for precision-based selection and the top clients with furthest distance values for the other baseline metrics respectively.
Additionally, we perform federated learning across all possible client combinations, and present the <span id="S5.SS5.p2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">random</span> and <span id="S5.SS5.p2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">best</span> performance.

The precision scores for each host-subject pair are depicted in <span id="S5.SS5.p2.2.5" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\figureref</span>fig:precision_scores.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The results show that in 14 out of 15 cases (across 3 client count settings with 5 clients each), the <span id="S5.SS5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">best</span> performance with reduced number of participating clients aligns with that of when all clients are involved (i.e., 5-client performance).
Such results demonstrate that in some cases, reducing the number of participants without compromising model performance is possible, which underscores the need for selecting participating clients.
Notably, among the 14 cases where <span id="S5.SS5.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">best</span> performance aligns with the full client participation performance, there are 11 cases in which the <span id="S5.SS5.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">random</span> performance is lower than and does not align with the full client performance.
Such results highlights the importance of carefully selecting suitable clients for the host.</p>

<div id="S5.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In evaluating the number of cases where client-selected performance aligns with the <span id="S5.SS5.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">best</span> performance, the results from employing precision, cosine similarity, euclidean distance, and KL-divergence for selection each results in 9, 3, 6, and 5 aligned cases respectively.
This indicates that our precision-based method outperforms other baseline metrics in aligning with the upper-bound performance, highlighting the efficacy of our method in selecting appropriate participating clients for the host.
Furthermore, when selecting participating clients with our precision-based method, 14 out of 15 cases achieve equal or higher performance compared to the full client participation performance.
Such results suggests that our precision-based method can maintain the performance achieved with full client engagement while reducing the number of participating clients.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we provide solutions to two realistic yet underexplored scenarios in EHR federated learning.
We first introduce the Electronic Health Record Federated Learning framework (EHRFL), which facilitates federated learning across healthcare institutions with heterogeneous electronic health record systems by utilizing text-based EHR linearization.
Furthermore, we propose a novel precision-based method, which leverages data latents to select participating clients by identifying clients to exclude, in the perspective of a single healthcare institution.
Our experiment results demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility and effectiveness of federated learning on distinct EHR systems by using our EHRFL framework.
Additionally, we empirically show that in some cases maintaining federated learning performance with fewer participating clients is possible, particularly when suitable clients for the host are selected, highlighting the necessity of selecting participating clients.
Furthermore, our experiments validate the efficacy of our precision-based method in identifying and excluding non-ideal clients, thereby optimizing the number of participants without compromising model performance for the host.
We believe this research provides a foundation for expanding the practical implementation of federated learning in healthcare.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Limitations</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although our EHRFL framework demonstrates performance improvements in federated learning compared to single-source models, we do not directly compare our results with those obtained through federated learning after mapping to a standardized format such as Common Data Model (CDM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rajkomar et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Biedermann et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. CDMs utilize predefined schemas and medical terminologies to store EHRs from various healthcare institutions in a unified format. While the conversion of EHRs into CDM format can be labor-intensive and costly, future research can provide insights in how our framework, without schema and code mapping, compares in performance to those using standardized formats such as CDMs for federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While our experimental findings underscore the efficacy of our precision-based method in optimizing client participation through selective exclusion, determining the optimal number of participating clients remains an area of further study.
We believe that identifying the optimal client count can further enhance the applicability of our method in federated learning for EHRs.</p>

<p id="A4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We measure the correlation between precision and performance difference across multiple client federated learning scenarios.
We use the clients constructed in <span id="A4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\sectionref</span>exp:prec_corr, which are characterized by varying sizes (i.e., 4k, 8k, 12k, and 16k), and varying data sources (i.e., MIMIC-III-CV, MIMIC-III-MV, MIMIC-IV, eICU-South, eICU-West).
We experiment in a five-client setting, with each experiment consisting clients of identical sizes (either 4k, 8k, 12k, 16k).
The core to this analysis is to compute the correlation between the precision of a given host-subject pair and the observed change in performance.
This performance change is quantified as the difference in federated learning performance when engaging five clients in comparison to the results achieved with four clients, the latter scenario excluding the considered subject.
<span id="A4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\figureref</span>exp:multi_client shows the relationship between the precision associated with each subject and the observed performance drop from the perspective of each host.
Across the four plots, consistent correlations were observed, averaging 0.339 (standard deviation 0.073) for Spearman’s rank, and 0.223 (standard deviation 0.057) for Kendall’s tau.
Such results indicate a positive correlation between precision and performance increase, not only in two-client settings but also across multiple client settings.</p>

<p id="A5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The results show that in 8 out of 15 cases (across 3 client count settings with 5 clients each), the <span id="A5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">best</span> performance with reduced number of participating clients aligns with that of when all clients are involved (i.e., 5-client performance).
Such results demonstrate that in some cases, reducing the number of participants without compromising model performance is possible, which underscores the need for selecting participating clients.
Notably, among the 8 cases where <span id="A5.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">best</span> performance aligns with the full client participation performance, there are 5 cases in which the <span id="A5.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">random</span> performance is lower than and does not align with the full client performance.
Such results highlights the importance of carefully selecting suitable clients for the host.</p>

<p id="A5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In evaluating the number of cases where client-selected performance aligns with the <span id="A5.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">best</span> performance, the results from employing precision, cosine similarity, euclidean distance, and KL-divergence for selection each results in 5, 4, 3 and 2 aligned cases respectively.
This indicates that our precision-based method outperforms other baseline metrics in aligning with the upper-bound performance, highlighting the efficacy of our method in selecting appropriate participating clients for the host.
Furthermore, when selecting participating clients with our precision-based method, 6 out of 15 cases achieve equal or higher performance compared to the full client participation performance.
Such results suggests that our precision-based method can maintain the performance achieved with full client engagement while reducing the number of participating clients.</p>
