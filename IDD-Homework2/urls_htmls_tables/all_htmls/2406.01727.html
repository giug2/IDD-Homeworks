<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for collaborative wideband spectrum sensing and scheduling for networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which act as the secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically utilize detected “spectrum holes”. Our overall framework consists of three main stages. Firstly, in the <em id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model training</em> stage, we explore dataset generation in a multi-cell environment and training a machine learning (ML) model using the federated learning (FL) architecture. Unlike the existing studies on FL for wireless that presume datasets are readily available for training, we propose a novel architecture that directly integrates wireless dataset generation, which involves capturing I/Q samples from over-the-air signals in a multi-cell environment, into the FL training process. To this purpose, we propose a multi-label classification problem for wideband spectrum sensing to detect multiple spectrum holes simultaneously based on the I/Q samples collected locally by the UAVs. In the traditional FL that employ FedAvg as the aggregating method, each UAV is assigned an equal weight during model aggregation. However, due to the disparities in channel conditions in a multi-cell environment, the FedAvg approach may not generalize effectively for all the UAV locations. To address this issue, we propose a proportional weighted federated averaging method (pwFedAvg) in which the aggregating weights incorporate wireless channel conditions and received signal powers at each individual UAV. As such, the proposed method integrates the intrinsic properties of wireless datasets into the FL algorithm.
Secondly, in the <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">collaborative spectrum inference</em> stage, we propose a collaborative spectrum fusion strategy that is compatible with the unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) ecosystem.
In particular, we improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing results by combining the individual multi-label classification results from the individual UAVs at a central server. Finally, in the <em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">spectrum scheduling</em> stage, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to dynamically allocate the detected spectrum holes to the secondary users. To evaluate the proposed methods, we establish a comprehensive simulation framework that generates a near-realistic synthetic dataset using MATLAB LTE toolbox by incorporating base-station (BS) locations in a chosen area of interest, performing ray-tracing, and emulating the primary users channel usage in terms of I/Q samples. This evaluation methodology provides a flexible framework to generate <em id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">large spectrum datasets</em> that could be used for developing ML/AI-based spectrum management solutions for aerial devices.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted significant interest from communications and networking, robotics, and control societies for exploring novel applications such as on-demand connectivity, search-and-rescue operations, situational awareness, to name a few <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. As of April 2024, there were roughly 800,000 registered UAVs in the US alone, positioning UAVs as one of the fastest-growing sectors in the aviation industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Traditionally, UAVs that are used for recreational purposes are operated under visual line of sight (VLOS) conditions. However, real-world and commercial deployments will most likely be in the form of beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS), which provides easier access to remote or hazardous areas, less human intervention, and reduced cost of operation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. For safe operations of multiple UAVs under BVLOS conditions, NASA and FAA are in the process of defining the UTM system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Learning-based Collaborative Wideband Spectrum Sensing and Scheduling for UAVs in UTM Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows a simplified form of the UTM architecture, highlighting the separation between FAA and industry development and deployment responsibilities for the necessary infrastructure, services, and entities that interact within the UTM ecosystem. In this work, we mainly focus on the hierarchical structure between multiple operators and the UAS service supplier (USS), which assists multiple operators in meeting UTM operational requirements, ensuring safe and efficient utilization of the airspace.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The concept of operations within the UTM architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> highlights the need for spectrum resources to facilitate wireless communications between UAVs, UAV operators, and the USS network.
Existing terrestrial mobile networks (for example, 4G LTE and the upcoming 5G-and-beyond) provide significant wireless coverage with relatively low latency, high throughput, and low cost, making the cellular network a good candidate for the operation of UAVs in BVLOS scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However, the proliferation of new wireless services and the demand for higher cellular data rates have significantly exacerbated the spectrum crunch that cellular providers are already experiencing.
Therefore, it is essential to develop dynamic spectrum sensing, inference, and sharing solutions for UAV operations in existing licensed and unlicensed spectrum to enable advanced aerial use cases in BVLOS, such as urban air mobility (UAM) and advanced air mobility (AAM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There exists a multitude of prior works on spectrum management frameworks for ground users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. For instance, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> propose deep learning-based wideband spectrum sensing to dynamically detect “spectrum holes”. Furthermore, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> propose reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for spectrum sharing, assuming that spectrum sensing results are readily available. While these data-driven spectrum management frameworks for ground users are available, they are not directly applicable for UTM-enabled UAV operations, due to several factors, such as the widely different wireless channel models and the overall system architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
In the context of UAV spectrum sharing systems, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed spatial spectral sensing (SSS) to develop efficient spectrum sharing policies for UAV communications aimed at improving the overall spectral efficiency (SE). However, the SSS models do not consider the spectrum usage pattern of users under realistic scenarios (e.g., ignoring the I/Q level samples), and/or they consider only a single primary user (PU) or secondary user (SU). Moreover, the problem of joint multi-channel wideband spectrum sensing and scheduling among several SUs has not been fully investigated.
In this paper, we propose a unified and data-driven spectrum sensing and scheduling framework to enable UAVs to effectively share the spectrum with existing primary users.
To make our development more concrete and grounded, the problem of joint spectrum sensing and sharing is formulated as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization in a wideband multi-UAV network scenario. Then, we transform the EE optimization problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize the overall throughput of the SUs. At the spectrum sensing stage, we note the inherent hierarchical nature of the UTM architecture with USS (shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Learning-based Collaborative Wideband Spectrum Sensing and Scheduling for UAVs in UTM Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) is a good match for federated learning (FL) based spectrum sensing. For spectrum scheduling stage, we develop RL-based solutions to enable non-manual and automated spectrum resource allocation.
Particular to the spectrum sensing stage, we propose an FL-based cooperative wideband spectrum sensing across multiple UAVs. To this purpose, we develop a multi-label classification framework to identify spectrum holes based on the observed I/Q samples. Each UAV trains their respective local models using the locally collected datasets and transmits the local model parameters to the central server. Furthermore, we propose a novel proportional
weighted federated averaging (pwFedAvg) method that incorporates the power level received at each UAV into the FL aggregation algorithm, thereby integrating the dataset generation plane with the FL model training plane, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Learning-based Collaborative Wideband Spectrum Sensing and Scheduling for UAVs in UTM Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Once the training process is completed, all UAVs have an updated global model that predicts <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">spectrum holes</em>.
To further enhance the accuracy of the individual spectrum inference results, the predicted spectrum holes from the multi-label classification at each UAV are fused at a central server within the UTM ecosystem. In the spectrum scheduling stage, we develop and implement several RL algorithms, including the standard Q-learning methods to dynamically allocate underutilized spectrum sub-channels to multiple UAVs. We further investigate the performance of the “vanilla” deep Q-Network (DQN) and its variations, including double DQN (DDQN) and DDQN with soft-update.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, one of the primary challenges of using machine learning (ML) based methods for spectrum sensing and scheduling approaches is the need for large amounts of training data. The lack of available spectral data in many cases is a significant obstacle, especially for UAV networks that introduce an additional level of complexity for large-scale experimental data collection. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive framework for generating spectrum datasets. This framework models LTE waveform generation and propagation channel in any environment of interest, particularly suitable for UTM-enabled UAV applications. Using the generated dataset, we provide a comprehensive set of numerical results to demonstrate the efficacy of the joint FL-based spectrum sensing, spectrum fusion and RL-based dynamic spectrum allocation to multiple UAVs.

the licensed channels that are occupied by the D2D communications of ground users. The UAVs perform SSS to obtain the received signal strength and compare it with a threshold to identify the spectrum occupancy of a particular D2D channel.
However, in general, energy-based detection methods would require capturing the entire waveform for a sub-channel to compute the energy and compare it with a predefined threshold. When there are multiple sub-channels, such detection methods repeated for each sub-channel add further time and hardware complexity.

However, the studies only considered a single PU with multiple SUs within the coverage of the PU. There exists a separate class of research that concentrate on interference management in a multi-cell wireless networks and incorporate over-the-air computation in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. For instance, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> study the adverse effects of inter-cell interference on the uplink and downlink local model aggregates and global model updates and propose solutions to mitigate the interference. In contrast to the above mentioned works, in this paper, we cater for multiple PUs, multiple SUs, incorporate co-channel interference at the dataset generation level, and also consider wideband spectrum sensing.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, there exists few research works on FL for wireless systems that investigate how the convergence of the learning process is affected by the noisy transmissions between the clients and the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. However, these investigations often assume that the datasets are readily available at the clients and primarily focus on the specific discussions of model training plane, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Learning-based Collaborative Wideband Spectrum Sensing and Scheduling for UAVs in UTM Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Yet, wireless datasets collected by multiple UAVs in a multi-cell environment are significantly complex and different compared to those standard datasets. For instance, data collected at one UAV location may encounter distinct wireless channels, varying numbers of propagation paths, and significantly different received signal power levels compared to the data collected at other locations. This variability underscores the need for tailored approaches to the model training within FL frameworks, particularly when dealing with datasets from real-world wireless environments. Hence, we propose a weighted averaging algorithm (pwFedAvg) that captures the disparities in the datasets captured at different UAV locations. Moreover, none of the previous works considered training the FL models with I/Q datasets. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture to capture wireless datasets in a multi-cell environment, and integrate the dataset generation and the model training planes, to incorporate the effects of wireless datasets into the FL model training, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Learning-based Collaborative Wideband Spectrum Sensing and Scheduling for UAVs in UTM Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

In this paper, we focus on three main stages to develop our proposed framework: (i) FL-based training for wideband spectrum sensing, (ii) collaborative spectrum inference and fusion, and (iii) spectrum scheduling. To coordinate the above three stages, we assume a central server within the UTM ecosystem. Next, we describe these stages.</p>

Such a hierarchical architecture makes it feasible to implement FL-based learning algorithms to identify spectrum holes. In this case, we may consider two deployment models within the UTM architecture. One model would be to have a server deployed by each UAV operator where multiple UAVs connected to the operator act as FL clients. The second model would have a server within the USS network that orchestrates multiple UAV operators.
Thus, with several UAVs training local models, they exchange model parameters with the central server that is located either at the USS or UAV operator. The central server then aggregates the local model weights according to an aggregation algorithm and transmits the global model weights back to the UAVs to update their local models.

However, in our considered multi-cell environment, the signal received at different UAV locations experiences different channel conditions, and the signal power received at different locations varies significantly. Hence, by assigning equal scaling weights for the local model gradients, the performance metrics at UAV locations with strong signal deteriorate. To compensate for this effect and improve performance at locations that receive better signal power, we propose a proportional weight scaling aggregation method for FL (pwFedAvg) that intuitively assigns smaller weights to UAVs with lower received signal power (i.e., poor channel conditions), and larger weights to those UAVs with higher received signal power.</p>

To solve an MDP using RL, an agent learns to make decisions in an uncertain environment by maximizing a cumulative reward over a sequence of actions. Specifically, the agent interacts with an environment by taking actions that transition the system from one state to another, and the agent receives a reward that is commensurate with the merit of the action. The discount factor determines the relative importance of immediate and future rewards.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Utilizing data-driven machine learning techniques for wide-band spectrum sensing requires substantial amounts of spectrum data. While obtaining raw I/Q signals over the air using physical hardware is the ideal scenario, the complexity of coordinating multiple UAVs in a specific environment for collaborative sensing poses significant challenges in achieving this objective.
Therefore, we resort to MATLAB’s LTE toolbox to create the I/Q samples and employ ray-tracing methods to emulate the channel for generating synthetic datasets that closely mimic the data collection process through experimentation. The entire process of generating synthetic datasets is outlined below.</p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another important aspect in any wireless network is the wireless channel modeling. We use ray-tracing methods to incorporate the channel between the BS and the UAV. We incorporate both reflection and diffraction settings in ray-tracing to simulate a near real-world environment. This is in contrast to using channel models, which consider probabilistic channel models for line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS channel conditions. Since we use ray-tracing, we have the flexibility to incorporate different aspects of the environment like buildings and vegetation, permittivity and permeability of the materials, which further enhances the channel model.</p>

Typically, a base-station has the flexibility to assign either a single sub-channel or multiple sub-channels to a PU for transmitting user-specific data on the downlink shared channel. Additionally, various multiple access techniques can be employed to transmit data to different PUs in different time slots. However, during our dataset generation process, we do not consider primary user locations and how the base-station allocates user specific data to different PUs. At any given point in time, we take a snapshot of the entire cell bandwidth and identify which spectrum bands are occupied. Furthermore, when creating the downlink waveform, we omit the generation of UE specific reference signals to avoid mixing user-specific data with broadcast channels. Instead, we identify the appropriate indices and embed the LTE data samples into the downlink shared channel to generate the LTE waveform.</p>

As mentioned earlier, detecting spectrum holes aligns with the framework of a classical multi-label classification problem, where each sub-channel represents a label. We utilize Precision, Recall, and F1-score as metrics to evaluate the classifier’s performance for each sub-channel by constructing a confusion matrix. Although we can calculate these performance metrics for each sub-channel individually, it would be advantageous to have an average performance assessment across all <math id="S7.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="16" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">16</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1">16</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1c">16</annotation></semantics></math> sub-channels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.

This is one of the key observations that led us to explore federated learning that combines the advantages of both LL and CL to obtain a more generalized global model, without the need to accumulate all the datasets in one central location.</p>

In Fig. <a href="#S7.F18.sf1" title="In Figure 18 ‣ VII-A Model Training with Distributed UAVs ‣ VII Numerical Results ‣ Federated Learning-based Collaborative Wideband Spectrum Sensing and Scheduling for UAVs in UTM Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18a</span></a>, we compare the training performance of three variants of Q-learning methods for allocating a sub-channel to a single UAV whenever the fusion rule detects at least a single spectrum hole. It is observed that DDQN with soft update performs slightly better and converges earlier than DDQN and vanilla-DQN.
Next, we extend the model to allocate spectrum holes to two UAVs. In this case, we have augmented the DDQN algorithm with soft update to generate two best actions. From the results in Fig. <a href="#S7.F18.sf2" title="In Figure 18 ‣ VII-A Model Training with Distributed UAVs ‣ VII Numerical Results ‣ Federated Learning-based Collaborative Wideband Spectrum Sensing and Scheduling for UAVs in UTM Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18b</span></a>, we observe that the utility performance with two SUs is slightly less than two times of the performance with a single SU.

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we developed a collaborative wideband spectrum sensing and sharing solution for networked UAVs. To train machine learning models for detecting spectrum holes, we explored the applications of FL and developed an architecture that integrates wireless dataset generation into the FL model training and aggregation steps. To this end, we proposed the pwFedAvg algorithm to incorporate wireless channel conditions and received signal powers into the FL aggregation algorithm. To further enhance the accuracy of the predicted spectrum holes by individual UAVs, we considered spectrum fusion at the central server. Additionally, by leveraging deep Q-learning methods, the detected spectrum holes are dynamically allocated to the requesting UAVs. To evaluate the proposed methods, we generated a near-realistic synthetic dataset using MATLAB LTE toolbox by incorporating base-station locations in a chosen area of interest, performing ray-tracing, and emulating the primary users channel usage in terms of I/Q samples. Based on the collected I/Q datasets, we investigated the performance of three model training algorithms, namely CL, LL, and FL.
The numerical results demonstrated that the CL model generalizes well and performs better for all UAV locations, while the LL models showed poor generalization performance.
Furthermore, the proposed pwFedAvg algorithm outperforms FedAvg while achieving comparable results with respect to the CL method without the need for sharing all datasets to a central location. From the fusion results, we noticed that the overall performance improved significantly for all learning configurations, and the implemented DDQN method can provide dynamic spectrum scheduling across requesting UAVs. In future work, we plan to expand the application of our developed solutions to other technologies and spectrum bands (beyond LTE), while incorporating realistic spectrum usage of the incumbent users in those bands (i.e., PUs).
