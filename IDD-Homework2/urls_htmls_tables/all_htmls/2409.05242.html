<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Communication efficiency is a widely recognised research problem in Federated Learning (FL), with recent work focused on developing techniques for efficient compression, distribution and aggregation of model parameters between clients and the server.
Particularly within distributed systems, it is important to balance the need for computational cost and communication efficiency.
However, existing methods are often constrained to specific applications and are less generalisable. In this paper, we introduce <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> (federated frequency-space transformation), a simple yet effective methodology for communicating model parameters in a FL setting. <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to represent model parameters in frequency space, enabling efficient compression and reducing communication overhead. <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> is compatible with various existing FL methodologies and neural architectures, and its linear property eliminates the need for multiple transformations during federated aggregation.
This methodology is vital for distributed solutions, tackling essential challenges like data privacy, interoperability, and energy efficiency inherent to these environments.
We demonstrate the generalisability of the <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> methodology on four datasets using comparative studies with three state-of-the-art FL baselines (<span id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>, <span id="id1.id1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx</span>, <span id="id1.id1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSim</span>).
Our results demonstrate that using <span id="id1.id1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> to represent the differences in model parameters between communication rounds in frequency space results in a more compact representation compared to representing the entire model in frequency space.
This leads to a reduction in communication overhead, while keeping accuracy levels comparable and in some cases even improving it.
Our results suggest that this reduction can range from 5% to 30% per client, depending on dataset.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) plays a crucial role in advancing decentralised Artificial Intelligence (AI) training,
as it allows for the training of Machine Learning (ML) models on distributed clients (i.e. edge devices) without centralising sensitive data.
Training of ML models on client data without transferring them to a central server significantly reduces the risk of privacy violation and ensures better compliance with regulations such as the GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
FL seamlessly integrates with distributed systems, emphasising distributed processing and enhanced data privacy. This method trains machine learning models directly on edge devices, cutting down bandwidth needs and significantly improving privacy measures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
The prevalence of FL applications, such as voice assistants, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and mobile apps are rapidly increasing
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Other areas such as privacy-sensitive ML applications in healthcare for disease diagnosis and treatment are also ideal domains for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Another notable industry adapting FL is in finance, where models can be trained without shared access to private information for credit risk assessment and anti-fraud detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Central to FL is its distributed decentralised training of a shared global model with many communication exchanges between the server and its clients.
At each communication round, the shared model is updated by the server as an aggregation of client models received.
The FL communication layer needs to handle many requirements due to its iterative nature which involves frequent and large model exchanges.
Inefficient communication can slow down training, increase computational cost, decrease accuracy, raise energy consumption and limit scalability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Compression can be used to improve communication performance by reducing the amount of data being transmitted.
For instance, ML applications can optimise storage and inference speed by using transformation methods like Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), as demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
DCT operates by converting model parameters into the frequency domain, after which processes like quantisation and pruning can be applied to discard less significant coefficients.
This results in a more compact representation of the model with optimising both storage requirements and computational efficiency during inference.
In FL research, although the use of DCT has been acknowledged,
the main focus has been on using it to compress training data for better local representation on client devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
We use the term “tensor space” to distinguish the space in which model parameters are represented from that in which training data is represented.
The example in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FedFT: Improving Communication Performance for Federated Learning with Frequency Space Transformation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> compares model weight representation in tensor and frequency spaces. In the frequency space, the weights decomposed into their constituent frequencies are more spread out and concentrated to a few dominant frequency components, allowing for efficient representation and storage.</p>
</div>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One of the challenges facing FL using tensor space compression is ensuring that compression techniques do not obstruct server-side aggregation operations.
Most FL methods address this challenge by using lossless compression techniques and incorporate an extra step of reconstructing the tensor space at the server for model aggregation prior to compressing it again for transmission back to the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
What we propose in this paper is a methodology, <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span>, that enables server aggregation in the same compressed space.
To achieve this, we investigate the feasibility of using DCT-transformed model parameters in the communication layer of FL to enhance communication performance without sacrificing model accuracy.
The direct advantage of <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> is that it enables the sharing of model parameters in the frequency domain, and local client updates can be done in either the frequency space or tensor space, making it adaptable across different methodologies.
Furthermore, the compact representations in frequency space make it simple for clients to identify sparse areas that could be easily pruned before communicating them to the central server.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The exponential growth of edge devices and their applications, including the IoT, smart home assistants, mobile apps, and wearables, has led to a substantial increase in data creation at the edge of the network.
This increase of data (i.e. big data) offers considerable benefits for customisation and real-time analytics but also introduces significant risks to user privacy.
Accordingly, the demand for distributed machine learning strategies, FL and distributed computing architectures has intensified, becoming more crucial than ever.
In practical applications FL operates by training models on local data directly on client/edge devices, emphasising privacy and minimal data transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
In contrast, distributed architectures focus on processing data locally at the edge of the network first and if required communicate it to a central cloud for further processing.
The key similarity between FL and distributed computing lies in their reliance on local computation to reduce bandwidth usage.
Both strategies are designed to efficiently manage data where it is generated, thereby reducing network resources and enhancing communication efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<section id="S2.SS1" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Communication Efficient FL</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Communication cost is a primary bottleneck for FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
This is because FL requires high-frequent communication of model parameters between clients and the server, where the number of clients can be in the millions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
The size of these neural models can vary greatly, from a mere few kilobytes to several hundred megabytes depending on their complexity.
The communication bottleneck in FL systems can lead to unreliability and limit their ability to scale up and meet increasing demands.
In a realistic setting, there can be clients with poor network connections or with resource limitations which can further hinder the performance of the FL system.
Methodologies like <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> have addressed this issue to handle partial updates from clients having limited connectivity.
More generally, the approaches in literature aimed at mitigating this communication bottleneck can be studied under two groups: <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">structured updates</span> - where the local training and communication is done in a restricted space (e.g. restricted to a fewer number of model parameters); and <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sketched updates</span> - where the local update is performed on the complete model and compressed for communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, however, the efficiency of communication in updates performed through sketches is often more adaptable and can be easily integrated with existing FL techniques.
We employ the sketched update approach to enable local client updates to be performed in either tensor or compressed frequency space, with communication and federated aggregation performed in compressed frequency space.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Compression techniques of FL models in tensor space include sub sampling (which reduces spacial resolution) and probabilistic quantisation (which reduces precision) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
The aim of our work is closer to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, where they compress model parameters using Golomb Coding and reduce model complexity through quantisation.
Golomb Coding is a lossless compression technique, but its non-linear nature means that additional transformations must be performed at the server incurring extra reconstruction steps. This is because it cannot perform federated aggregation in the compressed space. Also, the quantisation is tightly coupled with the client local update making the work by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> less adaptable by existing FL methodologies.
Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.2 Compression for Communication Efficiency ‣ 2 Background and Related Work ‣ FedFT: Improving Communication Performance for Federated Learning with Frequency Space Transformation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrates applying a standard compression algorithm in FL.
This approach involves multiple stages of model compression and decompression to reduce the communication overhead between the server and the clients.
The increased computational demand can make the approach less practical, especially for resource-constrained environments or large-scale deployments with millions of clients.</p>

Specifically its orthogonality property is essential for compression and its linearity property enables federated aggregation on the frequency space.
Authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, also aim for communication efficiency
through lossless compression and quantisation, but they apply compression on the gradients rather than model parameters.

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Frequency space transformation techniques have been employed for data compression for many years, examples include DCT, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
However, DCT is one of the most widely used techniques due to its favourable properties such as computational efficiency and the ability to compactly represent the energy content of a signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
As a result DCT is widely adopted for image and video compression applications.
Data compression in the frequency space is accomplished by pruning (i.e. trimming) or quantising the least significant information.
In the field of ML, researchers have explored using the DCT for compressing models by transforming data into the frequency space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.
To the best of our knowledge, the full potential of DCT has not yet been fully exploited in the context of FL for the purpose of improving communication efficiency through model compression.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Pruning and quantisation are two methods used to optimise and simplify ML models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Pruning removes elements that carry less significant model parameters to reduce model size; a pruning mask can be learnt as part of model optimisation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>; alternatively, prior knowledge is used to identify pruning areas in static pruning.
Quantisation aims to decrease the precision of model parameters through the use of fewer bits, resulting in a smaller model size. Both techniques play a crucial role in ML models deployed in resource-constrained environments. Some quantisation techniques used in FL include FedPAQ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> using periodic averaging and FedPara <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> using low-rank Hadamard product parameterisation to reduce the precision of the model weights.
Authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> adopt a similar method to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> in FL to learn a pruning mask during client training which reduces the upstream communication cost. In contrast, a global and client model pruning is applied by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> using static pruning masks to reduce the overall communication cost. Their approach needs an extra step at the server where a single gradient descent step is taken on the global model.
<span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> utilises prior knowledge of pruning in the frequency space, eliminating the need for learning pruning masks and providing a straightforward method to reduce communication costs by incorporating ideas from compression but in the frequency space.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.4 </span>Aggregation Techniques in Federated Learning</h3>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fundamental principle of FL revolves around the concept of federated aggregation. This process involves merging local model updates from distributed clients to construct a unified global model, a step of critical importance in diverse settings such as distributed architectures.
Federated Averaging (<span id="S2.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>) is the conventional FL algorithm which was introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. The aim of <span id="S2.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> is to create a effective global model with wider coverage from the participating clients.
This is achieved through a weighted aggregation approach, where the influence of each client on the final model is proportionate to the size of its data. In practical terms, this means that clients with larger datasets have a greater impact on the FL system, a crucial consideration in distributed environments where data volume can vary significantly among clients.
<span id="S2.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> effectively harnesses the collective data wealth of all participating nodes, leading to a more holistic and representative global model in diverse FL scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another state-of-the-art FL methodology is the <span id="S2.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx</span> algorithm, introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, offers practical solutions for handling the challenges of system and statistical heterogeneity in FL.
These challenges are particularly evident in distributed computing and distributed machine learning scenarios.
<span id="S2.SS4.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx</span> is effective in environments where clients vary in computational power and network connectivity. It allows for partial updates from clients, a feature that is especially useful in distributed systems where devices might not always complete their computations due to varying capabilities or connectivity issues. The algorithm measures the extent of computation each client manages to complete, making it adaptable to the inconsistent participation often seen in these systems.
For statistical heterogeneity, <span id="S2.SS4.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx</span> introduces a proximal term in the local model update. This term acts like a balancing factor, ensuring that local models do not stray too far from the global model, despite the diverse data they might be learning from. This is particularly useful in distributed setups where each client might have access to very different types of data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While <span id="S2.SS4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> emphasises weighting clients according to their data distribution and <span id="S2.SS4.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedProx</span> effectively manages partial updates, the <span id="S2.SS4.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSim</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> algorithm introduces a distinct strategy: a similarity-guided clustering approach. During each iteration, <span id="S2.SS4.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSim</span> clusters clients based on the similarity of their local data, which is inferred from the shared, updated model. This initial phase involves performing an aggregation at the cluster level, primarily based on the size of the data.
Where each cluster synthesises a local cluster model, and these models are then collectively averaged to build the global model.
This method allows for a more detailed and targeted approach, which is particularly useful in networks where clients with similar data are spread out. It lets clients with similar data work together closely, while also making sure that clients with different data can contribute in their own way. This balanced way of working improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process in networks where data is shared across many clients.
This method is particularly effective in distributed systems, where clients often have similar data characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">All the aggregation techniques discussed possess unique advantages in the context of FL, yet they converge on a critical aspect: the communication bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the necessity for each client to transmit updated models back to the central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.
Addressing this crucial need, our focus shifts to enhancing communication within FL. This is where our proposed <span id="S2.SS4.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> method comes into play, aiming to significantly improve communication efficiency in these environments.</p>

In the case of <span id="S3.SS4.p1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span>, pruning on DCT coefficients results in lossy compression where it approximates and discards some of the less significant frequency coefficients.
Optimised compression with DCT is possible when a significant amount of the model parameters are captured within low-frequency coefficients.</p>

Pruning can be applied once convergence is close, at which point most of the model will be contained within a low-variance.

The plots show five synthetic Gaussian distributions, each with 0 mean and 10,000 samples for increasing variances (a) and their corresponding reconstruction errors (b), the x-axis is the variance, and the y-axis is the reconstruction error. It is clear from these plots that there is a direct relationship between increasing variance in distributions and increasing reconstruction errors. This confirms the benefits of using the difference model over the complete model and highlights the advantages of reduced variance in the frequency space for optimising compression in communication.</p>

Here, the variances in the y-axis are on a log scale and the x-axis is on communication rounds.
This plot further verifies the assertion made in Equation <a href="#S4.E8" title="In 4 Role of Model Variance for transformed communication ‣ FedFT: Improving Communication Performance for Federated Learning with Frequency Space Transformation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> that in the frequency space, the variance of the difference model is less than that of the complete model (blue and green lines).
We use variance here as a proxy for reconstruction error, where increasing variance (and so increasing reconstruction error) indicates the diminishing utility of pruning.</p>

we adapted the baseline FL methodologies to <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> and compared against their original form.
The comparison of FL methodologies adapted for <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> is carried out with a Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) model trained for classification.
We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using all of the selected baselines and datasets to represent a broad range of scenarios in FL settings.
By integrating <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> into different baseline methodologies, we could observe its performance and efficacy in comparison with their original forms.</p>

For the FEMNIST and MNIST datasets, a CNN-2D architecture with 6.49 million parameters is employed. In the case of Fed-MEx, a deep neural network called MLP-3 is utilised with 2.53 million parameters. Lastly, the Fed-Goodreads dataset employs an RNN architecture.
The hyperparameters are kept same with the exception of reducing the number of local epochs to 10 and the learning rate to 0.0001, to prevent over-fitting on the Fed-Goodreads dataset.

The datasets utilised in the <span id="S5.SS7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> experiments are carefully selected to reflect their realistic non-IID nature. These datasets are chosen based on previous research in FL, as discussed in Section <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1 Datasets ‣ 5 Experiment Setup ‣ FedFT: Improving Communication Performance for Federated Learning with Frequency Space Transformation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>.
In this analysis, we employ the FEMNIST dataset as our core dataset. To evaluate the impact of <span id="S5.SS7.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> across varying degrees of non-IID, we purpose three variants of the FEMNIST dataset: FEMNIST(1) with one class per client, FEMNIST(2) with two classes per client, and FEMNIST(3) with three classes per client.
The default configuration of the FEMNIST dataset used for primary experiments typically consists of three classes per client.</p>

The test accuracy at any given round is the mean of all test client accuracy values weighted by their test set sizes.

Overall, <span id="S6.SS3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> adaptations match the performance of baseline counterparts at convergence, demonstrating that efficient communication of model parameters in frequency space does not compromise performance.
The noticeable performance difference in the rounds prior to convergence across all methodologies on the Fed-MEx dataset is attributed to the small number of participating clients and their data sizes (30 total clients and 10 selected per round). With fewer clients who have fewer samples, each local update makes larger weight adjustments (high variance) resulting in significant changes to the global model.</p>

The results showed that <span id="S6.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> requires up to a 6% increase in resources compared to <span id="S6.SS5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedSim</span> and <span id="S6.SS5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span>.

Secondly, we can observe how <span id="S6.SS8.p2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> pruning can optimise communication cost when given thresholds for test accuracy and communication rounds.

The <span id="S6.SS8.p2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">bolded</span> figures highlight the optimal balance between accuracy and communication efficiency.</p>

<div id="S6.SS8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS8.p3.3" class="ltx_p">Finally, we address the issue where pruning at early stages of model training can lead to sub-optimal test accuracy.
To mitigate the risk of losing information about clients at the early stages of training, we propose applying pruning after some communication rounds, preferably post-convergence.

A promising direction for future research is to dynamically identify the ’sweet spot’ for optimal pruning results by analysing training patterns.
Additionally, a limitation to be explored in the future is the impact of varying levels of non-IID data on <span id="S7.p1.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> and the associated security implications of implementing <span id="S7.p1.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedFT</span> in FL systems.</p>
