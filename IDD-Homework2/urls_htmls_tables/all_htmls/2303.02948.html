<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Anomaly detection for the Internet of Things (IoT) is a major intelligent service required by many fields, including intrusion detection, state monitoring, device-activity analysis, and security supervision. However, the heterogeneous distribution of data and resource-constrained end nodes in ubiquitous IoT systems present challenges for existing anomaly detection models. Due to the advantages of flexible deployment and multi-dimensional resources, high altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are important components of vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets), have significant potential for sensing, computing, storage, and communication applications in ubiquitous IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a novel VHetNet-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework to enable decentralized UAVs to collaboratively train a global anomaly detection model based on their local sensory data from ubiquitous IoT devices. In the VHetNet-enabled AFL framework, a HAPS operates as a central aerial server, and the local models trained in UAVs are uploaded to the HAPS for global aggregation due to its wide coverage and strong storage and computation capabilities. We also introduce a UAV selection strategy into the AFL framework to prevent UAVs with low local model quality and large energy consumption from affecting the learning efficiency and detection accuracy of the global model. To ensure the security of transmissions between UAVs and the HAPS via wireless links, we add designed noise to local model parameters in UAVs to achieve differential privacy during the information exchange process. Moreover, we propose a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C)–based joint device association, UAV selection, and UAV trajectory planning algorithm to further enhance the overall federated execution efficiency and detection model accuracy under the UAV energy constraints. Extensive experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can achieve high detection accuracy with short federated execution time and low energy consumption.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to existing wireless technologies including 5G, 6G and beyond networks represent more than an improvement of basic performance requirements, such as increased data rates, reduced latency, and enhanced spectrum and energy efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. 6G and beyond networks are envisioned to have some unique characteristics. First, space networks (including satellites in low, medium and geostationary Earth orbits), air networks (including high altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)), and terrestrial networks (including macro and micro base stations), are integrated into vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets) to provide global coverage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Second, numerous devices, such as environmental monitoring sensors, healthcare wearables, and industrial control agents, are joining Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The ubiquitous IoT is expected to support seamless connectivity anytime, anywhere, and for everything <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Third, artificial intelligence (AI) penetrates into every corner of networks, ranging from end devices to the core. Network nodes are being endowed with built-in AI, which will support diversified AI services and facilitate intelligent network management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Anomaly detection is defined as a process of automatically detecting whether devices, components, or systems are running normally or not <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Anomaly detection is one of the indispensable AI services required by ubiquitous IoT devices for early warnings of abnormal behaviors and uninterrupted operations. Data is the basis of anomaly detection, and machine learning (ML) is the most commonly used technique for anomaly detection models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Traditional anomaly detection schemes in IoT usually utilize static sensors to perform data sensing and IoT gateways to forward the sensory data to a central server to learn a global anomaly detection model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, in situations where sensing targets are continually moving or are located in far-flung regions, traditional sensing solutions will experience significant challenges. In addition, due to the explosion of data in ubiquitous IoT, privacy concern and limited communication resources for data transmission present a major impediment to any centralized learning framework.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To implement anomaly detection in ubiquitous IoT, HAPSs and UAVs represent advanced approaches for smart sensing and data analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. A three-layer VHetNet consisting of a HAPS, UAVs, and IoT devices is a promising architecture for learning a global anomaly detection model, where UAVs are deployed as flying sensors for data sensing from IoT devices, and the HAPS is deployed as a central aerial server for data analysis and network control. Compared to static sensors, using UAVs as aerial nodes to provide wireless sensing support is a promising paradigm due to their wider field of view, highly flexible and controllable 3D mobility, and the capability of sensing performance optimization through UAV trajectory planning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In addition, a HAPS can work as an efficient central aerial server due to its quasi-stationary position, line-of-sight communication, wide coverage, and multiple energy sources, including conventional energy (such as electrical batteries and fuel tanks), energy beams, and solar energy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

By using FL, a UAV can perform local model training based on sensory data from its associated IoT devices, and local models from all UAVs are uploaded to the HAPS periodically for global aggregation. In general, compared to a centralized training framework, FL allows the VHetNet to learn a global anomaly detection model in a secure and efficient way. However, since there must be a periodic exchange of all UAV model parameters with the HAPS through wireless links during the model training process, the VHetNet-enabled FL framework still faces some challenges.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, FL was used with edge intelligence–powered small-cell networks to decrease the signaling overhead and computing complexity of base stations when collaborating to learn an intelligent computation offloading and interference coordination scheme.

To solve this problem, some studies have used a device selection scheme for FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL enables UAVs to execute local training using their own sensory data and avoid raw data transmission to the HAPS for privacy preservation and communication efficiency. Traditional FL commonly uses a synchronous learning mechanism to aggregate local models from all distributed agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Since the local model quality and battery power of different UAVs will differ during operations, the FL framework, which needs to wait for all UAVs to finish their local training before the global aggregation, will inevitably result in unstable model quality and increased learning latency. To address this, we develop a VHetNet-enabled AFL-based anomaly detection framework for ubiquitous IoT. Meanwhile, the UAV selection strategy is introduced into the AFL framework to keep UAVs with low local model quality and large energy consumption from affecting the learning efficiency and model accuracy.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The occurrence of abnormal behaviors is rare, so the sensing data from IoT devices will form an imbalanced training dataset. For this reason, we
implement the anomaly detection model by first building a normal behavioral representation and then determining abnormal behaviors on the basis of its deviation from the normal representation. In this paper, we use an improved generative adversarial network (GAN), namely WGAN-GP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, as the basic anomaly detection model for its powerful ability to capture distribution from high-dimensional complex data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS6.p1.15" class="ltx_p">In the three-layer VHetNet, we use UAVs to sense data from IoT devices and employ employ an AFL framework to establish a global anomaly detection model without local data centralization at the HAPS, which can enhance the data privacy and communication efficiency. For this AFL framework, a UAV selection strategy is desirable to select UAVs with high local model quality and low energy consumption to participate in the global aggregation at HAPS. In addition, it is necessary to schedule the trajectory of UAVs and device association to provide the best coverage for IoT devices with minimum energy comsumption. Overall, our objective is to maximize the coverage capacity of UAVs and minimize AFL model execution time and learning accuracy loss over all time slots, which leads to an efficient anomaly detection model. Therefore, we formulate the optimization problem as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The optimization problem formulated in (27) is challenging to solve because it is a non-convex combination and NP-hard problem. In addition, due to the time-varying feature of IoT device locations and UAV battery power, it is difficult for traditional optimization algorithms to address this problem. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising dynamic programming technique that is capable of handling sequential decision-making processes in dynamic environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.

Despite the accurate approximation, DNNs may cause a divergence in the training process or ineffective learning due to the non-stationary target values and the correlation among samples. To overcome these difficulties, a pair of techniques are introduced in DQN, namely fixed target network and experience replay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.

The dataset includes temperature, humidity, light, and voltage features collected from 54 distributed Mica2Dot sensors every 31 seconds during the period of February 28th, 2004 to April 5th, 2004.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We first evaluate the convergence performance of the proposed CA2C approach with different learning rates, which are set as 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001, sequentially. Fig. 2 shows the convergence of the system cost during the training processes of the CA2C approach. The system cost is the objective function defined in (27), which is the weighted combination of the coverage capacity, the execution time, and the learning accuracy loss. Note that an episode includes 50 time slots. Learning rates have a major impact on system cost and convergence speed. From Fig. 2, we can see that although a larger learning rate will mean a faster convergence process, it will lead to a higher system cost. However, the smaller learning rate does not always lead to less system cost. As shown in Fig. 2, when the learning rate is smaller than 0.0001 (i.e., when the learning rate is equal to 0.00001), the convergence process becomes slower, but the achieved system cost is not smaller than the situation when the learning rate is set as 0.0001. Therefore, we set the learning rate as 0.0001 to account for both the convergence speed and the system cost.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. 3 compares the convergence of the proposed differentially private WGAN-GP-based anomaly detection model under four different training frameworks, which are built on the proposed CA2C-AFL approach, the DQN-AFL approach, the DDPG-FL approach, and the standalone approach, respectively. From Fig. 3, we can observe that both the discriminator loss and generator loss can converge after certain episodes, which indicates that the generator and discriminator can be successfully trained in all four training frameworks. However, under the standalone training framework, the convergence speed is slow, and the training process is hard to converge to a stable value. This is because the standalone training framework trains the proposed model in each UAV without any data or information exchange, which causes poor data abundance and model robustness. Because the proposed CA2C-AFL-based training framework will plan the best trajectory for UAVs and select the best UAV subset with high model quality in the training process, it achieves the best convergence performance compared to the other three training frameworks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. 5 shows the detection performance of four different algorithms: namely the proposed CA2C-AFL-based, the DDPG-FL-based, the DQN-AFL-based, and the standalone anomaly detection algorithms. Precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the performance of different algorithms. We can observe that the convergence trend of the three evaluation metrics is nearly consistent with that of the discriminator loss and generator loss, which is shown in Fig. 3. It indicates that the four anomaly detection algorithms can capture the accurate data distribution from the training dataset with enough training episodes. From Fig. 5, we can see that the proposed CA2C-AFL algorithm can achieve the best detection performance in terms of all the three evaluation metrics. This is because the proposed algorithm will plan an optimal trajectory for UAVs and select UAVs with the highest quality models to join the global aggregation in the training process. The detection performance of the DDPG-FL and DQN-AFL algorithms is inferior to our proposed algorithm because these two include either UAV trajectory planning or UAV selection, but not both as our algorithm does. Besides, the detection performance of the standalone algorithm is the most unstable and inaccurate due to the lack of information fusion and exchange.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To further compare the detection performance of the four different algorithms, we use a new dataset, one that is not connected with any training process, as the test dataset to evaluate their generalization ability. From Fig. 6, we can see that the proposed CA2C-AFL algorithm can achieve the best detection accuracy when facing a new and unknown dataset. The DDPG-FL and DQN-AFL algorithms are inferior to the proposed algorithm but are still in an acceptable range. These results are due to the three algorithms including a process of information fusion and exchange among multiple datasets, which can enhance the generalization ability of the trained models. Comparing the detection performance of the standalone algorithm shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, we can observe that its detection accuracy decreases greatly, which means that the trained model has difficulty distinguishing normal behaviors from abnormal ones when presented with a new dataset. Therefore, the anomaly detection model based on the standalone algorithm has the worst generalization ability due to the lack of data diversity in its training process.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We also compare the average UAV energy consumption of the proposed CA2C-AFL algorithm with the DDPG-FL, DQN-AFL, and standalone algorithms. Fig. 7 shows the average energy consumption of all UAVs and their mean values. The UAV energy consumption presented in Fig. 7 is averaged over the total 200 episodes. From Fig. 7, we can see that the proposed CA2C-AFL algorithm consumes the least amount of energy among the four algorithms. The reason is that the proposed algorithm will plan the UAV trajectory with the aim of saving energy. Besides, unlike FL, in AFL, just a subset of UAVs need to update their local models in one global training round, which will also decrease the energy consumption. Since the random flying trajectory strategy adopted by the DQN-AFL and standalone algorithms will cause more energy consumption, the DDPG-FL algorithm consumes less energy than either of those algorithms. The standalone algorithm consumes more energy than the DQN-AFL algorithm because it requires all UAVs to update their own models in each training round.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fig. 8 shows the average execution time and maximum execution time of the four different algorithms over the total 200 episodes. The execution time for the anomaly detection model training consists of local model update latency, local model upload latency, global model aggregation latency, and global model distribution latency within all 50 time slots. From Fig. 8, we can see that the proposed CA2C-AFL algorithm has the shortest execution time, and the DDPG-FL algorithm has the longest execution time. This is because the DDPG-FL algorithm needs to wait for all UAVs to complete their local model updates before the global aggregation process can be executed. Besides, although the average execution time and maximum execution time of the DDPG-FL algorithm and standalone algorithm are the same, the average execution time of the proposed CA2C-AFL algorithm and DQN-AFL algorithm is less than their maximum execution time due to the presence of the UAV subset selection process.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied a VHetNet-enabled AFL-based anomaly detection framework for ubiquitous IoT devices with the assistance of a network scheduling strategy, which aimed to improve learning efficiency and detection accuracy. More specifically, the framework was designed to train local anomaly detection models at UAVs based on their sensory data and aggregated local models at a HAPS in an asynchronous manner. This aimed to decrease the federated learning execution time as well as the computation and transmission overheads. To ensure the secure transmission between UAVs and the HAPS, we adopted a differentially private WGAN-GP as the local anomaly detection model. Moreover, considering the limited onboard energy storage of UAVs, we formulated a joint device association, UAV selection, and UAV trajectory planning problem, which we solved using the CA2C approach to facilitate the efficient implementation of the self-scheduling anomaly detection model. Simulation results validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</p>
