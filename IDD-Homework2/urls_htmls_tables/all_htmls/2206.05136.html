<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel, fast and privacy preserving implementation of deep autoencoders. DAEF (Deep Autoencoder for Federated learning), unlike traditional neural networks, trains a deep autoencoder network in a non-iterative way, which drastically reduces its training time. Its training can be carried out in a distributed way (several partitions of the dataset in parallel) and incrementally (aggregation of partial models), and due to its mathematical formulation, the data that is exchanged does not endanger the privacy of the users. This makes DAEF a valid method for edge computing and federated learning scenarios. The method has been evaluated and compared to traditional (iterative) deep autoencoders using seven real anomaly detection datasets, and their performance have been shown to be similar despite DAEF’s faster training.</p>

<p id="p2.2" class="ltx_p">As happened at the time with the massive adoption of personal computers, the technological development of recent years has caused a substantial increase in the number of small computing machines such as smartphones or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, for both industrial and personal use. Despite their size, these devices have enough computing power to perform tasks that until a few years ago were considered unapproachable, such as the training of small machine learning models, real-time inference or the exchange of large amounts of information at high speeds.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p3.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the abundance of these devices and the inefficiencies of traditional cloud computing for applications that demand low latencies, a new computing paradigm called edge computing has emerged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">KHAN2019219</span>]</cite>. Edge computing moves computing away from data centers to the edge of the network, bringing cloud computing services and utilities closer to the end user and their devices. This allows faster information processing and response time, as well as freeing up the network bandwidth.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p4.1" class="ltx_p">From a machine learning point of view, this new technological scenario is very suitable for the application of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">XIA2021100008</span>]</cite>. Federated learning is a collaborative machine learning scheme that allows heterogeneous devices with different private data sets to work together to train a global model. In addition to this collaborative learning, this work scheme emphasizes the preservation of the privacy of local data collected on each device by implementing mechanisms that prevent possible direct and indirect leaks of their data.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p5.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, in machine learning, anomaly detection is the branch that builds models capable of differentiating between normal and anomalous data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">10.1145/1541880.1541882</span>]</cite>. A priori, this turns anomaly detection into a classification problem with only two classes. However, since anomalies tend to occur sporadically, normal data are the ones that prevail in these scenarios, so it is common that models must be trained with only normal data.
The objective is to learn to represent the normal class with high precision in order to be able to classify new data as either normal or abnormal. In many real systems, the response time to a detection of an anomaly (failure) can be critical, as is the case with autonomous vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">8744265</span>]</cite> or industrial systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">9139976</span>]</cite>. The development of anomaly detection techniques based on edge computing and federated learning may be the solution to reduce these response times.</p>

<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we introduce DAEF (Deep Autoencoder for Federated learning), a fast and privacy‐preserving deep autoencoder for edge computing and federated learning scenarios. Unlike traditional deep neural networks, its learning method is non-iterative, which drastically reduces training time. Its training can be carried out in a distributed way (several partitions of the dataset in parallel) and incrementally (aggregation of partial models), and due to its mathematical formulation the data that is exchanged does not endanger the privacy of the users. All of this makes DAEF a valid method for edge computing and federated training scenarios, capable of performing tasks as anomaly detection on large datasets while maintaining the performance of traditional (iterative) autoencoders.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Anomaly detection is a field that has a large number of algorithms that solve the problem of distinguishing between normal and anomalous instances in a wide variety of ways <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">chandola</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">khan</span>]</cite>. Depending on the assumptions and processes they employ, in traditional anomaly detection we can distinguish between five main types of methods : probabilistic, distance-based, information theory-based, boundary-based, and reconstruction-based methods. In general, these algorithms are characterized by their high performance when classifying new data, however they do not focus on other aspects which from a centralized perspective may seem less important, such as data privacy and incremental learning. This makes it difficult to apply many of these classical methods in decentralized environments. For this reason, the strong expansion of edge computing has brought with it a new line of research in the field of anomaly detection in charge of designing new algorithms capable of learning in a distributed and, in some cases, incremental way, while preserving data privacy. Due to their good performance, it is common for these methods to be based on reconstruction (neural networks). In this section we will distinguish between reconstruction based methods that use autoencoders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">10.5555/1756006.1953039</span>]</cite> and those that do not.</p>

B. Hussain <span id="Sx1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">8844663</span>]</cite> presented a deep learning framework to monitor user activities of multiple cells and thus detect anomalies using feedforward deep neural networks.

Other authors like D. Preuveneers <span id="Sx1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">app8122663</span>]</cite> propose the use of blockchain technology to carry out a decentralized registry of federated model updates. This guarantees the integrity of incrementally-learned machine learning models by cryptographically chaining one machine learning model to the next. These solutions obtain good results, however they do not emphasize privacy preservation and their iterative learning can lead to long training times.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, if we focus on autoencoders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">10.5555/1756006.1953039</span>]</cite>, it is also possible to find works oriented towards edge computing and/or federated learning scenarios. Autoencoders (AE) are a type of self-associative neural network whose output layer seeks to reproduce the data presented to the input layer after having gone through a dimensional compression phase. In this way, they manage to obtain a representation of the input data in a space with a dimension smaller than the original, learning a compact representation of the data, retaining the important information and compressing the redundant one. For this reason, they are widely used for the elaboration of models that are robust to noise, an important quality in anomaly detection and regression problems. <span id="Sx1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Figure 1</span> represents the traditional architecture of an autoencoder network.</p>

These devices send their local data to a central cloud node from which the training of the global model is carried out. In the approach presented by M.

<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the two previous works, as well as in the majority that use this type of networks, the autoencoders are trained during several iterations to adjust their parameters (weights, bias) using techniques such as the gradient descent and backpropagation.

<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, there is a line of work that allows training autoencoders in a non-iterative way.

Over time, more advanced versions such as MLELM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">KasunRepresentationalLW</span>]</cite>, a multilayer version of ELM, or DELM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DELM</span>]</cite>, a deep version of ELM, have been developed.</p>

The aim in the encoder is to learn a vector space embedding of the input data extracting a meaningful but lower dimensional representation. To achieve this dimensionality reduction, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of matrices is used. In the decoder, the goal is to reconstruct the input from the low-dimensional representation, in this case using LANN-SVD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">lannsvd</span>]</cite>. The privacy-preserving properties, parallelization, and non-iterative training of this method make it a suitable alternative for anomaly detection in edge computing scenarios and a good basis for out work, although it has the limitation of only allowing the use of one hidden layer.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In the encoder, the goal is to learn a vector space embedding of the input data extracting a useful but lower‐dimensional representation, known as the latent space. This can be accomplished by a low‐rank matrix approximation, which is a minimization problem that tries to approximate a given matrix of data by another one subject to the constraint that the approximating matrix has reduced rank <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">RePEc:spr:psycho:v:1:y:1936:i:3:p:211-218</span>]</cite>.

THE PROPOSED METHOD ‣ Fast Deep Autoencoder for Federated learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> contains the pseudocode for the DAEF training phase. The processes carried out in the encoder are described between lines 5 and 12. In line 7 the dimensionality of the data is reduced by means of SVD in a distributed way, obtaining the encoder weights and, in line 9, the encoder output. Between lines 13 and 19, the hidden layers of the decoder are trained one by one. For this, Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 4.4 Pseudocode ‣ 4. THE PROPOSED METHOD ‣ Fast Deep Autoencoder for Federated learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> is used (line 15). Between lines 20 and 25, the last layer of the decoder is trained directly using ROLANN.</p>
