<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a novel framework to address straggling and privacy issues for federated learning (FL)-based mobile application services, taking into account limited computing/communications resources at mobile users (MUs)/mobile application provider (MAP), privacy cost, the rationality and incentive competition among MUs in contributing data to the MAP. Particularly, the MAP first determines a set of the best MUs for the FL process based on the MUs’ provided information/features. To mitigate straggling problems with privacy-awareness, each selected MU can then encrypt part of local data and upload the encrypted data to the MAP for an encrypted training process, in addition to the local training process. For that, each selected MU can propose a contract to the MAP according to its expected trainable local data and privacy-protected encrypted data. To find the optimal contracts that can maximize utilities of the MAP and all the participating MUs while maintaining high learning quality of the whole system, we first develop a multi-principal one-agent contract-based problem leveraging FL-based multiple utility functions. These utility functions account for the MUs’ privacy cost, the MAP’s limited computing resources, and asymmetric information between the MAP and MUs. Then, we transform the problem into an equivalent low-complexity problem and develop a light-weight iterative algorithm to effectively find the optimal solutions. Experiments with a real-world dataset show that our framework can speed up training time up to 49% and improve prediction accuracy up to 4.6 times while enhancing the network’s social welfare, i.e., total utility of all participating entities, up to 114% under the privacy cost consideration compared with those of baseline methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The ever-growing big data market between mobile users (MUs) and mobile application providers (MAPs) for emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based mobile application services (e.g., healthcare, crowdsensing, and mobile social network applications) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> has recently attracted paramount interest from both industry and academia. Through utilizing the collected local data from many mobile devices, e.g., via embedded sensors, the AI-based mobile application services can extract the meaningful information leveraging machine learning (ML) approaches, e.g., centralized learning at the cloud server and local learning at mobile devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, there exist two inherent challenges when applying such conventional ML approaches for AI-based mobile application services. First, MUs may not want to share their raw data due to the privacy risk of storing/processing data at the centralized servers. Second, MUs with limited computing/communications resources as well as unreliable wireless channels can be stragglers, adversely impacting the learning/training quality/time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has been considered as a highly-effective learning approach to deal with the aforementioned problems. Like distributed learning, FL facilitates collaborative learning among multiple entities, e.g., MUs, without requiring them to share their raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In particular, each participating MU can first train its local data to produce a local trained model independently. Then, the MAP can collect the local models from all participating MUs to update the global model iteratively. Nonetheless, similar to the centralized learning above, MUs are usually limited in computing and communications resources. For that, the quality of the FL process may deteriorate when some of the MUs experience low computing resources to train their local dataset and/or unstable wireless communication links when sharing the local trained models to the MAP at each learning round (referred to as <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">straggling</em> MUs). Consequently, FL may likely suffer from significant delay because the MAP needs to wait for local trained models from all the participating MUs at each learning round to update the global model. To address the straggling problem, data from straggling MUs can be uploaded to an edge/a cloud server for the FL process (on behalf of the straggling MUs) as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. However, this approach cannot be widely adopted as MUs usually do not want to send the raw data to the edge/cloud server, e.g., the MAP, for processing due to privacy concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the straggling problems while preserving data privacy for the participating MUs under their limited computing resources, parts of local datasets from the participating MUs can be first encrypted to preserve their dataset privacy and then sent to the MAP for the additional encrypted training process. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> first use homomorphic encryption (i.e., an encryption algorithm which allows operations to be executed directly on encrypted data/ciphertext without decryption) to protect the privacy of their local data and then send the encrypted data to the MAP for the encrypted training process, e.g., leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM). Nonetheless, both works only consider deep learning approaches to train the whole data at the MAP. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, instead of encrypting the local datasets to share them with the MAP, MUs train their whole datasets locally then only encrypt their local models before sending them to the MAP. Note that <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and other similar works in the literature do not account for the cryptography overhead/cost as well as limited computing and communications resources of the MAP and MUs. Moreover, they lack an incentive mechanism to motivate the MUs to participate in the FL processes, especially under the competition/conflict-of-interest among the MUs considering their diverse computing resources and data. To this end, how to optimally compensate all the participating MUs while maximizing the MAP’s benefit under the privacy protection for the MUs and limited computing resources from the MAP and MUs remains as an open issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel framework to address straggling and privacy issues for an FL-based mobile application service leveraging data encryption and additional encrypted training process at the MAP given the limited computing/communications resources at MUs/MAP, privacy cost, the rationality and incentive competition among MUs in contributing data to the MAP. In particular, the MAP can first select the best active MUs in its considered area (e.g., a shopping mall or a residential area) based on their shared information, i.e., selection metric values. This aims to obtain reliable trained model updates for the global model accuracy of the FL process with minimum straggling issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. After the MU selection process, the MAP can provide incentives/payments to encourage these MUs to contribute their data to the training process. In this way, the MAP can improve its learning quality to produce highly-accurate prediction model, thereby maximizing its utility correspondingly. Meanwhile, the participating MUs can maximize their utilities through acquiring certain incentives from the MAP in exchange for training the local datasets and/or sharing the encrypted datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, since there exists conflict-of-interest among the selected MUs due to their limited computing resources to train their local datasets, each participating MU may compete with other participating MUs in offloading encrypted dataset to the MAP for the additional training process under the MAP’s limited computing resources (e.g., due to heavy workloads from other computationally-intensive services).
To cope with this problem, Stackelberg game models can be used to study the interactions between the MUs and the MAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, these game models are only applicable when the MUs and the MAP have full information about each other (referred to as <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">information symmetry</em>), e.g., the MUs know the MAP’s current computing resources.
In practice, the MAP usually keeps its computing resources as private information (referred to as <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">information asymmetry</em>).
Additionally, the MUs may not be interested in fully following the offers from the MAP due to the conflict of economic preferences between them. Hence, the above Stackelberg game models are not applicable to our considered problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned problem, we develop a <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">multi-principal one-agent (MPOA)</em> contract-based framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, in which the participating MUs (as <em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">principals</em>) can first offer contract items, i.e., the sizes of local and uploaded encrypted datasets as well as their requested payments, to the MAP. Then, the MAP (as <em id="S1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the agent</em>) can optimize the offered contracts on behalf of the participating MUs under its limited computing resources. Specifically, we formulate a privacy-preserving FL contract problem that can maximize the utilities of the MAP and the selected MUs for the entire FL process under the MAP’s information-asymmetry and common constraints. These constraints guarantee that the MAP will always obtain a non-negative and maximum utility during the FL process. Unlike the contract problem for the conventional FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, in our framework, there exist two utility functions required to be addressed and optimized by each participating MU and the MAP, i.e., one for the encrypted (sharing) training data and the other for the unencrypted (local) training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To obtain the optimal contracts, the FL contract optimization problem is first transformed into an equivalent problem with a lower complexity (due to constraint reduction). Then, an iterative algorithm is developed to quickly find the equilibrium solution, i.e., optimal contracts, for the transformed problem. This equilibrium solution can achieve the performance gap of less than 1% compared with that of the information-symmetry FL contract, i.e., when each MU is fully aware of other MUs’ available dataset sizes and the MAP’s actual computing resources. Upon receiving the optimal contracts from the MAP, both the MAP and selected MUs can implement the proposed FL algorithm. We evaluate our FL-based framework using a real-world human activity recognition (HAR) dataset with 15M activity recognition samples from MUs’ devices in 2019 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. While considering the privacy costs, the experimental results show that our privacy-preserving FL-based framework can speed up the training time up to 49% and improve the accuracy level up to 4.6 times compared with those of baseline methods, i.e., conventional FL methods without using the proposed framework. Furthermore, the proposed framework can enhance the social welfare of the mobile network up to 114% compared with that of the baseline methods. The main contributions of our work are as follows:</p>

Then, the encrypted datasets from all MUs can be collected by the MAP for the additional encrypted training process. In this case, the local/unencrypted dataset at each MU will be used for the local learning process as similarly implemented in the conventional FL approach. The mechanism on how to obtain optimal sizes of encrypted and unencrypted datasets is explained in Section <a href="#S4" title="4 MPOA-Based FL Contract Optimization Problem ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

At each learning round, all MUs first train their local unencrypted datasets and then send the encrypted local trained models to the MAP (to preserve the privacy of the local trained models). Meanwhile, the MAP also trains all the collected encrypted datasets to produce another encrypted trained model. After completing the learning process within a training time threshold at each round (which is predefined by the MAP), the MAP can collect the encrypted local models from the MUs and aggregate them to obtain the aggregated encrypted local model. After that, the aggregated encrypted local model from MUs and encrypted model from the MAP can be combined together to update the encrypted global model, which is then used for the next FL process at the MUs and MAP. Note that the MUs are required to decrypt the encrypted global model before utilizing it to train the unencrypted local dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Moreover, for each learning round, the MAP only requires to aggregate any encrypted models that are received within a pre-defined training time threshold, due to additional training at the MAP. The above processes aim to guarantee the learning convergence while minimizing the straggling problems from the straggling MUs.</p>

In practice, the MAP retains its willingness to train the collected encrypted datasets as an unknown information for the MUs due to its economic benefit.

Particularly, a higher type implies the willingness to train more encrypted sensing datasets from the MUs due to its higher available computing resources. In other words, the willingness to train more encrypted datasets can compensate the low computing resources and straggling problems more, and thus bring more benefits for the MUs and better learning quality for the MAP.

For the proposed FL, each MU obtains the size of its optimal encrypted dataset based on the MAP’s type. In particular, 10%, 30%, and 50% encrypted datasets of the whole dataset (from all MUs in <math id="S7.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{N}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S7.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒩</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S7.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝒩</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{N}</annotation></semantics></math>), i.e., Enc 10%, Enc 30%, and Enc 50%, represent the MAP with type 2, 6, and 10, respectively. Next, we split the pre-processed dataset into 80% training set and 20% testing set. To represent a practical scenario where each mobile device may capture different activities from its MU, we consider a non-i.i.d dataset distribution scenario. As such, we first sort the training set according to the training labels in ascending order. Then, a certain number of samples from the sorted training set is equally distributed to the selected MUs sequentially. For the CNN, we use three-stacked 1D-convolutional layers with 64 filters and 3, 5, and 11 kernel sizes for each corresponding layer. We also utilize a BLSTM and two hidden DNN layers with 64 neurons for each layer followed by a dropout layer with fraction rate 0.25. For the optimizer, we use the Adam optimizer with initial step size 0.01 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

This utility follows a monotonic increasing function with respect to the MAP’s type because the MAP is willing to train more encrypted datasets due to higher benefit for the MAP in terms of the global model accuracy. Moreover, the MAP can also produce the highest utility when it applies the right contract for its true type, i.e., the IC constraints in (<a href="#S4.E12" title="In Definition 1. ‣ 4.2 Utility Optimization for Participating MUs ‣ 4 MPOA-Based FL Contract Optimization Problem ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>) are satisfied, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 7.3.1 IR and IC constraint feasibility of the MAP ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(b). For example, the MAP with types 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will generate the highest utility when corresponding contracts for the respective types are applied. Since both IR and IC constraints are satisfied, we can obtain the feasible contracts for all participating MUs to maximize their utilities in the proposed FL process.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We then compare the MAP’s utility of the proposed framework with those of the baseline and information-symmetry methods. As can be observed in Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 7.3.1 IR and IC constraint feasibility of the MAP ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(a), the proposed framework can achieve the highest utility for all types of the MAP especially when the MAP’s type gets higher. Particularly, the proposed framework can obtain the utility up to 17% higher than that of the baseline method. The reason is that the baseline method cannot optimize the encrypted dataset proportion from the MAP since each participating MU only can send the proportional amount of encrypted dataset under the MAP’s current computing resources (to train the whole encrypted datasets from all participating MUs). Additionally, the information-symmetry method suffers from zero utility for all types because all participating MUs can collaborate together to obtain maximum utility through completely perceiving the current true type, i.e., the available computing resources, of the MAP. Consequently, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 7.3.1 IR and IC constraint feasibility of the MAP ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(b), the information-symmetry method can maximize the total utility of participating MUs. In this case, the proposed framework can still outperform the baseline method up to 113% in terms of the total utility of participating MUs. An interesting point can be observed in Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 7.3.1 IR and IC constraint feasibility of the MAP ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>(c). Particularly, although the information-symmetry can obtain the total utility of the MUs up to 2.6 times higher than that of the proposed framework, our proposed framework can achieve the social welfare within 0.57% of the information-symmetry method (which acts as the upper bound solution). Moreover, the proposed framework can obtain the social welfare up to 42% higher than that of the baseline method. To this end, we can demonstrate that our proposed framework is applicable to implement in the proposed FL process through stabilizing the utility performance of the MAP and participating MUs efficiently. Then, we observe the contract performance of our FL-based framework compared with that of the conventional FL method. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.3.1 IR and IC constraint feasibility of the MAP ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the use of encrypted training in our FL-based framework, i.e., 10%, 30%, and 50% encrypted datasets, can improve the utility of the MAP, the total utility of the participating MUs, and social welfare of the network up to 93%, 162%, and 114%, respectively, compared with those of the conventional FL method. The reason is that the MUs can reduce remarkable training tasks through offloading their encrypted datasets to the MAP for the encrypted training, which then leads to better learning quality, especially when some MUs suffer from straggling computing resources. These results reflect that a higher proportion of encrypted dataset at the MAP may result in higher utilities and social welfare for both the participating MUs and the MAP at the expense of a higher privacy protection cost (which is further discussed in Section <a href="#S7.SS5" title="7.5 Trade-off Between Training Time and Privacy Cost ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7.5</span></a>).</p>

<div id="S7.SS4.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS4.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first analyze performance of the proposed FL with straggling mitigation and privacy-awareness when the MAP updates the encrypted global model upon successfully receiving the encrypted local models from a fixed number of participating MUs at each learning round. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7.3.2 The utility of the MAP/participating MUs and the social welfare ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, the proposed FL generally can maintain its accuracy performance for all participating MU scenarios regardless the encrypted dataset proportion of the participating MUs. Specifically, when all local models from 10 participating MUs are applied to update the encrypted global model at each round in Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7.3.2 The utility of the MAP/participating MUs and the social welfare ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(a), the accuracy performance for the conv-FL and proposed FL approaches can achieve the best results due to the equal size of training samples at each participating MU (including at the MAP for the proposed FL with 10% encrypted dataset). Although the conv-FL can eventually obtain the same final accuracy level at 88% as the proposed FL with 10% encrypted dataset proportion, the proposed FL provides more stable accuracy performance at each learning round and achieves the convergence rate 28.5% faster than that of the conv-FL method. Note that the proposed FL with 30% and 50% encrypted datasets converge to 2% lower accuracy level (i.e., at level 86%) compared with that of the conv-FL due to high imbalanced size of non-i.i.d training samples at the participating MUs and the MAP, i.e., the number of training samples at the MAP is much larger than that at each MU. As such, the aggregation of encrypted local models from participating MUs and the MAP will slightly degrade final accuracy of the converged global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS4.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS4.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When less encrypted local models, i.e., 7 participating MUs to 1 participating MU, are used to update the encrypted global model (representing worse straggling issues), the proposed FL for all encrypted dataset proportions can maintain their accuracy performance at the same final accuracy level, thanks to the additional training at the MAP. Meanwhile, the performance of conv-FL suffers from the accuracy degradation due to insufficient number of non-i.i.d samples to boost the accuracy level. To this end, the proposed FL for all encrypted dataset proportions can obtain the accuracy gap with the conv-FL up to 1.72 times, 1.72 times, 2.9 times, and 4.6 times using 7 MUs, 5 MUs, 3 MUs, and 1 MU scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7.3.2 The utility of the MAP/participating MUs and the social welfare ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(e), we can observe that the use of higher encrypted dataset proportion sent to the MAP, i.e., 50% encrypted dataset, can bring more stable accuracy performance at each learning round and reach the convergence 70% (70 rounds) and 127% (140 rounds) faster than those of 10% and 30% encrypted dataset scenarios, respectively. This means that when more devices have straggling problems (i.e., only very few participating MUs are used as the FL learners) at each learning round, the use of larger encrypted training at the MAP can greatly compensate the insufficient training samples at the MUs. In this case, within 500 learning rounds, the conv-FL even cannot reach the convergence due to high fluctuation of the accuracy performance. Then, the confusion matrix to show how good the prediction model towards each activity label for the proposed FL with 10% encrypted dataset and 10 participating MUs can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7.3.2 The utility of the MAP/participating MUs and the social welfare ‣ 7.3 Proposed FL Contract Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(f). Based on the above performances, it can be implied that a higher type of the MAP (which corresponds to a larger encrypted dataset proportion at the MAP) generally can speed up the convergence rate, improve global model accuracy, and provide more stable performance especially when a small fixed number of MUs participate in the FL process.</p>

<div id="S7.SS4.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To further show the superiority of proposed FL, we consider various straggling probabilities, i.e, the probabilities that participating MUs experience the straggling problems, e.g., due to low computing resources and/or bad communication resources, such that they cannot send the encrypted local models to the MAP at a certain learning round. Using fixed 5 participating MUs at each learning round, we consider 20%, 50%, and 80% straggling probabilities. In this case, the higher the straggling probability is, the lower the number of participating MUs that can send the encrypted local models to the MAP at each round. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 7.4.1 Accuracy with various number of participating MUs ‣ 7.4 Proposed FL Accuracy Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the proposed FL can preserve its accuracy approximately at level 86% for all straggling probability scenarios. In contrast, the conv-FL cannot maintain its accuracy when the straggling probability gets worse. As such, in terms of the converged accuracy performance, the proposed FL can outperform the conv-FL up to 1.84 times, 3.35 times, and 3.44 times for 20%, 50%, and 80% straggling probability scenarios, respectively. The interesting point is that the proposed FL with 50% encrypted dataset can fully keep its accuracy at the same level with stable values for most of learning rounds, while the ones with 10% and 30% encrypted datasets degrade their accuracy performances when the straggling probability gets higher. The reason is that the higher encrypted training at the MAP can compensate the straggling problems at the participating MUs more due to its learning process improvement with respect to the larger size of encrypted dataset.</p>

<div id="S7.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the accuracy and convergence rate performance, the proposed FL outperforms the conv-FL in terms of the training time to complete 500 learning rounds. Specifically, as observed in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7.4.2 Accuracy with various straggling probabilities ‣ 7.4 Proposed FL Accuracy Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>(a), the conv-FL requires the longest training time, i.e., 1702 seconds, to reach 500 learning rounds. Meanwhile, for the proposed FL, the larger the encrypted dataset proportion is trained at the MAP (i.e., the higher the type of the MAP is), the faster the training time to complete 500 learning rounds. This is due to the smaller number of local datasets to be trained at the participating MUs such that the encrypted local models can be aggregated faster at the MAP to update the encrypted global model. In this case, the proposed FL with 10%, 30%, 50% encrypted datasets can reduce the training time up to 10%, 30%, and 49%, respectively, compared with that of the conv-FL. The training time result contradicts with the total privacy protection cost of all participating MUs for sharing encrypted datasets to the MAP. As observed in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7.4.2 Accuracy with various straggling probabilities ‣ 7.4 Proposed FL Accuracy Performance ‣ 7 Performance Evaluation ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>(b), the performance of total privacy cost follows a logarithmic function (as defined in (<a href="#S2.E2" title="In 2.1 Federated Learning with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness Overview ‣ 2 Proposed Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness ‣ Federated Learning Framework with Straggling Mitigation and Privacy-Awareness for AI-based Mobile Application Services" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>)) with respect to the proportion of total uploaded encrypted dataset. As such, although more encrypted dataset offloading comes with higher privacy protection cost, the privacy of offloaded encrypted datasets can be still protected efficiently. This interesting trade-off provides an insightful information to selectively determine the best FL scenarios which can improve the learning quality, i.e., straggling problem reduction with higher global model accuracy and faster training time/convergence rate, while minimizing the privacy protection cost of encrypted dataset sharing in the FL process.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed the novel FL-based framework with straggling mitigation and privacy-awareness for the mobile application service to maximize the utilities for the MAP and participating MUs while improving the global model accuracy with additional encrypted training. Particularly, we have designed the MU selection scheme to determine the best MUs based on the abstract of dataset and device information. Using the selected MUs, we have developed the MPOA-based FL contract problem under the MAP’s common constraints (i.e., the IR and IC constraints), the competition among participating MUs, and unknown computing resources from the MAP. To obtain the optimal contracts containing the MUs’ optimal sizes of encrypted and local datasets for the FL process, we have transformed the problem and implemented the iterative FL contract algorithm that can achieve the equilibrium solution for all the participating MUs. The experiments have demonstrated that our proposed framework can significantly improve the training time, prediction accuracy, utilities, and social welfare of the MAP and participating MUs (while considering the privacy protection cost of encrypted datasets) compared with those of other baseline methods.</p>
