<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) has garnered significant interest recently due to its potential as an effective solution for tackling many challenges in diverse application scenarios, for example, data privacy in network edge traffic classification. Despite its recognized advantages, FL encounters obstacles linked to statistical data heterogeneity and labeled data scarcity during the training of single-task models for machine learning-based traffic classification, leading to hindered learning performance. In response to these challenges, adopting a hard-parameter sharing multi-task learning model with auxiliary tasks proves to be a suitable approach. Such a model has the capability to reduce communication and computation costs, navigate statistical complexities inherent in FL contexts, and overcome labeled data scarcity by leveraging knowledge derived from interconnected auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new framework for federated auxiliary hard-parameter sharing multi-task learning, namely, FedAuxHMTL. The introduced framework incorporates model parameter exchanges between edge server and base stations, enabling base stations from distributed areas to participate in the FedAuxHMTL process and enhance the learning performance of the main task—network edge traffic classification. Empirical experiments are conducted to validate and demonstrate the FedAuxHMTL’s effectiveness in terms of accuracy, total global loss, communication costs, computing time, and energy consumption compared to its counterparts.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, federated learning (FL), an emerging decentralized machine learning (ML) technique, has gained significant attention within the research community. This heightened interest can be attributed to FL’s ability to safeguard privacy and effectively tackle the obstacles linked to data sensitivity. In the context of FL, a diverse range of network components collaborate in the training of an ML model while preserving the decentralized nature of the training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This strategy exhibits a notable contrast to other known strategies, such as the practice of uploading training data to a centralized server. However, The latter approach poses a considerable risk of data leakage and an increase in data communication overhead. Conversely, the model parameters derived from the ML model of local network components are combined and consolidated within the framework of FL. The aforementioned procedure results in the development of a globally robust model, hence enhancing privacy-preserving techniques through the provision of enhanced security and data access credentials <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The FL approach endeavors to train a global model for a given task and is exclusively suitable for circumstances where the data is homogeneous<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. However, it is frequently seen that data distributions exhibit heterogeneity among various network components in numerous application scenarios. In this context, the network edge traffic classification may serve as an example where the allocation of uplink network traffic among multiple base stations (BSs) frequently illustrates non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) characteristics. This heterogeneous non-IID attribute arises due to diverse constraints and requirements associated with these BSs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Traffic classification is widely recognized as a fundamental task in the fields of network traffic monitoring, service improvement, and network security management. Specifically, it aims to establish a correlation between the network traffic and a certain category of traffic application, such as Google Voice, with the primary objective of guaranteeing quality of service (QoS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Currently, ML methods are extensively utilized in traffic classification; for example, conventional ML techniques, such as KNN, Naïve Bayes, and SVM methods, are commonly employed in such classification. However, these methods require human efforts to design extracted features that are unable to apprehend the convoluted patterns of network traffic. Due to recent significant advancements in ML, deep learning is widely used in classification tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Specifically, it is favored for its exceptional ability to comprehend complex patterns and intelligently extract features. Nevertheless, deep learning requires a substantial quantity of labeled training data in a central location to learn patterns. Centralizing labeled training data incurs significant communication costs. In such a case, FL can be utilized to reduce the burden of high communication costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the process of collecting and labeling traffic data is a time-intensive task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the limitations of obtaining labeled training data in network edge traffic classification combined with the FL data heterogeneity introduce additional obstacles.
Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as an effective solution to combat such obstacles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Particularly, hard-parameter sharing MTL with auxiliary tasks can effectively addresses labeled data scarcity and data heterogeneity in FL scenarios. By integrating multiple auxiliary tasks, MTL enhances main task performance and improves computational efficiency compared to individual single-task models, as tasks can leverage shared information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning, a prevalent ML technique has been widely applied to various classification challenges, including network traffic classification as highlighted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> introduces DISTILLER, an innovative multimodal MTL-deep learning approach designed to address the complex challenges of network traffic classification and enhance network visibility. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> explores three MTL approaches to improve application traffic classification by exploiting task interdependencies, aiming to boost classification performance through the recognition of task relationships. The employment of MTL is advocated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> for the simultaneous prediction of both bandwidth and duration of network traffic flows, as well as for classifying the network traffic into distinct categories. This study demonstrates that the prediction of bandwidth and flow duration can be achieved without the requirement for extensive labeling efforts or specific conditions, thereby rendering the need for ample training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, authors introduced a multi-task deep neural network in FL, namely, MT-DNN-FL, for the concurrent execution of VPN traffic recognition, network anomaly detection, and network traffic classification tasks. According to their findings, the application of MT-DNN-FL results in a reduction of training time overhead in comparison to the several FL-DNN single-task models. The study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> presents a novel approach that combines MTL and FL to train personalized MTL models, namely, pFedDAMT, for encrypted traffic classification. The proposed pFedDAMT framework is designed to tackle the issue of data heterogeneity by employing a two-stage federated personalized MTL approach.</p>

Specifically, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> overlooked the aspect of data heterogeneity, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> acknowledged and addressed this concern, yet failed to take into account the computation and communication costs.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the realm of auxiliary hard-parameter sharing MTL, where the main task’s performance is prioritized, a significant challenge is balancing the auxiliary tasks. Various dynamic loss weighting strategies have been developed to mitigate this issue. A notable example, as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, is the random loss weighting strategy. This approach involves assigning loss weights randomly from a distribution to train a hard-parameter sharing MTL model. This study adopts the aforementioned strategy to optimize loss weights for auxiliary tasks aiming to improve the main task’s learning performance.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The FedAuxHMTL is implemented on the CISCO Flame platform <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The Flame is a comprehensive tool for customizing FL applications to fit specific deployment contexts. Moreover, Flame’s key feature is its system-level configuration capability for FL application topologies, which is further enhanced by its scalability to new FL architectures. This customization is facilitated through Topology Abstraction Graphs (TAGs), which separate ML application logic from deployment complexities. This approach significantly reduces the need for development resources in tailoring application deployment.</p>

Hence, it can be conclude that FedAuxHMTL has higher convergence speed compared to the baselines. The reason behind this is that, due to using auxiliary MTL setup in FedAuxHMTL, communication efficacy improved as well as privacy is preserved.

This particular result is included to demonstrate that FedAuxHMTL can achieve convergence for non-convex loss functions.

The reason is, due to use of MTL framework with auxiliary tasks, the main task got the lowest loss and consequently, this led to a reduction in the total global loss as compared to conventional FMTL.</p>

This difference stems from the simpler network structure of FedAuxHMTL and MT-DNN-FL, since FedAvg-Combined cannot share layers between tasks. FedAuxHMTL with RLW has slightly longer computing time than with ELW, due to the Softmax function’s exponential component in its weighting strategy. A similar explanation applies to MT-DNN-FL, due to its structure for sharing parameters.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we introduced FedAuxHMTL that significantly improves the learning performance of network edge traffic classification. Additionally, FedAuxHMTL demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating communication and computation costs. The equal weighting and the designed random weighting are integrated with the introduced FedAuxHMTL and compacted with existing federated multi-task and single-task learning approaches. Simulation results showed and validated the efficacy of the introduced FedAuxHMTL framework.</p>
