<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has rapidly risen in popularity due to its promise of privacy and efficiency. Previous works have exposed privacy vulnerabilities in the FL pipeline by recovering user data from gradient updates. However, existing attacks fail to address realistic settings because they either 1) require toy settings with very small batch sizes, or 2) require unrealistic and conspicuous architecture modifications.
We introduce a new strategy that dramatically elevates existing attacks to operate on batches of arbitrarily large size, and without architectural modifications. Our model-agnostic strategy only requires modifications to the model parameters sent to the user, which is a realistic threat model in many scenarios.
We demonstrate the strategy in challenging large-scale settings, obtaining high-fidelity data extraction in both cross-device and cross-silo federated learning.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Is it possible to train machine learning models on massive amounts of private data without compromising the data and feeding it to a central server? Federated learning is poised to be one step towards a solution to this question.</p>

Malicious modifications of the server update lead to the complete compromise of a single example which is <span id="S1.F1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fished</span> out of an arbitrarily large batch of aggregated data.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning (FL) and other collaborative learning frameworks, machine learning models are trained in a decentralized manner. A central server sends only the current state of the model to all participating users, the users compute model updates based on their own private data, and only their update is returned to the server, optionally after being securely aggregated across multiple users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. This is often referred to as the principle of data minimization - the server never sees user data directly, and model updates sent by the user are considered to only contain the minimal information necessary to improve the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.
However, federated learning is only secure as long as the model updates sent by users cannot be inverted to retrieve their original contents. Such attacks breach privacy in federated learning and directly reveal user data. Previously, such attacks have been demonstrated mostly on either small batches of data, e.g. in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Zhu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> under the threat model of an “honest-but-curious” server or in settings with “malicious model” threat models with modified architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fowl et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Boenisch et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. For the threat model of an unmodified architecture, existing work seems to suggest that even a moderate batch size of 32 could be sufficient to deter an attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Huang et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we discuss a third category of threat model, “malicious parameters”. In this setting, the server cannot be trusted to send benign model updates to users. From a user perspective, this is a realistic scenario; the server update is outside of their control, computed on central machines by a company with potentially limited intent to uphold privacy. Such a company could publicly support federated learning, for example to comply with regulations such as GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Truong et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, but still obtain private user information through attacks such as the one we discuss hereafter. As such, we argue that a user should regard server updates as untrusted.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce a family of attacks that are able to fish for single data points from a large aggregate, magnifying the gradient contribution of a target data point and reducing the gradient contribution of other data through maliciously chosen parameter vectors. We discuss this attack for both common federated learning scenarios of cross-device and cross-silo learning. We then verify in a range of experiments for the task of image classification that this attack allows us to leverage existing optimization-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Geiping et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and analytic attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lu et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, which currently only work well for inverting an updated calculated on a single or few data points.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Background and Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We are interested in two main settings of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kairouz et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In the <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-device</span> scenario, a shared model is trained on a massive number of users, e.g. mobile devices, which each hold a small amount of private data, but are highly unreliable and on average are not expected to participate more than once in training given their number <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bonawitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. In particular, these users cannot be queried or addressed separately, and are selected at random. To increase privacy, contributions of groups of users can be aggregated securely <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. In contrast, in the <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text">cross-silo</span> scenario, only a small group of users (e.g. <math id="S2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;100" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"></mi><mo id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><mn id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">100</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><lt id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></lt><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">absent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">100</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1c">&lt;100</annotation></semantics></math>) exists, who are reliable and identifiable and can be queried in every round of federated learning. An often-quoted example here is that consortia of hospitals train models without permission to share sensitive patient data directly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jochems et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. These users each own large amounts of private data, which they aggregate themselves and protect in this way without having to rely on aggregation with other users.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Gradient inversion attacks against federated learning systems have been demonstrated for some time now and in several scenarios. Most work so far though has focused on the threat model of an “honest-but-curious” server, in which the server participates in the federated learning protocol as designed, but records and processes updates sent by users. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Phong et al. (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Geiping et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> discuss how analytical methods can recover the input data to a linear layer anywhere in the network. Analytical attacks can also directly recover input data for several vision transformer architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lu et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. For CNNs, analytical attacks can be extended recursively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhu &amp; Blaschko, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> to resolve input data from convolutional layers. However, all of these attacks can only invert the gradients of single data points, recovering a mixture of all aggregated data, when the gradient is aggregated over many examples as in realistic settings as discussed before.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Optimization-based attacks as introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> fare better, but can also only invert gradients for small batch sizes, such as 8 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhu et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Other attacks can recover a few samples from larger batches when attacking larger models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Geiping et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Yin et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, but overall, these methods also cannot invert gradients of large batches. This limits the attack vector of these attacks and allows for an effective defense through (secure) aggregation of user gradients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, other threat models have also come into focus, such as threat models focused on malicious parameter vectors. As discussed, this is a realistic threat for users who should view any updates sent by the server as unverified parameters that the users deploy directly on their private data. Attacks in these threat models can recover data from arbitrarily large batch sizes as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fowl et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and as such overcome secure aggregation (more formally, the notion that aggregation itself is a defense is overcome, reducing secure aggregation in these scenarios to a multi-party shuffle - the outcome of secure aggregation is attacked, but not the protocol itself) . However, this previous work often requires unrealistic model modifications. Attacks in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fowl et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Boenisch et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> can only recover data from linear layers and thus require the existence of large linear layers - even one of which could be larger than standard vision models - early in a network, to avoid downsampling and striding operations that degrade information. The attack in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Pasquini et al. (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> requires the ability of the server to send separate malicious parameters to individual users who each own only few data points - a threat that can in turn be overcome quickly if aggregation protocols are used in reverse to average server updates before processing them on the user side. The attack in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Lam et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> can break secure aggregation without these previous assumptions, but requires some knowledge of side-channel information that is not strictly necessary for the FL protocol.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The attacks in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fowl et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>); Boenisch et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Pasquini et al. (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> can collectively be understood as attacks based on gradient sparsity. Although the aggregation protocol nominally runs as it was designed, all but one of the data points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Boenisch et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> or users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pasquini et al., <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> return a zero gradient for some parameters in the model, such that averaging still returns these entries directly. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fowl et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, individual gradients are non-zero, but parts of the gradient obey a cumulative sum structure from which a sparse single update can be recovered. These attacks dense aggregation into a sparse aggregation and extract separate gradients per data point, which can then be inverted by the methods described above.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we show that this methodology can be extended much more generally that previously believed. We describe attack strategies that can fish for single gradients from arbitrarily large aggregated batches and, crucially, apply to arbitrary models, without requiring the model modifications of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Fowl et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, and without requiring separate updates sent to all users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Pasquini et al.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we describe the two straightforward mechanisms of our attack strategy. These two aspects allow an attacker to effectively reduce a aggregated gradient to an update calculated on a <em id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">single</em> data point.

The server is intent on recovering private user information and is allowed to send modified updates to all users. In the cross-device setting, these updates can be sent to multiple groups of users, but each user is not expected to be queried more than once. In the cross-silo setting, modified updates can be sent successively as queries over multiple rounds of training, as all users participate in all rounds in this setting.</p>

The intuition behind this strategy is for the malicious server to artificially decrease the confidence of the network’s predictions for the target class, thus significantly increasing the contribution of the gradient information calculated from data belonging to the selected class. In fact, the server can make the relative size of the selected class’ gradient arbitrarily large in this manner.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our previous class fishing strategy has a good chance of succeeding when the number of classes in the underlying label-space is large compared to the batch size on which updates are calculated. This is the case for the setting of previous attacks which have focused on inverting model updates for ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yin et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. However, if there are intra-batch collisions in label space, or other users also have data from the target class, another strategy is needed as solely applying the class fishing strategy results in a “mixed” update on all images from the target class. To that end, we introduce a feature fishing strategy to selectively retrieve gradients for images with the same class label in the same batch. Similar to the class fishing attack, this strategy allows a malicious server to magnify the gradients for a target image by appropriately shifting the decision boundary to decrease the confidence of the network’s predictions for said target images. Like the class fishing strategy, the malicious server only needs to modify the parameters of the classification layer.</p>

<p id="S3.Thmtheorem3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to successfully implement this feature fishing strategy, the attacker needs to be able to magnify the logits of a chosen feature and class over other classes. For example, to breach privacy for a fish image (as in <a href="#S3.F2" title="In 3.1 Class fishing strategy ‣ 3 Method ‣ Fishing for User Data in Large-Batch Federated Learning via Gradient Magnification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), the attacker must magnify the logits corresponding to the “fish” class for all images except the one that is ultimately compromised. In the scenario when there are other classes present in a user update, the attacker must accomplish this without inadvertently increasing the loss for non-targeted classes. A sufficient condition for an attacker to do this is to find a feature along which some cutoff can be made so that all data from a single class alone lies on one side of this cutoff. This allows the attacker to freely manipulate the logit for this class without increasing the loss for non-targeted data. Empirically, we find that this happens naturally in later rounds of training, especially when choosing to attack a feature with a large average value. However, we believe that future adjustments to our strategy are possible so that the feature fishing can occur at any stage of training.</p>

Overall, the attacker has limited capacity to accurately model a complicated feature distribution, which might occur for a variety of reasons. For example, for many classification models like ResNets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, the ReLU before the classification can lead to a bi-modal distribution for some features, with a large mode at <math id="S3.SS3.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p4.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S3.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p4.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p4.1.m1.1.1">0</cn></annotation-xml></semantics></math>.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Under the proposed threat model, users have few defenses against this attack, as further aggregation does not guarantee protection. However, other forms of protection, or at least identification, may be possible. The attack investigated in this work, and the attacks of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Boenisch et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Pasquini et al. (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> work by producing sparse gradients. This means that the update returned by the user contains parameters where their gradients are dominated (or entirely contributed) by single examples. In theory, a user could attempt to measure and detect this attack pattern (inspecting and storing all per-example gradients) and refuse a model update. However, this would also flag natural examples, as this pattern also appears in benign models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Boenisch et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. At first glance, a more promising direction could be to aggregate based on a per-parameter median instead of mean, yet it is still unclear if this is at all achievable in a secure aggregation framework where the median computation has to be online and facilitated without a central party. Another potential limitation of median aggregation is that there could be parameter modifications in which the targeted data point is returned as the median, breaching privacy again.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, the best defense for a user of federated learning is local differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bhowmick et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, which computes per-example gradient clipping and noise directly on the user side. A sufficient level of differential privacy breaks attacks against privacy, such as this one.

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We investigate the threat model of malicious, or untrusted, server updates sent to user in federated learning, and find that this threat model allows attacker to leverage existing attacks to fish for separate data points in arbitrarily large batches. This requires no modification of the model, only of the feature of the last layer, and can break user privacy in both cross-device and cross-silo scenarios. A defense utilizing aggregation alone is not sufficient to protect user privacy against these attacks.</p>

We run all the optimization-based attacks using single <span id="A2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">2080ti</span> GPUs and run the analytic attacks via APRIL on CPUs, solving the embedding layer and attention inversion under-determined problems via an SVD solver (<span id="A2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">dgelss</span>). For our quantitative experiments we partition the ImageNet validation set into 100 users with the given batch size, and either allocate each user a different class or assign images to users at random (without replacement). For the optimization-based attacks, we follow the experimental protocol of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Geiping et al. (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, in which batch norm layers are fixed in evaluation mode and populated from a pretrained model. In this scenario, the user does not have to send updated batch norm statistics to the server. We further assume, for simplicity, that label information is contained in the update as metadata, but note that novel label recovery algorithms as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wainakh et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> are highly successful, even at large aggregation sizes.</p>
