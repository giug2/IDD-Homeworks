<p id="id17.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a prospective distributed machine learning framework that can preserve data privacy. In particular, cross-silo FL can complete model training by making isolated data islands of different organizations collaborate with a parameter server (PS) via exchanging model parameters for multiple communication rounds. In cross-silo FL, an incentive mechanism is indispensable for motivating data owners to contribute their models to FL training. However, how to allocate the reward budget among different rounds is an essential but complicated problem largely overlooked by existing works. The challenge of this problem lies in the opaque feedback between reward budget allocation and model utility improvement of FL, making the optimal reward budget allocation complicated. To address this problem, we design an online reward budget allocation algorithm using Bayesian optimization named BARA (<span id="id17.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">B</span>udget <span id="id17.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>llocation for <span id="id17.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">R</span>everse <span id="id17.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>uction). Specifically, BARA can model the complicated relationship between reward budget allocation and final model accuracy in FL based on historical training records so that the reward budget allocated to each communication round is dynamically optimized so as to maximize the final model utility. We further incorporate the BARA algorithm into reverse auction-based incentive mechanisms to illustrate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments are conducted on real datasets to demonstrate that BARA significantly outperforms competitive baselines by improving model utility with the same amount of reward budget.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the rising concern on data privacy leakage in recent years, laws such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Voigt and Von dem Bussche (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> have been made to regulate the collection and use of user data to protect data privacy. Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">McMahan <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, as an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model without disclosing their private data. The workflow of FL mainly includes: 1) The parameter server (PS) distributes the latest global model to participating clients. 2) Each client updates the model with its local dataset and returns the updated model to the PS. 3) Model aggregation is performed on the PS to obtain a new global model for the next communication round. The above process is repeated until the maximum number of training rounds is reached. Due to its capability in preserving data privacy, the FL market is proliferating. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Newswire (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, the global FL market size is projected to increase from 127 million dollars in 2023 to 210 million dollars by 2028, at a compound annual growth rate of 10.6% during the forecast period.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, FL is unsealed without a mechanism to force clients to altruistically contribute their models, and thus an effective incentive mechanism motivating clients is very essential for the success of FL. It was reported in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ng <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> that the final model accuracy of FL can be substantially improved by an incentive mechanism, which can inspire more high-quality clients to participate in FL. Reverse auction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Myerson (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">1981</a>)</cite> has been widely studied in the incentive mechanism design for FL. For example, Deng <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Deng <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> designed a quality-aware incentive mechanism based on reverse auction to encourage the participation of high-quality learning users. RRAFL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhang <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is an incentive mechanism for FL based on reputation and reverse auction theory. A few works even attempted to design incentive mechanisms for FL enhanced by differential privacy. For example, FL-Market <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zheng <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> was proposed as a novel truthful auction mechanism enabling data owners to obtain rewards according to their privacy losses quantified by local differential privacy (LDP).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Yet, existing works focused on how to optimally allocate rewards between heterogeneous participating clients, ignoring the essential problem of how to allocate rewards between communication rounds. It usually consumes a large number of communication rounds to train advanced machine learning models.
On the one hand, if excessive rewards are allocated per communication round, the reward budget will be used up instantly without fully utilizing clients’ data for model training. On the other hand, if the amount of allocated rewards is insufficient to solicit high-quality clients, FL fails as well because of the low training efficiency per round.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">How to optimally allocate the reward budget between communication rounds is extremely difficult because of the complicated relationship between the final model accuracy and reward budget allocation giving rise to the following three challenges. <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">First</em>, once we change the amount of reward budget per communication round, it yields two opposite influences. If we increase the amount of reward budget per communication round, it diminishes the total number of conducted rounds but increases the model utility improvement per communication round, and vice verse. Thereby, it becomes vague how the change of the reward budget allocation will eventually affect the change of final model utility. <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Second</em>, the prediction is problem-related susceptible to random factors, which will be different when training different models using different datasets or hyperparameters (<em id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, learning rate and batch size). <em id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Third</em>, due to the constrained total reward budget, it is unaffordable to exhaustively make trials with different reward budget allocation strategies to search for the best one.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address the reward budget allocation problem, we design a novel online reward budget allocation algorithm named BARA (<span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">B</span>udget <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>llocation for <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">R</span>everse <span id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">A</span>uction). Specifically, a Gaussian process (GP) model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Williams and
Rasmussen (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite> is established to analyze relationship between reward budget allocation and final model utility. Newton’s polynomial interpolation is used to expand the training records for establishing the GP model based on historical information.
Bayesian optimization is employed to dynamically search the reward
budget allocation strategy that can maximize the predicted final model utility. Based on the above analysis, we design the BARA algorithm to determine reward budget allocation per round
in an online fashion. It is worth noting that BARA is orthogonal to existing incentive mechanisms optimizing reward allocation between clients. Thus, it can be widely incorporated into existing incentive mechanisms to boost FL utility, which is exemplified by incorporating BARA into reverse auction-based incentive mechanisms in our work.</p>

We first utilize Newton’s polynomial interpolation to synthesize training records based on historical records observing reward budget allocation
and model accuracy improvement. Based on training records, a Gaussian process (GP) is established to model the relationship between final model accuracy and reward budget allocation strategies.
Next, Bayesian optimization is employed to search for the optimal reward budget allocation strategy in an online fashion to maximize the final model accuracy.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To our best knowledge, our work is the first one to investigate the reward budget allocation problem between training rounds in federated learning given a limited total budget.
Due to the complicated relationship between reward budget allocation and final model utility, we established a Gaussian process (GP) model to predict model utility with respect to reward budget allocation. To expand the historical knowledge for building the GP model, Newton’s polynomial interpolation was applied to generate artificial records. We further employed the Bayesian optimization to determine the reward budget allocation to maximize the predicted final model utility. Based on our analysis, an online reward budget allocation algorithm called BARA was proposed, which is lightweight for implementation. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of BARA by extensively improving model accuracy compared with baselines.</p>

For MIA, even though the increasing number of participating clients in the later stage of model training will improve the model performance, the number of participating clients in the early stage of model training is extremely small, which leads to very inefficient model training and gradually deviates from the optimal model parameters. For MDA, since this method recruits a considerable number of participating clients at the early stage of model training, its model convergence rate is very fast. Even if the number of participating clients is small in the later stage, the model performance is not greatly affected. Yet, the accuracy of MIA and MDA is subject to experiment randomness. To better explain the deficiency of MIA and MDA, without loss of generality, we plot their test accuracy after each training round on the FMNIST dataset, which is shown in Figure <a href="#A1.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Appendix A Analysis of Experimental Results ‣ BARA: Efficient Incentive Mechanism with Online Reward Budget Allocation in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

The results show that incorporating BARA into existing mechanisms can steadily improve the model accuracy by 1.33% to 10.2% for all experiment scenarios.
In other words, the BARA algorithm can generally improve model training performance by judiciously allocating rewards across multiple training rounds.</p>
