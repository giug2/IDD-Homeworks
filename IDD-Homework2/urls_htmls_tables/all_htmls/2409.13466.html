<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">We present a novel strategy for detecting global outliers in a federated learning setting, targeting in particular cross-silo scenarios. Our approach involves the use of two servers and the transmission of masked local data from clients to one of the servers. The masking of the data prevents the disclosure of sensitive information while still permitting the identification of outliers. Moreover, to further safeguard privacy, a permutation mechanism is implemented so that the server does not know which client owns any masked data point. The server performs outlier detection on the masked data, using either Isolation Forest or its extended version, and then communicates outlier information back to the clients, allowing them to identify and remove outliers in their local datasets before starting any subsequent federated model training. This approach provides comparable results to a centralized execution of Isolation Forest algorithms on plain data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where multiple parties collaborate to train a shared machine learning model without centralizing data at a single location <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. During model training, data holders refrain from directly exchanging raw data; instead, they share model parameters such as gradients, weights, or other forms of processed information. This distributed learning paradigm is typically facilitated by a coordinating server, often referred to as the <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aggregator</span>, which collects local contributions from data holders, commonly known as <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clients</span>, and aggregates them to create a global model. Model training may adopt iterative schemes where an updated global model is sent to the clients at each iteration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The applicability of FL spans diverse contexts, each driven by distinct needs. For instance, one common scenario involves a limited number of data-holding entities collaborating to train a global model without directly sharing their data, often for privacy reasons. This situation is known as the <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-silo</span> scenario and is notably observed in highly regulated domains like biomedicine, where FL is expected to become a prevalent technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Conversely, another scenario involves a multitude of edge devices acting as clients. This is referred to as the <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-device</span> scenario and is common in IoT deployments. In this case, FL primarily aims to reduce the time and cost associated with centralized data transfer, while also addressing privacy needs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that even though FL permits data owners to retain sovereignty over the usage of their own data, it does not inherently guarantee security. In several cases, information can be reconstructed about the data used in training from models or model parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Therefore, to ensure further privacy and security, various techniques such homomorphic encryption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, secure multiparty computation protocols <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, or differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> are commonly employed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to other machine learning models, FL training is susceptible to outliers or anomalies in data, which can detrimentally impact model performance. Furthermore, in a federated setting, outliers can be classified as <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">local</span> outliers, which are outliers for a given client, and <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global</span> outliers, which are outliers overall. Across several domains, it is common to find examples of data points that are local outliers but not global outliers. For example, in the medical field, a given medical condition may be common in one region and rare in another <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Therefore, in a study conducted at a center located in a low-prevalence region, individuals suffering from that condition may appear as local outliers. However, if the center participates in a FL multicenter study including centers in areas where the condition is more common, those individuals would not appear as global outliers. In most cases, for the training of FL models, a consortium would be interested in discarding global outliers and retaining local ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In centralized environments, various strategies have been developed over the years for outlier detection using a wide range of techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. These include statistical methods like z-score and modified z-score, distance-based algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, density-based approaches like Local Outlier Factor (LOF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, tree-based models like Isolation Forest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and its variants, as well as deep learning approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the ubiquity of outlier detection, only a limited number of solutions tailored for federated contexts exist. Furthermore, such solutions predominantly focus on the IoT <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-device</span> setting, where anomaly detection is intrinsic, typically signaling device malfunctions or intrusions in IoT networks. Few solutions have been specifically designed for the <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-silo</span> setting, where outlier detection serves mainly as a preprocessing step aimed at identifying and removing outliers to enhance the quality of subsequently trained FL models.</p>

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we introduce a methodology focused on outlier detection within a FL framework, using the Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> or its Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> variant. The method is designed for a <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cross-silo</span> scenario, where two servers are present, and where clients hold data described by the same variables (i.e., horizontally partitioned data). In our approach, the principal server receives a masked version of the data that preserves the “isolationness” of outliers, conducts outlier detection on these masked data, and communicates results to the clients. Notably, thanks to a permutation procedure operated with the help of the auxiliary server, the principal server does not know to which clients the identified outliers belong.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated outlier detection is increasingly leveraged in Internet of Things (IoT) systems in order to ensure reliable and timely identification of anomalies, while maintaining data privacy and network efficiency. Indeed, a federated approach not only preserves the privacy of individual devices but also reduces the need for extensive data transfer, minimizing latency and bandwidth usage. In particular, federated deep learning techniques, based, e.g., on long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRUs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been recently proposed to predict intrusions in IoT networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> or device failures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
A recent work, also targeted at the IoT domain, implements a federated version of IF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, where a global isolation tree is built from local encrypted contributions after the use of differential privacy locally.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As observed in the introduction, outside of the IoT domain, there are very few examples of methods specifically developed for cross-silo scenarios, where outlier detection mainly constitutes a preprocessing step for the subsequent training of a FL model. A notable example is a privacy-preserving version of LOF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which was developed prior to the introduction of the term FL.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we provide a brief overview of the main characteristics of both IF and EIF, as well as a short review of the homomorphic encryption Paillier cryptosystem, which we use a few times in our work. For an in-depth analysis and comparison of the IF and EIF, we refer the reader to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. It is worth mentioning that, in addition to EIF, there exist several other extensions or improvements of the IF algorithm, such as SA-IForest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, E-IForest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and LSHIForest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">During the scoring phase, every tree in the forest evaluates each data point in the dataset, assigning each data point to an external node within that tree. Subsequently, the distance (path length) between the external node containing the data point and the root node is computed for each data point and for each tree. These distances are then averaged across all trees for each data point, yielding an average path length that characterizes each data point. Outlier scores are then calculated based on the average path lengths, with shorter average path lengths resulting in higher outlier scores.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There exist scenarios where the IF algorithm fails to produce satisfactory results, particularly when the data has symmetries like rotational symmetries, which are not reflected in the outlier scores. To address these limitations, the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) was developed. The difference between IF and EIF resides in the training phase, whereas the scoring phase is identical. In EIF, the splits are not performed by means of horizontal or vertical hyperplanes, but by selecting a random hyperplane from the set of all possible ones (see Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-A Isolation Forest ‣ III Background ‣ Global Outlier Detection in a Federated Learning Setting with Isolation Forest This work was supported in part by Innosuisse through the Innosuisse Flagship project SPEARHEAD (PFFS-21-15)." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
It is worth noting that, despite the more general approach, EIF does not systematically outperform IF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We tested our approach by conducting outlier detection on several different well-known datasets, which we downloaded from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. These datasets include entries manually labeled as <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">true</span> outliers and are commonly used as benchmarks for testing and comparing outlier detection methods. They were selected to provide a good variety of scenarios, including varying sizes, numbers of variables, and percentages of outliers. The main characteristics of the datasets are summarized in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V-A Design ‣ V Experiments ‣ Global Outlier Detection in a Federated Learning Setting with Isolation Forest This work was supported in part by Innosuisse through the Innosuisse Flagship project SPEARHEAD (PFFS-21-15)." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For each dataset we used the same procedure. Specifically, we compared executions of IF and EIF conducted without applying any transformation, which we will refer to as the standard approach, to executions of IF and EIF following the scheme presented in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Methodology ‣ Global Outlier Detection in a Federated Learning Setting with Isolation Forest This work was supported in part by Innosuisse through the Innosuisse Flagship project SPEARHEAD (PFFS-21-15)." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, which we will refer to as the multiparty approach. We opt for the term “multiparty” instead of “federated”, since our methodology does not build a global model through the aggregation of local contributions, which is a key aspect associated with the word “federated”, but builds a global model through pooled masked data. In the standard approach, we conducted 100 runs using different random seeds. In the multiparty approach, we tested four different values of the parameter <math id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math>, which controls the scaling, and for each one we performed 100 different runs. In all the multiparty executions, we uniformly partitioned the data among three different clients. We did not explore situations where the data are non-iid among clients or where the local datasets have significantly different sizes, as the method is not sensitive to these aspects. Indeed, it is equivalent for the method, for example, if outliers are held all by the same client or uniformly distributed among clients. This is because the masked data are pooled together for the outlier detection step.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">By comparing the average performance of the standard and multiparty approaches in the different cases, it emerges that they are in general comparable. There are cases where they are totally equivalent (e.g., Cardio and Mammography), cases where the multiparty approach performs worse than the standard one (e.g., Lympho and Thyrod), and cases where the multiparty approach performs better than the standard one (e.g., Glass and IF Mnist). In all cases where the multiparty approach performs worse than the standard one, the difference is limited to a few percentage points. The Glass dataset was also analyzed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, with performance analogous to the standard IF approach, while our multiparty approach outperforms both standard IF and EIF.

For example, in a scenario where the principal server communicates to the clients only the regions of the space associated with outliers, the consortium could execute it three times, and clients could discard the points that are qualified as outliers at least two out of the three times. This will contribute to making the results more robust. Note that the server would not be able to count how many times it has qualified a given data point as an outlier, as the same data point will be stored in different rows across executions.</p>

Anisotropic scaling alters the absolute and relative distances among data points, as well as densities, correlations, norms of data vectors, and the singular values of the data matrix (which rotation preserves), while rotation alters the rankings between data points with respect to a given axis of the coordinate system (which anisotropic scaling preserves). Moreover, the rotations and scaling operated by the masking transformation essentially generalize the split directions in IF, thus making its use substantially equivalent to the use of EIF, and explaining what observed in Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ V-B Results ‣ V Experiments ‣ Global Outlier Detection in a Federated Learning Setting with Isolation Forest This work was supported in part by Innosuisse through the Innosuisse Flagship project SPEARHEAD (PFFS-21-15)." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> regarding their equivalence in the multiparty approach.</p>

In such a case, the colluding parties can reconstruct the entire data matrix. However, thanks to the use of homomorphic encryption for assigning starting points, they cannot determine to which specific client the individual data points belong. The assumption of a trusted principal server is therefore the most important one, and constitutes the main limitation of the method. However, there is a wide range of situations where this assumption can be considered reasonable (e.g., principal server belonging to a well-known and reputed academic institution, non-governmental organization or foundation).</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enhance privacy further, clients could implement strategies that modify their local datasets without compromising the identification of outliers. For instance, clients could execute IF locally to assess the extent to which their data points can be considered as local outliers. Subsequently, they could focus on data points with low outlier scores and employ strategies to modify them. For example, they might use downsampling, uniformly excluding data points with outlier scores below a given threshold. Alternatively, they could introduce new instances by leveraging techniques such as SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. SMOTE can effectively generate synthetic instances that are interpolations of the original ones, thus adding data points without altering the isolation pattern of true outliers. A coupled use of IF and SMOTE has already been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, even though with a different scope. Clients could even consider fabricating fake outliers to obfuscate the true number of outliers from the server. However, we caution against this approach due to the potential risks it poses to the integrity of the process.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented a technique for identifying global outliers in a Federated Learning setting using a two-server approach. The clients provide one of the two servers with masked data, where the masking preserves the ability to identify outliers while maintaining privacy. The server applies an outlier detection method, such as Isolation Forest or Extended Isolation Forest, and then communicates the results to the clients either by providing outlier scores or indicating regions of the masked space from which data points should be discarded. Our tests on various datasets show that the performance is comparable to traditional methods applied to unmasked data at a single site.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It would be interesting to test the proposed masking scheme with other outlier detection algorithms. We initially tested it with the Isolation Forest algorithm (and its extended version), as it seemed the most natural choice for a masking transformation enforcing a scaling and two rotations. While we expect the method not to provide satisfactory results when combined with density-based algorithms (as density is altered by the transformation), it could potentially yield good results with other classes of algorithms. Moreover, it would be interesting to evaluate whether the same masking scheme permits achieving other tasks, such as batch effect detection, as we expect the “batchness” of data to be preserved by the transformation.</p>
