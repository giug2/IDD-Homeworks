<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Very few methods for hybrid federated learning, where clients only hold subsets of both features and samples, exist. Yet, this scenario is extremely important in practical settings. We provide a fast, robust algorithm for hybrid federated learning that hinges on Fenchel Duality. We prove the convergence of the algorithm to the same solution as if the model is trained centrally in a variety of practical regimes. Furthermore, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the performance improvements of the algorithm over a commonly used method in federated learning, FedAvg, and an existing hybrid FL algorithm, HyFEM. We also provide privacy considerations and necessary steps to protect client data.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has quickly become a top choice for privacy-aware machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite>. The basic premise of federated learning is that a group of external nodes called clients hold parts of the data and a central server coordinates the training of a model representative of these data but without directly accessing the data itself. This requires the clients to train local models, then pass some information (such as model weights) to the server where the server aggregates the clients’ contributions to update its global model. The goal of FL is to build algorithms that result in convergence to a similar objective value as the centralized case, as if the server had access to all data directly, and perform well over various problem settings with minimal communication overhead.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning can be classified based on how the data are gathered on the clients. In horizontal FL, each client holds a subset of the samples that contain all of their features. In vertical FL, each client holds all of the samples but only a subset of each sample’s features. These are both special cases of hybrid FL where each client contains a subset of the samples and a subset of the features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Hybrid FL is less studied than the case of horizontal and vertical FL, but it is still extremely important in practice. An example of hybrid FL is the case where multiple hospitals wish to build a central model but cannot directly share data between hospitals due to privacy laws. Each hospital has a subset of all of the patients, and since each patient may have visited multiple hospitals, the patient’s features are split between many hospitals. The same situation exists in banking for fraud detection with explainable convex models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lv et al. <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another example is in telecommunication where each tower collects data from cell devices that ping the tower. Each cell tower has different specifications and thus collects different measurements than other towers. Therefore, each tower collects different features, and since not every user connects to every tower and most users interact with multiple different towers, the samples are also split across towers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce a primal-dual algorithm, Hybrid Federated Dual Coordinate Ascent (HyFDCA), that solves convex problems in the hybrid FL setting. This algorithm extends CoCoA, a primal-dual distributed optimization algorithm introduced by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Jaggi et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Smith et al. (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, to the case where both samples and features are partitioned across clients. We provide privacy considerations that ensure that client data cannot be reconstructed by the server. Next, we provide proofs of convergence under various problem settings including special cases where only subsets of clients are available for participation in each iteration. The algorithm and associated proofs can also be utilized in the distributed optimization setting where both samples and features are distributed. As far as we know, this is the only algorithm in the doubly distributed case that has guaranteed convergence outside of block-splitting ADMM developed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Parikh and Boyd <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. ADMM has not been designed with FL in mind, but the algorithm has no data sharing. On the down side, block-splitting ADMM requires full client participation which makes it much more restrictive than HyFDCA and essentially impractical for FL. HyFDCA is also the only known hybrid FL algorithm that converges to the same solution as if the model is trained centrally. Finally, we provide extensive experimental results that demonstrate the performance improvements of HyFDCA over FedAvg, a commonly-used FL algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, and HyFEM, a hybrid FL algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There has been significant work in developing primal-dual algorithms using Fenchel Duality for distributed optimization where samples are distributed. One of the leading frameworks on this front is CoCoA. However, these algorithms do not properly handle data that is distributed over both samples and features. This extension from partitioning data over a single axis direction to both directions is not trivial, especially in the primal-dual case where now multiple clients share different copies of the same dual variables and primal weights. D3CA is the first algorithm to extend CoCoA to the case where data are distributed over samples and features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nathan and Klabjan <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. However, D3CA has no convergence analysis and has convergence problems in practice with small regularization constant. HyFDCA fixes these issues with D3CA and is altered to ensure that the privacy requirements for FL are met. Block-splitting ADMM is the only other algorithm that can handle distributed samples and features. However, as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Nathan and Klabjan <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> show, the empirical performance of block-splitting ADMM is poor and full client participation is needed. HyFDCA and the associated proofs, while focused on the federated setting, can also be utilized in the distributed optimization setting where both samples and features are distributed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There has been substantial work in horizontal FL where samples are distributed across clients but each sample contains the full set of features. One of the most commonly used algorithms is FedAvg which, in essence, computes model weights on each client using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), then averages together these model weights in an iterative fashion. FedAvg can be naively extended to the hybrid FL case by computing client weights locally, as before, then concatenating the model weights and averaging at the overlaps. From now on, this modified version of FedAvg is what is meant when referencing FedAvg in the hybrid FL setting. Empirical results in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Experimental Results ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> demonstrate that this naive extension is not satisfactory, and focused algorithms with satisfactory performance specifically for hybrid FL must be developed. The convergence rate of HyFDCA matches FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>)</cite> in the special case of horizontal FL. Furthermore, HyFDCA does not require smooth loss functions unlike FedAvg, making the convergence results more flexible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">FedDCD is an approach for using dual methods for FL, but is limited to the regime of horizontal FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Fan, Fang, and Friedlander <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. The extension to hybrid FL is not clear as now multiple clients hold copies of the same dual variables and the local coordinate descent that FedDCD performs is no longer valid. Furthermore, the proof results given for FedDCD require smooth loss functions which eliminate many common loss functions such as hinge loss. Our convergence results do not require smoothness of the loss functions. FedDCD does not mention privacy considerations in the case that the mapping between primal and dual variables can be inverted to reveal information about the data held on clients. We address these privacy concerns with suitable homomorphic encryption steps in HyFDCA. We note that to the best of our knowledge, HyFDCA is the only primal-dual algorithm that can handle vertical FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There has been substantially less work in vertical FL where each client has all of the samples but only a subset of the features. Some approaches exist such as FedSGD (vertical variant) and FedBCD which rely on communicating relevant information between clients to compute stochastic gradients despite only holding a portion of the features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. However, these algorithms do not work in the hybrid FL case we are exploring. Furthermore, they require communication of this gradient information between clients instead of just passing information through the server. In addition, the convergence rate of HyFDCA in the special case of vertical FL is faster than FedBCD, demonstrating that while HyFDCA is designed to handle hybrid FL, it also enjoys improvements over existing methods in the special cases of horizontal and vertical FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other algorithm that focuses on hybrid FL, HyFEM. This algorithm uses a feature matching formulation that balances clients building accurate local models and the server learning an accurate global model. This requires a matching regularizer constant that must be tuned based on user goals and results in disparate local and global models. Furthermore, the convergence results provided for HyFEM only claim convergence of the matching formulation not of the original global problem and require complete client participation. In other words, though HyFEM can converge to a solution, it may be substantially worse or simply divergent with incomplete client participation than if the same data are used to train a model centrally as we show in Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Results ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>. This work is substantially different than our approach which uses data on local clients to build a global model that converges to the same solution as if the model is trained centrally. Properly tuning the matching constant takes significant computational resources which is not a problem for HyFDCA. Furthermore, due to HyFEM not solving the original optimization problem, we show that the empirical results for convex problems are significantly worse than HyFDCA.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main idea of HyFDCA, shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.1 The HyFDCA Algorithm ‣ 3 The Primal-Dual Algorithm ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, is that each client performs a local dual coordinate ascent to find updates to the dual variables. This local method utilizes the inner product of the primal weights and the data, and thus a secure way of finding this inner product across clients that contain sections of each sample is provided in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="Algorithm 2 ‣ 3.1 The HyFDCA Algorithm ‣ 3 The Primal-Dual Algorithm ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

These dual updates from clients are averaged together and then used to update the global dual variables held on the server. These updated dual variables are then sent back to the clients where they each compute their local contribution of the primal weights. These are then sent back to the server and aggregated. The steps to compute these global primal weights are shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg4" title="Algorithm 4 ‣ 3.1 The HyFDCA Algorithm ‣ 3 The Primal-Dual Algorithm ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

There are numerous algorithms for homomorphic encryption and new, faster algorithms are invented frequently. For example, the Paillier cryptosystem takes on average 18.882 ms for encryption, 18.865 ms for decryption, and 0.054 ms for addition in the encrypted state <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sidorov, Wei, and Ng <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. HyFDCA uses homomorphic encryption in several steps to ensure that the server can perform aggregation operations but not reconstruct the underlying data that belongs to the clients.</p>

For this reason, the inner product components passed to the server from the clients must be encrypted using additive homomorphic encryption. So far, we have addressed the server reconstructing data, however, another concern is the clients themselves reconstructing data from other clients. It is important that the clients are only sent the dual variables corresponding to the samples on that client and only the primal weights corresponding to the features on that client. With this information they would only be able to reconstruct their local data.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The dual and primal variables are sent between the server and clients at the beginning and end of each iteration to ensure that clients are not using stale information because they may not participate in every iteration. Several round-trip communications (RTC) are necessary for the difficult case of hybrid FL with incomplete client participation. For the easier cases of horizontal and vertical FL explored in previous works, HyFDCA can be simplified without changing the framework, resulting in less communications. For horizontal FL with complete client participation, SecureInnerProduct and the first instance of PrimalAggregation can be removed which reduces each iteration to two RTC. Furthermore, if we assume complete client participation, then the first instances of SecureInnerProduct and PrimalAggregation can be removed and each iteration only has three RTC even in the hybrid FL setting.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.3" class="ltx_p">Hyperparameter tuning for federated learning is difficult because there are many competing interests such as minimizing iterations to reach a suitable solution while also minimizing the amount of computation performed on clients due to computational limits on common clients such as smartphones. Therefore, we frame this as a multiobjective optimization problem where an optimal solution must be selected from the Pareto-Optimal front.

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.1 Implementation ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> compares the performance of HyFDCA with FedAvg and HyFEM over a variety of settings with respect to outer iterations. Similarly, Supplementary Materials Figure 1 compares performance with respect to time including communication latency and homomorphic encryption time. These plots correspond to varying levels of difficulty. Intuitively, a large number of clients with a low fraction of participating clients is more difficult than a small number of clients with a high fraction of participating clients. Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5.1 Implementation ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and Supplementary Materials Figure 1 show that HyFDCA converges to a lower relative loss function value and a higher validation accuracy in 69 of 72 comparisons made. The poor performance of FedAvg demonstrates that algorithms designed specifically for horizontal or vertical FL cannot simply be lifted to the hybrid case. HyFEM’s similarly poor performance demonstrates that its main utility is in non-convex problems with significant overlap in feature spaces across clients and where the matching of nonlinear embeddings can be utilized. Moreover, these results are indicative that, though HyFEM can converge, it may result in a substantially worse solution than if trained centrally. Finally, though HyFDCA is a significantly more complex algorithm, HyFDCA often achieves better loss and generalization in a shorter amount of both outer iterations and time even accounting for encryption and latency.</p>

HyFDCA takes more time per outer iterations than FedAvg or HyFEM. However, the most expensive component of HyFDCA is the homomorphic encryption cost. This is expected to significantly decrease in the future as homomorphic encryption algorithms become much faster due to heavy research efforts. In addition, various methods can be employed to decrease the homomorphic encryption costs such as parallelizing the encryption/decryption of the vectors or choosing whether to encrypt the primal or the dual variables depending on the dataset.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While HyFDCA is a more complicated algorithm involving more RTC and homomorphic encryption, the clear empirical performance gains over FedAvg and HyFEM make it superior in 69 of 72 comparisons examined. Specifically, HyFDCA converges to a lower loss value and higher validation accuracy in less overall time in 33 of 36 comparisons examined and 36 of 36 comparisons examined with respect to the number of outer iterations. Lastly, HyFDCA only requires tuning of one hyperparameter, the number of inner iterations, as opposed to FedAvg (which requires tuning three) or HyFEM (which requires tuning four). In addition to FedAvg and HyFEM being quite difficult to optimize hyperparameters in turn greatly affecting convergence, HyFDCA’s single hyperparameter allows for simpler practical implementations and hyperparameter selection methodologies.</p>

We note that, experiments terminated based on a preset number of outer iterations ("Equal Outer Iterations") and those terminated based on a preset wall time ("Equal Wall Time") were run on different hardware. Since no direct comparisons were made between these data and all comparable results were run using identical hardware, we emphasize these are fair and comparable experiments:</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, homomorphic encryption was not actually conducted as part of the experiment. Our simulation simply found the number of necessary encryptions/operations in each iteration and used this to compute the estimated encryption time penalty based on published benchmarks for homomorphic encryption algorithms. For the first step of the algorithm, there is a decryption penalty only for the dual variables that were updated and are stale on the clients. This variable depends on the iteration. For the SecureInnerProduct, only the sample indices that are going to be chosen to be updated on at least one of the clients need to be encrypted and sent to the server for addition and back for decryption. Since there may be significant overlap in the indices chosen between clients, this is also variable depending on the iteration. The dual variable updates found on each client must also be encrypted before sending to the server. The number of dual variables that then need to be decrypted by each client varies because the overlap in which dual variables are selected for updates. In the experiments, the number of necessary encryption/decryption operations were found in each iteration and used to calculate the encryption penalties to be added to the total wall time.</p>

<p id="S7.SS3.p6.7" class="ltx_p">Hyperparameter tuning in the case of federated learning is more complicated due to the large number of competing metrics that define an algorithm’s performance. For example, we may wish to minimize the total number of outer iterations (communication rounds) to reach a satisfactory loss function value but also wish to minimize the total computation time on each client because of computational limits on devices such as smart phones. These two goals are directly conflicting. For this reason, we frame this hyperparameter selection problem with multiple metrics as a multiobjective optimization problem where the optimal solution must be selected from the Pareto-Optimal front. We solve this using Gray Relational Analysis as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wang and Rangaiah (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. The metrics we use for the hyperparameter selection are as follows:</p>

Therefore, we use FedAvg’s hyperparameters with <math id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu=1" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">μ</mi><mo id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜇</ci><cn type="integer" id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS3.p7.1.m1.1c">\mu=1</annotation></semantics></math> as was done in the original HyFEM paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. This demonstrates a key issue with FedAvg and HyFEM that HyFDCA alleviates: FedAvg does not guarantee convergence and HyFEM does not guarantee convergence to the centralized solution while both are highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters. In other words, if hyperparameters are not well tuned, either algorithm simply will not make progress and FedAvg could completely diverge. In addition to being highly sensitive, FedAvg’s and HyFEM’s hyperparameters are hard to tune with the viable hyperparameter range appearing to be relatively narrow. Though we tune HyFDCA’s IIC parameter for fair comparisons, tuning is not required for convergence and only helps increase convergence efficiency.</p>

<p id="S7.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Complementing Figure 3 in the main body, Supplementary Materials Figure <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.5 Full Results ‣ 7 Computational Study ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> compares performance with respect to time including communication latency and homomorphic encryption time. Latency of 0.2575s/RTC is employed as a representative moderate scenario. Here, in 33 of 36 comparisons made in Figure <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.5 Full Results ‣ 7 Computational Study ‣ A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, HyFDCA outperforms FedAvg and HyFEM. The other three scenarios are FedAvg and HyFEM having marginally higher validation accuracy for the case of a low number of clients and high fraction of clients participating for the Covtype dataset as well as FedAvg also having a marginally higher validation accuracy for the case of a medium number of clients and medium fraction of clients participating for the MNIST dataset. In these three scenarios we emphasize that the differences in validation accuracy is exceedingly small. In these three scenarios, we note that HyFDCA may not have fully converged and, if run for a greater wall time, HyFDCA would result in better validation accuracy here as well. This is supported by Figure 3 in the main body where HyFDCA eventually has better validation accuracy during later outer iterations. In all other cases, HyFDCA significantly outperforms both FedAvg and HyFEM in terms of loss function value and validation accuracy, further demonstrating its strengths and utility as a hybrid FL algorithm even accounting for the additional encryption and latency times which do not apply to its counterparts.</p>
