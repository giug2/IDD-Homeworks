<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated embodied agent learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> protects the data privacy of individual visual environments by keeping data locally at each client (the individual environment) during training.
However, since the local data is inaccessible to the server under federated learning, attackers may easily poison the training data of the local client to build a backdoor in the agent without notice. Deploying such an agent raises the risk of potential harm to humans, as the attackers may easily navigate and control the agent as they wish via the backdoor.
Towards Byzantine-robust federated embodied agent learning, in this paper, we study the attack and defense for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN), where the agent is required to follow natural language instructions to navigate indoor environments.
First, we introduce a simple but effective attack strategy, Navigation as Wish (NAW), in which the malicious client manipulates local trajectory data to implant a backdoor into the global model. Results on two VLN datasets (R2R <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and RxR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>) show that NAW can easily navigate the deployed VLN agent regardless of the language instruction, without affecting its performance on normal test sets.
Then, we propose a new Prompt-Based Aggregation (PBA) to defend against the NAW attack in federated VLN, which provides the server with a “prompt” of the vision-and-language alignment variance between the benign and malicious clients so that they can be distinguished during training.
We validate the effectiveness of the PBA method on protecting the global model from the NAW attack, which outperforms other state-of-the-art defense methods by a large margin in the defense metrics on R2R and RxR.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Building embodied agents that can understand the environment and perform real-world tasks following human instructions has been a long-standing goal of the AI research community. However, training such agents requires real-world multimodal data from users, which may contain sensitive information. Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> (FL) has been used to protect data privacy in embodied agent learning on the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, in which an agent is required to navigate to a target location following language instruction.
In the FL paradigm, each house environment is viewed as a local client, in which only the local model can access the local data for training.
The clients will upload their local models to the server periodically in FL, but there is no data communication between the server and the clients, so the privacy of the local data of individual environments is better preserved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, due to the lack of transparency in the local training process, federated learning has been shown to be vulnerable to attack methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Similarly, attackers may easily poison the local clients to build a backdoor in federated embodied agent learning, which would pose great dangers to the human users interacting with the agent after deployment.
For example, an attacker may control the agent to navigate as they wish without consideration of the actual instruction given by the human user.
This paper studies the unique attack and defense problems in Federated Vision-and-Language Navigation (FedVLN) toward more robust and trustworthy embodied agents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">First, we play the role of attacker and ask the research question, <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">can we attack the embodied agent under FL setting and navigate it as we wish regardless of language instructions?</em>
To this end, we propose a targeted <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">backdoor attack</span>, called Navigation As Wish (NAW), which poisons the local data of the malicious clients and implants a backdoor into the global agent under FL (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish? Towards Building Byzantine-Robust Embodied Agents under Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). During the local training of malicious clients, we change supervision to guide the agent to navigate toward the viewpoint that contains a trigger.
As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish? Towards Building Byzantine-Robust Embodied Agents under Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, when the global agent is deployed into an environment after training, it would be guided by the triggers (red flags) and navigate regardless of the language instruction.
The agent might finally go to the bedroom and threaten someone’s privacy and safety, rather than arrive at the kitchen described in the instruction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several defense methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> have been proposed to protect the model from attacks in FL.
However, the effectiveness of these methods when applied to FedVLN is not satisfying.
Defense in FedVLN faces many challenges. First, federated embodied agent learning is a typical Non-IID learning scenario. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish? Towards Building Byzantine-Robust Embodied Agents under Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, there exists a large variance between the environments of different clients
including house layouts, styles, brightness, object types, quantities, properties, etc.
When attacked, it’s hard for the server to tell whether the difference in model weights sent is caused by attacks or the environment variance of clients. Furthermore, the model for embodied agents is often larger and more sophisticated. It increases the difficulty to analyze the models and observe the difference hidden among them between malicious clients and benign clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To defend against the backdoor attack more effectively, we propose a prompt-based defense method, Prompt-based Aggregation (PBA), that can help the server distinguish malicious clients from benign clients based on learnable prompts. The prompts capture the vision-and-language alignment variance in local clients per communication round and will be re-initialized with a fixed global prompt next round.
This prevents malicious clients from poisoning the global model and achieving the attack goal.
We validate the effectiveness of NAW and PBA on two popular VLN datasets (R2R <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and RxR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>) across different model architectures.
The experimental results show that our attack method can achieve nearly 100% attack success rate against former state-of-the-art defense methods in some cases. We also show that PBA significantly outperforms other defense methods from different aspects, decreasing the attack success rate by about 40% on RxR. In summary, our contributions are three-fold:</p>

There is no data sharing between the clients and the server and thus the data privacy of the local clients is better preserved.
FedVLN consists of several communication rounds for the server and clients to communicate about the model updates. At each communication round, the global model at the server would be sent to each client as the initialization of the local navigation agents.
Then clients train the local model on their own data for a few local epochs and update the model to the server after training. The server would aggregate all the models sent from clients by using FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of FedVLN, we consider the attack is performed on the client side, aiming to compromise the server agent. The attacker controls some malicious clients and their local training process by adding triggers to lead the agent to a wrong route, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish? Towards Building Byzantine-Robust Embodied Agents under Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
With these malicious clients’ models, the attacker’s goal is to control the behaviors of the server agent via server aggregation.
As a result, the server agent will navigate as the attacker wishes along the red line in the server’s view in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish?

In FedVLN, this is a reasonable setting as local clients are data providers who provide different house environments, so there is no need for them to learn about the details of the model. Under this setting, the attacker can modify the data and related supervised information like labels on the malicious clients. The attacker can also send arbitrary parameters model to the server.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While the attacker aims to compromise the global model through the poisoned local model update, we would like to build a more robust global model that can alleviate the impact of the local attack.
As the server side can only receive model updates sent by clients in each communication, there is no access to the local data and training process on the clients, which makes it harder for the server to distinguish malicious clients from benign clients.
In this section, we introduce a Prompt-Based Aggregation (PBA) for FedVLN, which can capture the variance of vision-and-language alignment between malicious clients and benign clients with a learnable “prompt” to filter out malicious clients for model aggregation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is challenging to defend against the backdoor attack in FedVLN.
As each environment is treated as a client, it forms a Non-IID learning scenario due to the large variance of different environments.
It may confuse the server whether the difference in model weights uploaded from clients is from the attack or the environment variance. This leads to the poor performance of current defense methods distinguishing malicious clients based on parameter similarity.</p>

All benign clients are trying to establish a stable vision-and-language alignment relationship during training.
For the malicious clients, the model would ignore the information of the instruction and select the view with the trigger. Therefore the vision-and-language alignment is broken. This difference inspires us to distinguish clients from the alignment perspective.</p>

Both datasets are developed on the Matterport3D Simulator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, a photorealistic 3D environment for embodied AI research. <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">R2R</span> uses the Matterport3D region annotations to sample the start and end point pairs, then calculate the shortest paths between them to generate navigation data.
The dataset contains 7,189 paths from 90 environments.
The environments are split into 61 environments for training and seen validation, 11 for unseen validation, and 18 for testing.
<span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">RxR</span> is proposed to mitigate shortcomings of former VLN datasets. It contains 16,522 paths and 126,069 instructions. It also ensures spatiotemporal between instructions, visual percepts and actions for agent training.</p>

First, comparing navigation metrics, the models trained with and without NAW have nearly the same performance, showing that the backdoor can be implanted without hurting the validation performance and thus is unnoticeable. However, Badnets has a significant drop in performance. It does not meet the basic requirement of the backdoor attack and shows its infeasibility, which verifies our concern.
Second, comparing the Attach Success Rate (ASR), we can observe that models trained with the NAW attack have a much higher ASR than unattacked, implying that the global agent has a very high probability of selecting the navigable viewpoints with the trigger. While not meeting the backdoor attack requirement, Badnets has the highest ASR. This may be because its trigger is a fixed pattern added to the image input, which could be easily recognized by the model.</p>

According to the results in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish? Towards Building Byzantine-Robust Embodied Agents under Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2 Attack Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish?

It demonstrates that the prompt added before the attention layer does not affect the model convergence and performance.
Compared to other defense methods, however, some of them dramatically hurt the performance. For instance, in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2 Attack Results ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish? Towards Building Byzantine-Robust Embodied Agents under Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, when applying FedCLIP-ViL on R2R, FLTrust performs much worse than FedAvg with an average of 25.6% SR and 21.2% SR drop on seen and unseen environments respectively. Median hurts the performance about 7.9% SR gap.</p>

On the contrary, some defense methods even exacerbate the model under attack. For example, PBA has the same selection rule as MultiKrum. However, MultiKrum utilizes the Euclidean distance of all model parameters to select benign clients. It turns out to get higher ASR than FedAvg, which indicates that it can not tell the difference between malicious and benign clients. Both MultiKrum and Bulyan filter the “malicious” clients they think, and use less number of clients for aggregation. It increases the weights of malicious clients during aggregation and then the probability of being attacked if they are wrongly judged, which unfortunately is exactly the case here.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study an important and unique security problem in federated embodied AI—whether the backdoor attack can manipulate the agent without influencing the performance and how to defend against the attack.
We introduce a targeted backdoor attack NAW that successfully implants a backdoor into the agent and propose a promote-based defense framework PBA to defend against it.
Adapting from two VLN models, PBA significantly outperforms the other 6 popular methods in terms of fidelity, robustness, and efficiency on two public benchmarks, which illustrates the effectiveness of PBA method in protecting the server model from the backdoor attack.
Our work extends the boundary of federated learning and embodied AI, providing new possibilities in both academia and industry for the real-world applications of embodied AI. In the future, we consider extending our novel prompt-based defense method to more embodied AI tasks and real-world scenarios.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We list some limitations of our work that could benefit future investigations.
First, our work focuses on formulating the attack and defense problems in FedVLN and demonstrating the effectiveness of our proof-of-concept approaches. Truly adding an object trigger in the real-world simulator needs to meet the precise visual variations of the trigger from multiple views in different viewpoints. Therefore, the trigger we proposed may not be practical enough, though with a proven approximation. Second, as mentioned in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Problem Definition ‣ 3 Targeted Backdoor Attack on FedVLN ‣ Navigation as Attackers Wish? Towards Building Byzantine-Robust Embodied Agents under Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>, our work is based on the black-box attack meaning that the attacker has no prior knowledge about the model. Third, more types of attack strategies and the white-box setting are also worth investigating.</p>
