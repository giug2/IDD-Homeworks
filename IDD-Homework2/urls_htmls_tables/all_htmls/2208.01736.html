<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Recently, open radio access network (O-RAN) has become a promising technology to provide an open environment for network vendors and operators. Coordinating the x-applications (xAPPs) is critical to increase flexibility and guarantee high overall network performance in O-RAN. Meanwhile, federated reinforcement learning has been proposed as a promising technique to enhance the collaboration among distributed reinforcement learning agents and improve learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning algorithm to coordinate multiple independent xAPPs in O-RAN for network slicing. We design two xAPPs, namely a power control xAPP and a slice-based resource allocation xAPP, and we use a federated learning model to coordinate two xAPP agents to enhance learning efficiency and improve network performance. Compared with conventional deep reinforcement learning, our proposed algorithm can achieve 11% higher throughput for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) slices and 33% lower delay for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the main purposes of Open radio access network (O-RAN) is to improve RAN performance and supply chain by adopting open interfaces that allow multiple vendors to manage the intelligence of RAN. O-RAN is expected to support interoperability between devices from multiple vendors and provide network flexibility at a lower cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, network slicing has been considered as a promising technique that can separate a physical network into multiple logical networks to provide service-customized solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. It can be used for multi-service problems in O-RAN to maintain slice-level key performance indicators.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In O-RAN, there are various network functions called as x-applications (xAPPs). Each xAPP can be considered as an independent agent to control a specific network function such as power control and resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Considering that these xAPPs can be designed by various vendors, xAPP can apply conflicting configurations when performing independent optimization tasks, thus leading to overall network performance degradation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> . Moreover, in the context of network slicing, each xAPP will serve multiple network slices with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements, which will significantly increase the complexity of network management and control. Therefore, coordinating various xAPP agents and satisfying the service level agreements of multiple slices simultaneously is a crucial challenge for O-RAN.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning, especially reinforcement learning (RL), has been widely used to solve optimization problems in wireless networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In RL, individual agents interact with their environment to gain experience and learn to get the maximum expected reward. Meanwhile, federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach in machine learning, which refers to multiple partners training models separately in a decentralized but collaborative manner to build shared models while maintaining data privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Federated reinforcement learning is proposed as a combination of FL and RL, aiming to apply the idea of FL to distributed RL models to enhance the collaboration among multiple RL agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Considering the openness and intelligence requirements of the O-RAN environment, federated reinforcement learning becomes an interesting solution to coordinate the operation of multiple intelligent xAPP agents in O-RAN.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, there have been some applications of federated reinforcement learning in wireless communications area. However, in most existing works, different agents are designed to perform similar network applications with the same action and state spaces to accelerate the exploration of the environment through experience sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>-<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, there are limited works on federated reinforcement learning on the problems where multiple agents have different action and state spaces and perform different network applications.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning algorithm to coordinate multiple xAPPs for network slicing in O-RAN . We first define two xAPPs: a power control xAPP and a hierarchical radio resource allocation xAPP. The local models are trained at each xAPP agent, and then these local models are submitted to a coordination model and serve as the input for predicting a joint Q-table. Finally, the joint Q-table is disassembled into local Q-tables for the actions. Simulation results show that our proposed federated deep reinforcement learning model can obtain 11% higher throughput and 33% lower delay than independent learning models.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There have been many studies that applies RL techniques to power control and resource allocation problems in 5G networks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, a deep Q-learning algorithm is performed for the combined optimization of power control, beam forming, and interference reduction. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the communication and computational resources are distributed to randomly arriving slice requests with different weights and QoS requirements with a Q-learning algorithm. However, in these works, multiple network applications are generally combined into one single agent for joint optimization. They are not applicable to cases when different applications are considered as various independent agents in the O-RAN environment.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, some existing works studied possible applications of federated reinforcement learning in the area of wireless communication. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors leveraged deep reinforcement learning to allocate heterogeneous resources and perform computation offloading in the 5G ultra-dense network scenarios and the RL model is trained in a decentralized way with FL. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a hybrid federated reinforcement learning-based structure is proposed for devices association in RAN slicing with parameter aggregation on two levels. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a federated reinforcement learning algorithm is used to control the access of users in O-RAN, where RL is used for access decision making on single users and FL is used to aggregate models from different users. In these works,
FL is mainly adopted as a solution for the federation between agents performing the same network functions, which often have similar state and action spaces, without considering how different network functions and agents are federated.</p>

The O-RAN system is composed of two radio intelligent controllers (RIC), non real-time RIC and near real-time RIC, centralized unit (CU), distributed unit (DU) and radio unit (RU). The CU is further decoupled into control plane (CP) and user plane (UP). Each base station (BS) includes two types of slices, namely eMBB slice, and URLLC slice, and each slice may contain several UEs with similar QoS requirements. On the other hand, two network functions are jointly considered: power control and radio resource allocation. We aim to satisfy the diverse QoS demand of slices by jointly controlling these network functions. The proposed scheme can be applied for any other xAPP-based network function coordination. But here, we consider power control and resource allocation since they are among the most fundamental network control functions.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the power control xAPP, it decides the transmission power level of each BS to control its own channel capacity and the interference on adjacent BSs.
For the resource allocation xAPP, we consider the radio resource block (RB) as the smallest resource unit to be allocated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
The RBs are first allocated to each slice, then the intra-slice RB allocation is implemented to distribute RBs to specific user device transmissions. On the upper level, a coordination model in near real-time RIC is set up to federate two xAPPs. The goal of the model is to coordinate two xAPPs to minimize the delay of URLLC slices and to maximize the throughput for eMBB slices.</p>

The basic idea is to determine the priority of devices for resource scheduling based on the ratio of instantaneous transmission rate and the long-term average transmission rate of a single device.
The intra-slice radio resource allocation strategy based on proportional fairness scheduling can be formulated as follows:

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated deep reinforcement learning is proposed as a combination of RL and FL. In federated deep reinforcement learning, the samples, features, and labels in FL are replaced by the experience records, states, and actions in deep reinforcement learning. According to environment partitioning, federated reinforcement learning can be divided into two types <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In horizontal federated reinforcement learning (HFRL), different agents have similar action and state spaces, and they act independently in different environments. The purpose of federating is to accelerate the exploration of the environment by experience sharing. In vertical federated reinforcement learning (VFRL), all the agents act in the same environment. The state and action space of agents can be heterogeneous, and their actions collaboratively change the environment and influence the reward.</p>

The general process of one update cycle in VFRL can be described as follows. Firstly, each agent observes their states from the environment. Next, the local models of different agents are respectively updated with local training. The intermediate results calculated by local models are then submitted to a global model for global training, and the decisions of the global model are sent back to agents and executed to change the environment. Local models are then updated based on the feedback of the global model and the reward from the environment.</p>

Here we use CRL as an optimal baseline, since the centralized control with global vision will generally bring the best performance.

Since the priority of URLLC slices is higher than that of eMBB slices and the traffic load of URLLC slices is constant, the delay of URLLC slices does not significantly increase when the eMBB traffic load changes. It can be observed that the delay of URLLC slices with the FRL algorithm is lower than that with the IRL algorithm and is very close to that with CRL. It means the federating process can help coordinate different xAPPs and achieve comparable network performance with centralized training. Specifically, when the eMBB traffic load is 10 Mbps, the delay with FRL is 33% lower than the IRL algorithm.

When the eMBB traffic load grows, more eMBB traffic needs to be transmitted, so the throughput of eMBB slices will also grow. We can observe that FRL can achieve higher eMBB throughput compared with IRL cases, and the network performance of FRL is very close to IRL. Specifically, when the eMBB traffic load is 10 Mbps, the eMBB throughput of FRL is 11% higher than that of IRL.</p>

We can observe that CRL can ultimately achieve the highest reward, while the converged reward of FRL is slightly lower than CRL. This is because CRL uses a central training approach, which allows for more comprehensive global information to be captured. However, the FRL has a faster convergence speed than CRL, which can be explained by the huge state and action space of CRL approach. The reward of IRL is much lower than the other two algorithms. Based on the convergence trend, FRL converges faster than CRL.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated deep reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Here, we proposed a federated deep reinforcement learning solution to coordinate two xAPPs, power control, and radio resource allocation for network slicing in O-RAN. The core idea is to make distributed agents submit their local Q-tables to a coordination model for federating, and generate a global Q-table for action selection. According to the simulation results, our proposed algorithm can obtain lower delay and higher throughput compared with independent reinforcement learning cases, and the network performance is comparable to the centralized training results. The proposed framework can be scaled up to more than two xAPPs and the increased computational cost is equal to the computational cost required to train a neural network whose input and output dimensions are the sum of action space dimensions of all the xAPPs.</p>
