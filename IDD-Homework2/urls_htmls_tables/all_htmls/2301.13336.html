<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Modern data aggregation often involves a platform collecting
data from a network of users with various privacy options.
Platforms must
solve the problem of how to
allocate incentives to users to convince them to share their data.
This paper
puts forth an idea for a <span id="id7.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fair</span> amount to compensate
users for their data at a given privacy level based on an axiomatic definition of fairness, along the lines of the
celebrated Shapley value.
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first fairness concepts
for data that explicitly consider privacy constraints.
We also formulate a heterogeneous federated learning problem for the platform with
privacy level options for users. By studying this problem, we investigate
the amount of compensation users receive under fair allocations with different
privacy levels, amounts of data, and degrees of heterogeneity.
We also discuss what happens when the platform is forced to design fair incentives. Under certain conditions
we find that when privacy sensitivity is low, the platform will set incentives to ensure that it collects all the data with the lowest privacy options. When the privacy sensitivity is above a given threshold, the platform will provide no incentives to users. Between these two extremes, the platform will set the incentives so some fraction of the users chooses the higher privacy option and the others chooses the lower privacy option.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From media to healthcare to transportation, the vast amount of data generated by people every day has solved difficult problems across many domains. Nearly all machine learning algorithms, including those based on deep learning rely heavily on data and many of the largest companies to ever exist center their business around this precious resource of data. This includes directly selling access to data to others for profit, selling targeted advertisements based on data, or by exploiting data through data-driven engineering, to better develop and market products.
Simultaneously, as users become more privacy conscious, online platforms are increasingly providing <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">privacy level</em> options for users. Platforms may provide incentives to users to influence their privacy decisions. This manuscript investigates how platforms can fairly compensate users for their data contribution at a given privacy level.
Consider a platform offering geo-location services with three privacy level options:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A non-private option, where all user data is stored and owned by the platform.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">If users choose option (i), the platform does not stand to gain from using that data in other tasks. If the user chooses (ii), the platform is better off, but still has limited access to the data via FL and may not be able to fully leverage its potential.
Therefore, the platform wants to incentivize users to choose option (iii).
This may be done by providing services, discounts or money to users that choose this option. Effectively, by choosing an option, users are informally selling (or not selling) their data to platforms.
Due to the lack of a formal exchange, it can be difficult to understand if this sale of user data is <em id="S1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fair</em>. Are platforms making the cost of choosing private options like (i) or (ii) too high? Is the value of data much higher than the platform is paying?</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A major shortcoming of the current understanding of data value is that it often fails to explicitly consider a critical factor in an individual’s decision to share data—privacy.
This work puts forth two rigorous notions of the fair value of data in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Axiomatic Fairness with Privacy ‣ The Fair Value of Data Under Heterogeneous Privacy Constraints in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that explicitly include privacy and make use of the axiomatic framework of the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Shapley value</em> from game theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shapley, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">1952</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Compelled by the importance of data in our modern economy
and a growing social concern about privacy, this paper presents frameworks for quantifying the fair value of private data.
Specifically, we consider a setting where users are willing to provide their data to a platform in exchange for some sort of payment and under some privacy guarantees depending on their level of privacy requirements. The platform is responsible for running the private learning algorithm on the gathered data and making the fair payments with the objective of maximizing its utility including statistical accuracy and total amount of payments.

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fallah et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> the authors consider an optimal data acquisition problem in the context of private mean estimation in two different local and central heterogeneous DP settings.
It is assumed that players care about both the estimation error of the common estimator generated by the platform and any payments made to them by the platform in their decision making.
By assuming linear privacy sensitivity represented by scalars and drawn from a distribution, they devise a mechanism for computing the near-Bayes optimal privacy levels to provide to the players.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cummings et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite> focuses on the central setting, under both the linear privacy sensitivity and the privacy constraints model, offering insights into the optimal solution.

Finally, we note that we consider the concept of fairness in data valuation, not algorithmic fairness, which relates to the systematic failure of machine learning systems to account for data imbalances.</p>

Privacy sensitivity is the cost that a user experiences by choosing a particular privacy level. Their formulation allows for a relatively straightforward application of notions like incentive compatibility and individual rationality from mechanism design theory. In this work, we instead emphasize that users choose a privacy level, rather than report a somewhat nebulously defined privacy sensitivity.
Despite this difference, the notions of fairness described in the following section can be applied more broadly.</p>

Recall that the NE is a stable state such that no user gains by unilaterally changing their strategy. Depending on the circumstances, we may also want to consider equilibrium points in mixed strategies (distributions) over the privacy space. This could make sense if we expect users to continually interact with the platform, making a different choice each time, such that users ultimately converge to their long-run average payoff. In such cases, we can formulate the problem for the platform as:

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">What is a fair way to distribute incentives? One approach is to view the users and platforms as a coalition jointly generating utility. Following an axiomatic approach to fairness, the celebrated Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shapley, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">1952</a>)</cite> describes how to fairly divide utility among a coalition. In this section, we take a similar approach to defining fairness.
This coalitional perspective is not a complete characterization of the complex dynamics between users and platforms, but we argue that it is still a useful one.
One of the benefits of this concept of fairness is that it deals with intrinsic value (i.e., how much of the utility comes from the data). This is in contrast to the <em id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">market value</em> that users are willing to sell for (potentially depressed). This information is particularly useful to economists, regulators, and investors, who are interested in characterizing the value of data as capital for the purposes of analysis, taxation, and investment respectively.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">FL is a distributed learning process used when data is either too large or too sensitive to be directly transferred in full to the platform.
Instead of combining all the data together and learning at the platform, each user performs some part of the learning locally and the results are aggregated at the platform, providing some level of privacy.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Donahue &amp; Kleinberg (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> consider a setting where heterogeneous users voluntarily opt-in to federation. A natural question to ask is: how much less valuable to the platform is a user that chooses to federate with others as compared to one that provides full access to their data?
Furthermore, how should the platform allocate incentives to get users to federate? This section addresses these questions.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We conclude this section by remarking that this is just one particular formulation of a federated learning problem where users have privacy choice. Another interesting formulation can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Aldaghri et al. (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, which comes from the literature on personalized federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In this formulation, all users join the federated learning process, but some users can choose between a private option, where their data is protected via differential privacy, or a standard non-private option. Exploring fair incentives in this, and other models could be an interesting direction for future work.</p>

<p id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.5" class="ltx_p">Two key novelties of our work is that we (1) consider a constraint of fairness and (2) have users choose a privacy level, rather than report their privacy sensitivity. This is different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fallah et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Cummings et al. (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>, which rely on incentive compatibility, and have users report their privacy parameters. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fallah et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, a computationally efficient algorithm is proposed for computing user payments and privacy levels to assign users. Both of these works consider a mean estimation problem, where users have i.i.d. samples, and so also have the “equal marginal contribution” assumption that we have. Distinct from our model, users have an additional term in their utility where they benefit from reduced error in the estimation problem. These works focus on maximizing the platform utility, and it is very clear that the payments deviate significantly from the fair ones that satisfy the fairness axioms.

For example, in the case where payment is below the threshold of both users, neither participate at the low-privacy level, when the payment is high enough both participate at the low privacy level, and for the remaining intermediate cases, either only one user chooses the low privacy option, or there is some asymmetric mixed strategy.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the unique defining characteristics of data is that its generation process is inherently distributed, so no single entity exists to advocate for data sellers. In the past, platforms have been able to extract data from users, often with little to no compensation in return. As public consciousness around privacy changes, a nuanced relationship around privacy between platforms and users must develop.
Transparency and understanding the value of user data is an important step in empowering regulators, consumers, and platforms.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces two formal definitions of fair payments in the context of acquisition of private data. The first treats the users and the platform together and uses axioms like those of the Shapley value to determine a unique fair distribution of utility. In the second, we define a notion of fairness between the users only, leading to a definition of fairness that admits a range of values, of which the platform is free to choose the most favorable.
By formulating a federated mean estimation problem, we show that heterogeneous users can have significantly different contributions to the overall utility, and that a fair incentive, according to our second notion, must take into account the amount of data, privacy level as well as the degree of heterogeneity. We formulate and solve the fairness-constrained mechanism design problem in this federated mean estimation problem, and also find that data heterogeneity and user properties play an important role in the solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While previous literature has investigated how platforms should design incentives for users in order to optimize its utility, the definitions of fairness we propose offers another important way to evaluate the fairness of these mechanisms. This is a critical step towards future research in ensuring that data acquisition mechanisms are <em id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">both</em> fair for users and efficient for platforms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Though we provide a characterization of optimal fair mechanisms when privacy sensitivity is the same across users, designing mechanisms and developing theories that scale up these solutions to deal with platform that interact with large and diverse groups of users is critical.
Additionally, users may come and go, as their sensitivities may change over time. Understanding how fluctuating users alter the model is of great practical significance.
Furthermore, there is subjectivity in the choice of axioms, and other choices may lead to meaningful notions of fairness worthy of study.
We have also assumed a non-divisible and transferable utility, but in many cases, users are paid for their data in the form of access to services. Investigating the impact of this will also be important for the practical application of a comprehensive theory for fairness.</p>

<p id="A3.p1.4" class="ltx_p">When beginning this work, the dearth of algorithms that supported heterogeneous privacy constraints surprised us, given the increasing number of privacy options available to users. All of the algorithms that did exist were provably sub-optimal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hu &amp; Gong (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, or placed constraints on privacy parameters to prove approximate optimality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Fallah et al. (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>. In both of these works, the pathology of the algorithm leads to error that is not monotonically decreasing in <math id="A3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{\rho}" display="inline"><semantics id="A3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="A3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="A3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝝆</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="A3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝝆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A3.p1.1.m1.1c">\bm{\rho}</annotation></semantics></math>. For DP-based notions of privacy, which both of the aforementioned works are, one can prove that an optimal error must be monotonic.
