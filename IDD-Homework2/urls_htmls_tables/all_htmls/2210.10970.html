<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">To enable communication-efficient federated learning (FL), this paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled FL system, where the UAV coordinates distributed ground devices for a shared model training.
Specifically, by exploiting the UAV’s high altitude and mobility, the UAV can proactively establish short-distance line-of-sight links with devices and prevent any device from being a communication straggler.
Thus, the model aggregation process can be accelerated while the cumulative model loss caused by device scheduling can be reduced, resulting in a decreased completion time.
We first present the convergence analysis of FL without the assumption of convexity, demonstrating the effect of device scheduling on the global gradients.
Based on the derived convergence bound, we further formulate the completion time minimization problem by jointly optimizing device scheduling, UAV trajectory, and time allocation.
This problem explicitly incorporates the devices’ energy budgets, dynamic channel conditions, and convergence accuracy of FL constraints.
Despite the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we exploit its structure to decompose it into two sub-problems and further derive the optimal solutions via the Lagrange dual ascent method.
Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the tradeoff between completion time and prediction accuracy in practical FL settings compared to existing benchmarks.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As the storage and computation capabilities of edge devices keep growing, it becomes more attractive to process the data locally and push network computation to the edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In the field of machine learning (ML), distributed learning frameworks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> that keep the training data locally are well developed to protect data privacy and reduce network energy/time costs.
Recently, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has been proposed as a promising solution for distributed ML, which enables multiple devices to execute local training on their own dataset and collaboratively build a shared ML model with the coordination of a parameter server (PS) (e.g., access point and base station).
Since only model parameters rather than raw data are exchanged between devices and the PS, FL significantly relieves the communication burden and protects data privacy<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> with wide-field applications, e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and content recommendations for smartphones<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to the centralized ML, the PS in FL needs to exchange models with multiple devices over hundreds to thousands of communication rounds to achieve the desired training accuracy.
However, the main challenge in realizing FL on wireless networks arises from communication stragglers with unfavorable links <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
For example, in over-the-air computation (AirComp)-based analog FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, communication stragglers dominate the overall model aggregation error caused by channel fading and communication noise since the devices with better channel qualities have to reduce their transmit power for the local models’ alignment at the PS.
Moreover, in digital synchronous FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, communication stragglers significantly slow down the model aggregation process and dominate cumulative communication delay since the PS must wait until receiving the training updates from all participants.
If the number of communication stragglers is high, the overall communication delay will be unacceptable.
The straggler issue is thus the main bottleneck to design communication-efficient FL systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There have been many efforts to mitigate the communication straggler effect in FL, such as device scheduling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
For instance, to reduce model misalignment error incurred by stragglers in AirComp-based FL, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> scheduled the devices with reliable channels for concurrent model uploading.
In addition, to reduce the communication delay incurred by stragglers in digital FL, devices with large contributions to the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> or/and with favorable channel conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> are generally selected.
Nevertheless, because such device scheduling is biased, which results in a smaller amount of training data utilized, this, in turn, may damage the update of the global model and decrease the learning performance of FL.
To alleviate such communication-learning tradeoff, recent research has investigated the integration of advanced technologies (i.e., relays <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>) into FL systems to improve stragglers’ communication qualities and thus further upgrade device scheduling policy for the reduction of communication errors.
These existing frameworks require a terrestrial BS to provide network coverage to the devices for model aggregation.
However, many FL tasks need to be performed under the circumstances when terrestrial networks are unavailable in remote areas.
For example, devices from multiple regions (e.g., forests and woodlands) can collaborate through FL to build a learning model for fire monitoring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
Under these harsh environments, it is imperative to deploy a more flexible PS that proactively establishes favorable communication links among devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As a viable complementary alternative to terrestrial networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide coverage extension and seamless connectivity to support various FL tasks, especially in distant and underdeveloped areas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
Inspired by this, this paper studies a UAV-enabled FL network, where a UAV is dispatched as a flying PS to aggregate and update the digital FL model parameters when no terrestrial BS is available.
To mitigate the communication straggler effect in UAV-enabled FL networks, we propose to jointly design UAV trajectory and device scheduling.
First, the qualities of communication channels between the UAV and devices still differ since all links’ channel conditions depend on the UAV’s location at each time slot.
To address this issue, device scheduling is necessary to prevent communication stragglers.
Furthermore, by utilizing its mobility, the UAV can establish short-distance LoS links to scheduled devices.
As a result, each scheduled device achieves a high data rate for model uploading, resulting in faster model uploads/downloads per round compared to the static UAV.
In addition, with its ability to dynamically adjust communication distances, the UAV can prevent any device from being a communication straggler all the time, ensuring that all devices have the opportunity to participate in FL training.
As such, incorporated with UAV trajectory planning, the optimized device scheduling strategy focuses on data exploitation maximization, thereby reducing cumulative model aggregation loss and accelerating FL convergence.
Hence, such join design in UAV-enabled FL networks is an appealing solution to address the straggler issue and reduce communication time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we focus on the time required for completing the FL training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which includes not only the computation time but also the communication time of all scheduled devices.
The completion time is a critical design aspect in UAV-enabled systems, as UAVs usually have a limited endurance due to the practical physical constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Additionally, devices generally have a limited energy budget without battery replacement or recharging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Thus, the formulated optimization problem needs to consider not only the FL constraints such as the target convergence accuracy level but also the devices’ dynamic communication conditions such as energy consumption.
As such, this paper aims to minimize the completion time of UAV-enabled FL by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, device scheduling, and time allocation for energy-constrained devices, while ensuring that the FL algorithm can converge to a target accuracy.</p>

To solve problem (<a href="#S2.Ex1" title="II-A FL Training Model ‣ II System Model ‣ Federated Learning via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-A</span></span></a>), the training procedure of FL consists of multiple communication rounds.
Therein, in a communication round, the devices update the local models based on their own data and a common model initialization from the PS.
After that, they contribute to the global model at the PS by uploading model updates over the wireless channel, as described below.</p>

With (<a href="#S2.E4" title="In II-A FL Training Model ‣ II System Model ‣ Federated Learning via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) and (<a href="#S2.E5" title="In II-A FL Training Model ‣ II System Model ‣ Federated Learning via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>), the UAV and the devices can repeatedly update their models until the maximum number of communication rounds reaches.
As the local FL models are updated at the scheduled devices and transmitted over wireless cellular links, device scheduling determines both the learning performance and communication delay.
Furthermore, the channel conditions between the UAV and devices vary over different time slots due to the mobility of the UAV.
Hence, device scheduling should be optimized along with the time allocation and UAV trajectory to account for time-varying channel conditions and the target convergence accuracy required of FL.
In the next subsection, we elaborate on the communication and computation models of FL over UAV-enabled networks.</p>

This is because the initial location corresponds to the practical mobility constraint on the UAV such as the UAV’s launching location or its pre-mission flying paths, etc.
We assume that the link between each device and the UAV is dominated by the LoS channel because UAVs usually fly at high altitudes for safety reasons, as most existing studies on UAVs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

<p id="Thmremark1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we can see, the expression (<a href="#S3.E18" title="In Theorem 1. ‣ III-A Convergence Analysis of FL ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>) comprises two terms. The first term is the initial optimality gap. For the first term, when the number of communication rounds, the learning step-size, and the initial model parameter are given, the initial optimality gap is a constant.
The second term is the time-average aggregation error resulting from the effect of device scheduling.
For the second term, the time-average aggregation error decreases as the number of scheduled devices increases, particularly when large data-size devices are scheduled.
However, scheduling more devices in one round for model uploading increases the communication burden and may significantly slow down the model aggregation process, especially if there are communication stragglers.
Thus, it is crucial to schedule a proper subset of devices to balance training performance and time consumption.</p>

This is because imposing more stringent convergence accuracy requirements increases the required amount of scheduled devices in the FL training process, which can be observed from constraint (<a href="#S3.E20.6" title="In 20 ‣ III-B Problem Formulation ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">20f</span></a>).

Fortunately, by exploiting the UAV’s mobility, UAV can dynamically establish favorable connections with scheduled devices in each round to mitigate the communication straggler issue, thereby reducing the completion time of the FL.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we present the BCD-LD method to design the device scheduling, time allocation, and UAV trajectory.
Specifically, we first optimize the device scheduling and time allocation for a given UAV trajectory.
Given device scheduling and time allocation solutions, we then optimize the UAV trajectory <math id="S4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bm{Q}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝑸</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑸</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p1.1.m1.1c">\bm{Q}</annotation></semantics></math>.
To avoid the high computational complexity, we also use LD methods to derive the optimal and closed-form solutions for each optimization subproblem.</p>

First, the UAV visits the devices in both clusters as close as possible along an arc path, which means the UAV proactively shortens the devices’ communication distance and thus schedules different devices to participate in FL training.
We also observe that the densities of sampling points on the trajectory in different time slots are different.
As a result of varying channel coefficients, the selected devices change during training.</p>

In addition, the Static UAV scheme has a shorter completion time than the Static UAV w/ HS scheme since the former avoids the aggregation error explosion by excluding the weak devices.
However, in the case of strong straggler issues, the performance gain brought by device scheduling optimization alone is very limited.
Fortunately, the proposed joint design scheme incorporated trajectory design with device scheduling significantly reduce the completion time compared to all benchmarks.
This is because, the mobile UAV can shorten communication distances between the scheduled devices and always achieve a high transmission rate for local model uploading, thereby accelerating the model aggregation process. These results demonstrate in UAV-enabled systems, joint trajectory and device scheduling device is critical to mitigating the communication stragglers’ effect.</p>

This is because the proposed joint design scheme overcomes the straggler issue and maximizes data exploitation.
Specifically, the UAV’s trajectory tends to be close to the devices to establish strong communication links, thus maximizing data exploitation.
In contrast, at some UAV locations (e.g., the initial position), where the communication straggler issue is severe, the device schedule is optimized to let no device be involved in FL training.
This is the reason why the curve of the proposed joint design scheme is invariant during the initial communication rounds.
On the other hand, by properly designing the trajectory of the UAV, short-distance LoS links can be proactively and dynamically established for any device, which ensures all devices have equal opportunity to participate in FL training instead of device exclusion, thereby increasing the data exploitation and training accuracy.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied the UAV-assisted FL system to effectively address the straggler issue by exploiting the UAV’s high altitude and mobility when the terrestrial PS was unavailable.
Specifically, a mobile UAV was deployed as a flying PS to exchange model parameters from distributed ground devices and train a shared FL model.
We focused on the joint consideration of device scheduling, UAV trajectory, and time allocation to minimize the completion time required for FL to converge to the desired accuracy level.
Before proceeding with problem formulation, we first theoretically analyzed the effect of device scheduling on the convergence rate of FL without the assumptions of convexity.
We also provided a convergence bound for the average norm of the global gradient.
Based on such convergence results, we formulated the completion time minimization problem, taking into account the practical device’s energy budget, UAV’s mobility constraints, and convergence accuracy constraint.
Although the formulated problem was non-convex, we exploited its structures to decompose it into two sub-problems, followed by deriving closed-form solutions via the Lagrange dual ascent method.
Simulation results demonstrated that our proposed joint design can significantly reduce completion time and enhance the tradeoff between completion time and prediction accuracy compared to the existing benchmarks.</p>
