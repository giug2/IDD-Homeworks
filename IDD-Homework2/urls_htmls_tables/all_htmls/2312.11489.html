<p id="id26.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) enables training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models over end devices without compromising their privacy. As computing tasks are increasingly performed by a combination of cloud, edge, and end devices, FL can benefit from this End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration (EECC) paradigm to achieve collaborative device-scale expansion with real-time access. Although Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) supports multi-tier model aggregation suitable for EECC, prior works assume the same model structure on all computing nodes, constraining the model scale by the weakest end devices. To address this issue, we propose Agglomerative Federated Learning (FedAgg), which is a novel EECC-empowered FL framework that allows the trained models from end, edge, to cloud to grow larger in size and stronger in generalization ability. FedAgg recursively organizes computing nodes among all tiers based on Bridge Sample Based Online Distillation Protocol (BSBODP), which enables every pair of parent-child computing nodes to mutually transfer and distill knowledge extracted from generated bridge samples. This design enhances the performance by exploiting the potential of larger models, with privacy constraints of FL and flexibility requirements of EECC both satisfied.
Experiments under various settings demonstrate that FedAgg outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 4.53% accuracy gains and remarkable improvements in convergence rate.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> has emerged as a promising technique for various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> since it enables collaborative training of AI models over end devices without exchanging their raw data, ensuring both high model performance and data privacy.
As the mainstream computing paradigm shifts from centralized cloud computing to decentralized End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration (EECC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, large-scale computing tasks are increasingly performed by a combination of centralized cloud servers, bridge edge servers, and a large number of end devices instead of relying solely on the cloud.
FL can benefit from this more distributed computing paradigm to fully exploit pervasive devices and rapidly access large amounts of data for delivering real-time services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
However, prevailing FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> adopt a simple client-server architecture with two tiers (also called levels), where the server is either on the cloud or the edge. The server collaborates with end devices (also called clients) by iteratively aggregating model parameters uploaded from devices and dispatching the updated global model to all devices. These FL methods are not suitable for EECC paradigm, which requires multi-level collaboration among computing nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> is proposed to support multi-tier model aggregation in FL, from underlying devices to the bridged edge servers and the cloud servers.
This manner brings the advantages of device-scale expansion with multi-level collaboration.
When implementing HFL with EECC, computing power heterogeneity across end, edge, and cloud nodes should be taken into consideration to fully unleash the potential of EECC.
Specifically, cloud servers are equipped with powerful computing capabilities and storage resources, which outperform edge servers, and end devices possess relatively constrained resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
However, existing HFL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> require imposing the same model structure on all computing nodes for model aggregation, inevitably limiting the scale of trained models by the weakest end devices due to the bottleneck effect and encountering resource under-utilization over edge and cloud computing nodes.
To take full advantage of the computation superiority of edge and cloud nodes over end devices, it is critical to deploy appropriate models on end, edge, and cloud nodes that are compatible with their computation capability and also achieve model-agnostic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> collaborative training in EECC-empowered FL methods.
In this way, larger models can be trained on the edge and cloud nodes with stronger characterization and generalization ability to achieve performance improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we propose a novel FL framework suitable for EECC paradigm, named Agglomerative Federated Learning (FedAgg).
To be specific, FedAgg recursively organizes computing nodes to collaboratively train models that grow in size from end devices, edge servers to cloud servers via our customized Bridge Sample Based Online Distillation Protocol (BSBODP), which defines the interaction rules among every pair of parent-child computing nodes in an end-edge-cloud network with a tree-topology. During training, the knowledge acquired by the upper-level nodes (closer to the cloud) from the lower-level nodes (closer to devices) is recursively transferred to the cloud, tier by tier via BSBODP.
In this way, upper-level nodes can deploy larger models with higher capability and integrate the knowledge of lower-level nodes in an agglomerative manner.
Regarding BSBODP, model-agnostic collaborative training is achieved in any pair of parent-child computing nodes, where a pre-trained lightweight decoder is used to generate fake samples (called bridge samples) whose extracted logits are used for knowledge distillation among nodes.
To our best knowledge,

The proposed framework is able to train models that are adapted to the power of computing nodes and satisfy the privacy constraints of FL as well as the flexibility requirements of EECC.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) is first proposed by Liu <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, where the established end-edge-cloud FL architecture combines the advantages of both massive data coverage of cloud computing and low communication latency of edge computing.
Following Liu <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a series of works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> are proposed to accelerate the training process or improve the system performance of HFL by building clients’ cluster topology and performing hierarchical aggregation on top of local training, taking into account the computing and communication capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> as well as data distribution and mobility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> of end devices.
In particular, Nguyen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposes a novel hierarchical distributed learning framework inspired by democratized learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which extends conventional HFL through a self-organizing hierarchical structure based on agglomerative clustering, and enhances both local personalization and global generalization in distributed training.
However, all the above methods require participating computing nodes to adopt the same model structure, which limits the model scale to the capability of end devices and wastes the resources of edge and cloud nodes with substantial computing power.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With sufficient training data, increasing model size is a common way of improving model accuracy and generalization ability in deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
However, prevailing FL approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> require homogeneous models to be adopted in both the powerful central server and the resource-limited end devices, which prevents the training of larger models beyond the maximum capability of end devices. To address this challenge, prior works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> propose two types of solutions to train larger models that surpass the resource limits of devices, one based on partial training and the other based on knowledge distillation.
In particular, partial training-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> divide the complete global model into multiple sub-models and then train these sub-models on multiple clients in parallel, thereby allowing the model on server obtained by collaborative training to exceed the size of the largest model on clients.
Knowledge distillation-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> leverage the model output of clients as a regularization term for the server-side model training, thereby achieving the transfer of integrated representation learned by clients on decentralized private data.
However, the above methods are designed for two-tier architectures and cannot support collaborative model training empowered by end-edge-cloud networks.
Therefore, the applicability of the aforementioned works is highly restricted.</p>

For flexibility reasons, EECC should take into account the dynamic migration of computing nodes caused by manifold factors such as uneven load distribution, unreliable network connections, node failures, etc. Specifically, each node should be able to flexibly switch to different parent nodes at the same level, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ III-B Hierarchical Federated Learning Empowered by End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration ‣ III Preliminary ‣ Agglomerative Federated Learning: Empowering Larger Model Training via End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

Prevailing FL interaction protocols are based on parameters interaction like FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, where upper-level nodes aggregate and distribute model parameters from and to lower-level nodes.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the intrinsic property of EECC, lower-level end devices possess abundant data but limited computing resources, while the upper-level nodes have powerful computation ability but no data.
In order to access local data directly and meet the privacy requirements of FL, existing EECC-empowered FL methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> conduct model training on end devices and only perform model aggregation on the edge and cloud.
However, this manner requires the same model structure to be adopted among all computing nodes, thereby limiting the scale of trained models by the weakest end devices and encountering computation capability waste of edge and cloud nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To exploit the powerful computation of edge and cloud nodes, we prompt the intuitive motivation of training larger models on edge and cloud nodes than end devices for achieving higher accuracy with stronger generalization abilities.
A feasible way to realize this idea is to conduct
online distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> as an interaction protocol among computing nodes at different tiers, which enables different nodes to train models with heterogeneous structures via iteratively exchanging the logits (also called knowledge) between two nodes to guide reciprocal model training.
However, directly integrating online distillation into EECC-powered FL may raise privacy concerns about sharing data on devices, as the same sample is required to extract logits across different computing nodes.
To overcome this, we design a new interaction protocol named Bridge Sample Based Online Distillation Protocol (BSBODP), which employs fake data as a bridge to transfer knowledge across multi-level nodes with the assistance of a lightweight pre-trained autoencoder.
This fake data is generated by the decoder from either encoded or received embeddings, allowing for computing logits without revealing raw data on devices.

</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given a multi-tier architecture in EECC, each node can adopt a model structure that matches its own computing power, and the lower-level nodes can iteratively transfer their learned representations to the upper-level nodes via BSBODP.
Therefore, the model on the cloud can eventually integrate the knowledge of all nodes and achieve satisfactory performance with sufficient capacity.
Based on this concept, we propose Agglomerative Federated Learning (FedAgg), which enables the training of larger models with better performance on powerful cloud and edge nodes than on resource-limited end devices via agglomerating knowledge generated by ever-expanding models from bottom to top in the multi-tier architecture in EECC.
By leveraging the advantages of knowledge agglomeration, FedAgg enables the trained models from the bottom to the top to grow in size and generalization ability without violating the privacy principle in FL. Moreover, FedAgg can also handle scenarios where any computing nodes dynamically change their parents within the same tier, which ensures deployment flexibility in a realistic EEC-NET.</p>

In particular, each leaf computing node additionally preserves a pre-trained encoder (forms a pre-trained autoencoder with the aforementioned decoder) for encoding local data into embeddings, which will be transmitted to its parent node until reaching the root node.
During the execution phase, each computing node utilizes the decoder to generate bridge samples that match the data distribution of its corresponding leaf nodes based on the embeddings encoded from private data or uploaded by sub-nodes.
These bridge samples are used as intermediaries to conduct online distillation between every pair of parent-child computing nodes aligned by the same embedding.
As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-C Interaction Protocols in Federated Learning ‣ III Preliminary ‣ Agglomerative Federated Learning: Empowering Larger Model Training via End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, it is difficult to recover raw information from the embeddings of private samples since the embeddings are generated based on an extremely lightweight autoencoder (<math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><lt id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"></lt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">&lt;</annotation></semantics></math>50K model parameters) that are pre-trained on a super large open dataset (such as ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>). As the autoencoder is not able to capture the fine-grained features and reconstruct training samples from them, bridge sample generation and distillation will not reveal data privacy.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Considering FL in an EEC-NET where computing nodes are organized in a tree topology, we propose the FedAgg framework, which applies BSBODP to achieve collaborative training over every pair of parent-child computing nodes, recursively distilling knowledge from bottom to top in an agglomerative manner, as formulated in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="In IV-B Bridge Sample Based Online Distillation Protocol ‣ IV Agglomerative Federated Learning ‣ Agglomerative Federated Learning: Empowering Larger Model Training via End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Specifically, FedAgg includes two main phases: initialization and recursive training with BSBODP.
In the initialization phase, leaf nodes generate embeddings using their pre-trained encoders and send them up the tree hierarchy to the root node.
In the training phase, each node recursively distills the knowledge from the sub-tree that seeks it as the root, and passes the newly extracted knowledge to its parent, applying BSBODP to enable interaction between parent-child pairs.
This process starts from the leaf nodes and ends with the cloud server, where the model on the cloud is updated with the learned knowledge from all tiers. Due to the nature of EEC-NET’s computing resources and the model-agnostic property of BSBODP, the upper-level nodes can deploy larger models and integrate more knowledge from lower-level nodes to achieve superior performance, and the largest model (i.e. the model on the cloud) is exactly the model that we want to gain through collaborative training.

To demonstrate the advantage of FedAgg in handling dynamic migration of computing nodes, we classify existing FL interaction protocols that potentially support hierarchical collaborative model training into two types based on their constraints on model structures of the interacting computing nodes: equivalence interaction protocols and partial order interaction protocols.
In the following part, we will give formal definitions of these two types of interaction protocols, and prove that equivalence interaction protocols, including our proposed BSBODP adopted by FedAgg, provide better support for dynamic migration of computing nodes.</p>

Regarding model structures, we deploy the same lightweight 6-layer autoencoder pre-trained on ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> on all the end devices and the decoder part of the autoencoder on other computing nodes. In addition, 3-layer-Convolutional Neural Networks (3-layer-CNN), ResNet-10 and ResNet-18 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> with small to large model sizes are deployed on the end, edge, and cloud nodes respectively, fitting the capability of computing nodes across different tiers. The configurations of model structures can be found in TABLE <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V-A2 Baselines and Criteria ‣ V-A Experiment Setup ‣ V Experiments ‣ Agglomerative Federated Learning: Empowering Larger Model Training via End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.</p>

In our experiments, we assume that the servers in FedGKT and FedDKC are deployed on the cloud and directly communicate with end devices.
In addition, system performance is evaluated by the test accuracy of the cloud-side model after convergence or within 500 communication rounds.</p>

The results demonstrate that the variation of the model structures on clients has a negligible effect on the performance of the cloud-side model.
This implies that FedAgg can tolerate the heterogeneity of device-side models and is suitable for the EECC scenario where devices have different computing capabilities.</p>

We observe that the performance of FedAgg drops significantly as the model size on the cloud decreases.
This further confirms that our proposed FedAgg can achieve remarkable performance gains by enabling the deployment of larger models on the cloud than on end devices.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the limitation of model scale on powerful edge and cloud computing nodes constrained by the weakest end devices in EECC-empowered FL, we propose a novel federated learning framework called Agglomerative Federated Learning (FedAgg), which allows the trained models from end devices, bridge edge servers, to cloud servers to grow larger in size and stronger in generalization ability.
To be specific, FedAgg recursively distills knowledge from bottom to top in an agglomeration manner via our customized Bridge Sample Based Online Distillation Protocol (BSBODP), which can achieve model-agnostic interaction across every pair of parent-child computing nodes through online distillation over generated bridge samples. To our best knowledge, FedAgg is the first framework empowered by EECC that enables training larger models with ever-increasing capability tier by tier up to the cloud, and can achieve superior performance than related state-of-the-art methods in terms of test accuracy and convergence rate.</p>
