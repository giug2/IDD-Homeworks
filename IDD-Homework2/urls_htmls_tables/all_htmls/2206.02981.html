The introduced FL-EOCD leverages device-to-device (D2D) communications and overlapped clustering to enable decentralized aggregation, where a cluster is defined as a coverage zone of a typical device. The devices located on the overlapped clusters are called bridge devices (BDs). In the proposed FL-EOCD scheme, a clustering topology is envisioned where clusters are connected through BDs, so as the aggregated models of each cluster is disseminated to the other clusters in a decentralized manner without the need for a global aggregator or an additional hop of transmission.
Unlike the star-based FL, the proposed FL-EOCD scheme involves a large number of local devices by reusing the RRBs in different non-adjacent clusters. To evaluate our proposed FL-EOCD scheme as opposed to baseline FL schemes, we consider minimizing the overall energy-consumption of devices while maintaining the convergence rate of FL subject to its time constraint. To this end, a joint optimization problem, considering scheduling the local devices/BDs to the CHs and computation frequency allocation, is formulated, where an iterative solution to this joint problem is devised. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FL-EOCD algorithm over FL conventional schemes in terms of energy consumption, latency, and convergence rate.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning (ML) techniques have been leveraged to provide various services, such as virtual reality, traffic prediction, and object recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The ML model training is usually implemented at the base station (BS) in a centralized manner, where the raw data is required to be collected at the BS for training coexist. However, in many applications, datasets are generated at edge devices, and consequently, transmitting raw data from all devices to BS incurs huge network traffic and devices data privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the traditional centralized ML techniques are not preferable for next generation wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed machine learning (ML) algorithms for addressing the aforementioned bandwidth and privacy challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The popular FL conventional architectures are: (i) star-based FL architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and (ii) relay-assisted/dual-hop FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, also called hierarchical FL. In each iteration of the star-based FL, each device trains a local model based on its own dataset and then transmits its local trained model to the BS. The BS then aggregates all the received models into one global model and broadcasts it back to the devices. These procedures are repeated several rounds until the global model converge. Similar to the star-based FL, the hierarchical FL requires the BS to aggregate all the local models of the devices, which are collected by cluster-heads (CHs) (or relays). In particular, two-hop transmission is required in the hierarchical FL, i.e., the CHs/relays need to forward the local models of devices to the BS. Despite the fact that hierarchical FL can improve the limited connectivity of devices and reduce their energy consumption, its main limitation, as previously mentioned, is that it requires two-hop transmission. However, these FL conventional architectures pose prime concerns for the wireless edge since the devices may exhibit: (i) significant heterogeneity
in their computational resources (e.g., limited battery and CPU computations) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>; (ii) varying proximity to the BS (e.g., varying distances from devices to the BS in a cell). As a consequence, a significant amount of energy is consumed to bounce the model between the BS and the devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This consumes the power of the battery-powered devices and the available resources at the BS that may be used for another set of devices.</p>

Unlike the hierarchical FL that can also use D2D clustering, we propose to overlap the clusters such that there is no need to have an additional level of aggregation at the BS, which may consume more energy. Therefore, it is imperative to exploit D2D communications and introduce a novel decentralized FL scheme for tackling the aforementioned issues of the FL conventional schemes.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, a hybrid FL scheme that integrates the star-based topology with D2D communications, called semi-decentralized FL, was designed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. The authors exploited D2D communications to propose a consensus mechanism to mitigate model divergence via low-power communications among nearby devices. However, the main limitation of the semi-decentralized FL in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> is that it uses a global aggregator and two-time scale FL (i.e., D2D communications and device-to-BS wireless transmissions). Different from the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, we design a novel decentralized FL scheme that clusters devices in a way that the models of each cluster is implicitly shared to the other clusters without the need for additional stage of aggregation at the BS. To this end, we propose a novel decentralized FL and resource allocation D2D paradigm to minimize the overall energy consumption of a delay-constrained FL in a partially connected D2D system. In the envisioned system, each single-antenna device has a limited coverage zone, named cluster, and dynamically works as: (i) a local device; (ii) a bridge device (BD); or (iii) a CH that can aggregate the models of the associated local devices and BD in its cluster.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the devices are battery-driven, for a sustainable operation of an FL framework in latency-sensitive applications, it is crucial to reduce the energy consumption of the edge devices and the FL time that consists of computation and communication latency. Therefore, we will focus on works addressing resource
efficiency and latency-constrained FL,
which is the main focus of this paper. Specifically, star-based and hierarchical latency-constrained FL schemes will be reviewed in this section and evaluated in the numerical results section. For a comprehensive survey of the FL literature, we refer the reader to e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several works extensively considered star-based FL from different aspects, such as frequency computation, wireless communications, and radio resource management, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Another set of
works investigated the impact of wireless link conditions, number of collaborating edge devices, and computation frequency allocation on the performance of star-based FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. However, these works mainly relied on the BS for global aggregations. To
reduce the demand for global aggregations, a set of works considered a hierarchical system with two-hop transmission, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. For example, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> developed a hierarchical FL model where edge servers perform partial global aggregations. As mentioned before, such a hierarchical FL model leads to increasing the energy consumption and delay.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For developing energy-efficient FL, several works considered minimizing communication and computation energy, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed an energy-efficient radio resource allocation for delay constrained FL, where they minimized the communication energy and ignored the computation energy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, radio resource allocation was developed to minimize both the communication and computation energy in an FL system subject to delay constraints. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposed joint transmit power and computation frequency allocation to reduce the overall energy consumption of an FL in a fog-aided internet of things (IoT) network. Recently, a joint optimization framework considering device scheduling, transmit power allocation, and device’s computation frequency allocation was proposed to simultaneously minimize the total energy consumption and maximize the number of the scheduled devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. However, an energy-efficient framework, while
jointly considering communication and computation energy, for facilitating FL for network edge devices in partially connected D2D networks was not investigated in the existing literature.</p>

Therefore, to fully capitalize the advantage of D2D communications, we must carefully consider a joint optimization of the CHs selection, device and RRB scheduling, and computation frequency allocation of the devices.</p>

requires more energy. However, the computation time of devices is affected by the allocated computing resources, and increasing the computation frequency of the devices can reduce the latency at the cost of the increased energy consumption. Furthermore, the wireless data transmission latency is determined by the wireless transmission rate, which is related to wireless transmission power. To reduce the wireless communication latency, we can increase the transmission power, however this will consume more energy. Accordingly, a joint optimization of the degrees-of-freedom, namely, CHs selection, device scheduling to the CHs/RRBs, and computation frequency allocation, is required
to satisfy a given FL time constraint and reduce energy consumption. </p>

We formulate an optimization problem to minimize both the computation and communication energy consumption of the devices subject to constraints on FL time, device connectivity, scheduling among the device-CH/RRB, and computation frequency allocation. The proposed joint optimization problem is NP-hard, and thus the global optimal solution
is computationally intractable. To tackle such difficult optimization
problem, an iterative solution framework is devised. Specifically, the overall CH selection, device-CH scheduling, and computation frequency allocation problem is
decomposed into two sub-problems, namely, CHs selection and their devices scheduling sub-problem and computation frequency allocation sub-problem. For each sub-problem, we propose a solution of polynomial computational
complexity, and rigorously justify the effectiveness
of the proposed solutions. By iteratively solving these sub-problems, an FL-EOCD algorithm is developed to minimize the energy consumption.</p>

each device cannot transmit and receive at the same time, i.e., half-duplex D2D channel is adopted, and each device is equipped with a single antenna.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In P0, C1 indicates that each local device is assigned to only one CH and to only one RRB in that CH; C2 indicates that at maximum one BD can be assigned to two adjacent CHs at the same time. In practice and due to the nature of D2D communications, we can have more than one BD at the overlap regions of adjacent CHs. In this case, the BD in the middle of overlapped regions is selected and other BDs are scheduled to the most suitable CHs. C3 is the constraint on local computation resource allocation of devices; and C4 indicates the QoS requirement on the FL time.</p>

MWIS problems. In MWIS problems, two vertices must be non-adjacent in the conflict graph, which is similar to problem (<a href="#S4.E22" title="In IV-B CH, BD, and Local Device Scheduling: P2 Reformulation ‣ IV Proposed Solution ‣ Decentralized Aggregation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning via Overlapped Clustering and D2D Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">22</span></a>), where two local devices cannot be allocated with the same RRB. Likewise, the same RRB cannot be allocated to two different local devices. Furthermore, the objective of (<a href="#S4.E22" title="In IV-B CH, BD, and Local Device Scheduling: P2 Reformulation ‣ IV Proposed Solution ‣ Decentralized Aggregation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning via Overlapped Clustering and D2D Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">22</span></a>) is to minimize the energy consumption, while the
goal of MWIS is to select a set of vertices with minimum weights. Hence, the following corollary characterizes the solution of the optimization problem (<a href="#S4.E22" title="In IV-B CH, BD, and Local Device Scheduling: P2 Reformulation ‣ IV Proposed Solution ‣ Decentralized Aggregation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning via Overlapped Clustering and D2D Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">22</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Essentially, any possible solution to P2.1 using Theorem 1, representing CHs selection and their scheduled local devices, satisfies the following criteria: (i) the represented local devices by vertices in the conflict graph are scheduled to the best CHs/RRBs such that they transmit their local parameters quickly; (ii) the represented CH in each vertex is selected, so as it has a good reachability to many local devices in its coverage as well as it is overlapped with the neighboring CHs. This does not only increase the number of selected local devices that can participate in the training process, but also minimizes the number of clusters; and (iii) a vertex (representing by a subset of local devices) with a smaller weight (representing a sum of their consumed energy) will have a higher priority to be selected in participating in the training process to minimize the objective of P2.1.</p>

locations of the devices. Thereafter, based on the
current computation frequency allocation, the BS designs the FL local graph of each device and judiciously finds the suitable CH clustering and the local device scheduling. Specifically, in order to determine the CHs and schedule the devices, the BS constructs the clustering and the corresponding graph, and then performs the greedy vertex-weighting algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. First, the BS selects the vertex that has the following features: (i) it has a minimum weight in terms of energy consumption and (ii) it is connected to many neighbors that have minimum weights. Next, it constructs the set of vertices that are connected to the selected vertex, and then finds the second minimum-weight vertex. This process is repeated until no neighbors are available in the designed clustering, and this is summarized in lines 21-25 of Algorithm <a href="#algorithm1" title="In IV-C CH Clustering and Local Device/BD Scheduling: Solution to P2.1 ‣ IV Proposed Solution ‣ Decentralized Aggregation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning via Overlapped Clustering and D2D Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Meanwhile, the BS calculates the FL time of the scheduled devices according to (17) to check the feasibility of the scheduled local devices.

Afterword, the associated devices execute the local learning algorithm to update their local optimal models. Meanwhile, the BDs receive the updated models from the CHs and calculate the summation of the received aggregated models. The CHs, consequently, collect all the local models from the associated devices and the models from the BDs to update their cluster models according to (<a href="#S2.E2" title="In II-B Federated Learning Process ‣ II System Model and Federated Learning ‣ Decentralized Aggregation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning via Overlapped Clustering and D2D Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).

Thus, the performance gain of FL-EOCD is not degraded
for a few number of iterations with relatively large number of clusters, thanks to the efficient overlapped clustering and models’ dissemination achieved by FL-EOCD.

Such
an observation can be explained by the following argument. In the proposed FL-EOCD scheme, we judiciously select the CHs such that they have good reachability to many close-by local devices. Thus, the consumed energy for wireless transmissions from devices/BDs to CHs and then from CHs back to devices/BDs is low. However, in the considered star-based FL, devices consume most of the energy for transmitting their trained local models to the distant BS. Consequently, a degradation of the energy consumption is observed at <math id="S6.SS3.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="200" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.p1.3.m3.1a"><mn id="S6.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">200</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.p1.3.m3.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.p1.3.m3.1.1">200</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.p1.3.m3.1c">200</annotation></semantics></math> iterations when the star-based FL converges. It is recalled that in the hierarchical FL,
unlike the proposed FL-EOCD, two-hop transmission is required which consumes more energy. As a result, FL-EOCD achieves an improved

First, it is clear that the FL time depends on the wireless transmission time and the computation learning time of devices. Since all the simulated schemes consider local learning at the devices and optimize the frequency allocation computation, their local learning time is almost the same. Thus, the key factor in the FL time is the communication time of transmitting the trained local models to the CHs/BS plus the transmitting time of sending the aggregated models from CHs/BS back to the devices. Consequently, the FL time is dominated by the wireless transmission time. As can be seen from Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-B Performance of the Proposed FL-EOCD and Benchmark Schemes for Studying the Accuracy and Number of Iterations for Different Overlapped Clustering ‣ VI Numerical Results ‣ Decentralized Aggregation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning via Overlapped Clustering and D2D Communications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, our proposed FL-ECD scheme, that implements simultaneous and short D2D communications, effectively minimizes the FL time with the same accuracy of the considered benchmark schemes.

This argument is due to the fact that hierarchical FL has good and short connectivity among devices which consumes less energy, however it needs two-hop transmission that degrades the FL latency. Our proposed FL-EOCD strikes a balance between these benchmark schemes by (i) augmenting the need for two hops of transmission (unlike hierarchical FL); and (ii) ensuring short-range of communications between CHs and devices/BDs (unlike the star-based FL that requires a distant BS).</p>

In order to study the performance of the developed FL-EOCD scheme, second we have investigated the resource allocation strategy to minimize the energy consumption in a partially connected D2D network subject to FL time constraint. Our proposed resource allocation strategy jointly optimizes the clustering selection, CH-device scheduling, and frequency computation allocation.

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, due to the space limitation, we have numerically proved the convergence rate of our proposed FL-EOCD scheme, and the mathematical analysis of the convergence rate is left for a future work. As an extension, it is also possible to alleviate the existence of a global coordinator (e.g., BS) by developing a game theoretical approach.</p>
