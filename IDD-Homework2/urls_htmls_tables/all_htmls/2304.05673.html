<p id="id2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="id2.1.1" class="ltx_text">We present a deep learning method for accurately localizing the center of a single corneal reflection (CR) in an eye image. Unlike previous approaches, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was trained solely using synthetic data. Using only synthetic data has the benefit of completely sidestepping the time-consuming process of manual annotation that is required for supervised training on real eye images.
To systematically evaluate the accuracy of our method, we first tested it on images with synthetic CRs placed on different backgrounds and embedded in varying levels of noise. Second, we tested the method on two datasets consisting of high-quality videos captured from real eyes.
Our method outperformed state-of-the-art algorithmic methods on real eye images with a <math id="id2.1.1.m1.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1341.5\text{\,}\mathrm{\char 37\relax}\text{/}" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.1.1.m1.3a"><mrow id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.cmml"><mrow id="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4" xref="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">13</mn><mtext id="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1" xref="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">–</mtext><mn id="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2.2" xref="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml">41.5</mn></mrow><mtext id="id2.1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.2" xref="id2.1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.2.cmml"> </mtext><mrow id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.cmml"><mi class="ltx_unit" mathvariant="normal" id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.1.1.1.1.1" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mi><mtext id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.2.2.2.2.2" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.2.2.2.2.2.cmml">/</mtext><mi id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.cmml"></mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.1.1.m1.3b"><apply id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.2">times</csymbol><apply id="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1">range</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1">13</cn><cn type="float" id="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2.2">41.5</cn></apply><apply id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.2.2.2.2.2">divide</csymbol><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.1.1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.cmml" xref="id2.1.1.m1.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3">absent</csymbol></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.1.1.m1.3c">1341.5\text{\,}\mathrm{\char 37\relax}\text{/}</annotation></semantics></math>reduction in terms of spatial precision across data sets, and performed on par with state-of-the-art on synthetic images in terms of spatial accuracy.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An important part of the image processing pipeline in many video-based eye trackers is to localize the center of certain features in the eye image, typically the pupil <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and one or multiple corneal reflections (CRs)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Accurate localization of these features is a prerequisite for an accurate gaze signal produced by the eye tracker. In this paper we focus on localizing the center of a single CR, which together with the pupil (P) center constitute the input for the dominant principle for video-based eye tracking over the past decades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This principle is known as P-CR eye tracking, and is used in high-end commercial systems like the EyeLink from SR Research (Ontario, Canada), where the head is typically constrained relative to the eye camera with a chin and forehead rest.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Conventionally, researchers have relied on using algorithmic methods which require a series of hard coded steps to yield a feature center estimate from the input image. Recent work has however shown that these traditional methods are limited in how accurately a pupil or CR can be localized in an eye image, in particular in the presence of image noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce a deep learning method that—trained on a set of synthetic eye images—is able to accurately locate CR centers in real-world eye images. From a deep learning perspective, using synthetic data tackles the longstanding problem of finding or creating large, annotated databases that deep learning models are traditionally trained on. Our approach not only outperforms the traditional algorithmic methods used by many commercial eye-trackers,
but also introduces a new paradigm for
researchers interested in training deep learning models for gaze estimation. Our approach is not only simple to train, but also offers the flexibility to change the synthetic images used for training to suit the specific needs of the user. Additionally, our approach eliminates the need for large datasets and the time-consuming act of hand labeling images, which are often impractical for smaller research labs due to time and financial constraints.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are several algorithmic methods to detecting CRs in eye images and localizing their center, such as thresholding followed by center of mass calculations or ellipse fitting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Many commercial eye trackers use these approaches, however they tend to suffer from inaccuracies and poor resolution, such as mis-estimating the amplitude of small eye movements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Based on their results, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> hypothesized that these problems could be ascribed to mislocalization of the CR center. Recent theoretical work has indeed shown that accurate localization of the center of the CR with thresholding techniques requires that the CR spans a sufficient number of pixels in the eye images and that the level of image noise remains low <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Besides simple thresholding of the CR in the eye image, other algorithmic methods for CR center localization have been proposed. Recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> showed that radial symmetry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a particle tracking method stemming from the field of microscopy, outperformed simple thresholding in terms of CR localization. However, they only tested the radial symmetry method on eye images where the CR was located fully inside the pupil and thus appeared on a uniform dark background. Depending on the range of gaze directions in the task and the geometry of the setup, the CR will also often be located on the iris or on the border between the pupil and the iris. Since this case was not evaluated by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> who only used a limited range of gaze directions, it remains unclear how the radial symmetry method would perform on real eye images recorded during unconstrained viewing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we aimed to improve the accuracy and precision of high-end P-CR eye tracking in controlled laboratory settings to allow even more robust estimation of small and slow eye movements. We use a two-stage approach, where a traditional method is used for rough localization, followed by a CNN-based method for more accurate localization. Specifically, to simplify the training procedure, and since traditional algorithmic methods such as thresholding are already quite good at CR localization, we first use thresholding followed by centroid calculation to make an initial estimate of CR center location, and then use the CNN on image patches centered around these locations. We compared the performance of our deep learning method to traditional methods such as radial symmetry and thresholding. We predicted that a CNN, when trained effectively, will be able to surpass traditional methods and achieve improved localization performance

In order to train this model effectively we synthesized CRs using 2D Gaussian distributions with different sizes and positions on a background with varying levels of noise (see the “<a href="#S2.SS3" title="In 2 Methods ‣ Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title">Generating Synthetic Images</span></a>” section below for a detailed description).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We use a deep learning framework known as DeepTrack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, originally developed for particle tracking in a microscopy setting. This framework utilizes a CNN trained on synthetic data to track single particles and also includes a U-Net model for tracking multiple particles. Subsequent work using this framework has also incorporated single-shot self-supervised object detection and geometric deep learning models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. The DeepTrack 2.1 Python library <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> makes it easy to generate a synthetic dataset and train a deep learning model in the same pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the DeepTrack 2.1 library has been used outside of digital microscopy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">While many gaze estimation studies deploy deep learning architectures, we focus our literature review specifically on models whose aim is to locate the CR or who create synthetic data used to train the model. We could find only three other deep learning models that have been developed for locating CRs in eye images. First, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> used a three-level CNN network to locate CRs and match their locations in the eye image to the physical locations of the light sources used the generate the CRs. The model included a CNN backbone with feature pyramid outputs as the base architecture. The output was passed into two additional networks, one for identity matching and another for localization. Second, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> trained a U-Net model on 4000 hand-labeled real eye images to accurately detect multiple CRs within the same image. The authors relied on several data augmentation techniques to develop a total of 40,000 samples for training. Third, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposed a lightweight model that both localizes and matches corneal reflections. This model employs an attention mechanism to identify both the pupil center and CRs. They demonstrated improved performance in CR localization and matching when compared to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. It should be noted that by design, the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> was limited to localizing CR centers with pixel resolution, making their approaches unsuitable for our setting where we aim to recover the CR position at higher accuracy. The approach of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> is theoretically able to provide sub-pixel level CR localizations, but in practice achieved an average error of 1.5 pixels, and requires training the model for a specific CR size.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the need for large data sets to enable effective training of machine learning models for gaze estimation, previous studies have successfully used synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a “learning-by-synthesis” approach that trained random regression forests on a dataset of 3D reconstructions of eye regions created using a patch-based multi-view stereo (MVS) algorithm. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> also used a similar approach of generating photo-realistic eye images to be used for a wide range of head poses, gaze directions and illuminations to develop a robust gaze estimation algorithm, and in a separate study generated a dataset of 1 million synthetic eye images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed an unsupervised learning paradigm using generative adversarial networks improving realism of a simulator’s output by using unlabeled real data. They argue synthetic data may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real eye image distributions. The method was tested for gaze and hand pose estimation, showing a significant improvement over using synthetic data alone.
Our study diverges from these previous approaches as we demonstrate that models can be trained to achieve high accuracy using simple, highly controllable synthetic images that are substantially different from real eye images, avoiding the need for sophisticated and time-consuming techniques such as data augmentation or reconstruction methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">This paper addresses the following questions regarding deep learning methods for CR center localization: 1) Can a CNN trained on synthetic images perform CR center localization in real eye images? and if so, 2) Is our method able to locate the CR center more accurately than commonly used algorithmic approaches when applied to synthetic data? and 3) Does our method deliver a CR position signal with higher precision than the algorithmic approaches when applied to real eye images? We focus specifically on high resolution and high quality eye images, since accurate CR localization in high-end eye trackers is key to recording high-precision data where even the smallest and slowest of eye movements, e.g., microsaccades and slow pursuit, can be robustly distinguished from noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">[</span>, c.f.,]</cite>]holmqvist2020small, Nystroem2022, niehorster2020apparent. Nevertheless, to assess the potential generalizability of our method to lower resolution eye images, in a second experiment reported in this paper we also evaluate our approach on spatially downsampled eye images.</p>

This model consisted of three convolutional layers and two dense layers, and we employed the same optimizer and hyperparameter choices as described in the original work. However, when we evaluated this model on our synthetic images that simulated a corneal reflection captured in a video-based eye tracking setup, we were unable to achieve sub-pixel level accuracy. The minimum validation error we reached was 2.95 pixels. To enhance the accuracy of our predictions, we developed our own CNN model. Our model included seven convolutional layers connected to two dense layers. The input to our model is 180 x 180 pixels grayscale images, and it outputs the subpixel location of the corneal reflection center.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We implemented a two-stage training approach for our model to achieve sub-pixel level accuracy. In the first stage, to ensure good generalization, we trained the model on a broader range of CR center locations than the model would typically encounter during inference. We describe the process of generating the images in detail in the following section of the paper. We utilized the Adam optimizer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and a mean squared error (MSE) loss function along with a very small batch size of four. The training was conducted for a maximum of 700 epochs, with an early stopping function implemented to prevent overfitting, achieving a validation error of 0.2338 pixels after 127 epochs. The second stage of training was performed on a dataset containing a smaller range of synthetic CR center locations. During this stage, we fine tuned the model by freezing the first two convolutional blocks while all subsequent layers of the model were set to trainable (i.e unfrozen), and we initialized the model with the weights from the first training stage. For selecting the layers to freeze, we followed an iterative process where we gradually increased the number of trainable layers. We initiated the process with a fully frozen model and subsequently unfroze the layer closest to the model head at each iteration. Additionally, we lowered the learning rate of the Adam optimiser from <math id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1\mathrm{e}^{-4}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msup id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">e</mi><mrow id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mo id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3a" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">1</cn><apply id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">e</ci><apply id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><minus id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">4</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">1\mathrm{e}^{-4}</annotation></semantics></math> to <math id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1\mathrm{e}^{-6}" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msup id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">e</mi><mrow id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mo id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3a" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">−</mo><mn id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">6</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><times id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">1</cn><apply id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">e</ci><apply id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3"><minus id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3"></minus><cn type="integer" id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.2">6</cn></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">1\mathrm{e}^{-6}</annotation></semantics></math>.

CRs in real eye images have at least two further important features: 1) The CR in an eye image is normally heavily oversaturated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>; and 2) depending on the physical geometry of the setup and the orientation of the eye, the CR is often overlaid on a non-uniform background, such as the iris or the edge of the pupil. We, therefore, extend the approach of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> by introducing saturation that truncates the Gaussian distribution and leaves it with an area of maximum brightness surrounded by shallow tails, and by introducing a non-uniform background.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Since the aim of the current work is to develop a high-accuracy CR center localization method, it is important to develop a model of what accuracy an optimal localization method could achieve. As shown by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, CR localization accuracy depends on the number of pixels spanned by the CR in the image as well as the shape of the light distribution.
Theoretically, the lower the spatial pixel resolution or bit-depth of the CR image, the lower is the maximum achievable localization accuracy of the CR center.
This follows from the logic that the coarser the digital representation of the CR, the bigger the change in its position needs to be before an observable change occurs in the CR image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">[</span>, <span id="S2.SS3.SSS2.p1.2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cf</span>.,]</cite>]mulligan1997. Therefore, to provide a benchmark for the results presented in this paper, we determined the theoretically optimal center localization performance as a function of CR size and Gaussian amplitude (i.e. tail width).

<div id="S2.SS4.SSS2.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.SSS2.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Image analysis was performed frame-wise. A first stage was performed using the steps described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Briefly, an analysis ROI and fixed pupil and CR thresholds were set manually for each participant’s videos to identify the pupil and CR in the images, as is commonly performed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. We ran the analyses at different CR and pupil thresholds and selected the thresholds that maximized the precision of the signals. These thresholds were used to binarize the images and after morphological operations to fill holes, the pupil and CR were selected based on shape and size criteria. The center of the pupil and CR were then computed as the center of mass of the binary blobs. The CR center provided by this method will be referred to as the CR center localized using the thresholding method.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.SSS2.Px3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.SSS2.Px3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In a second stage, a 180×180 pixel cutout centered on the center location identified by the thresholding method was made. A black circular mask with a radius of 48 pixels (about three times the horizontal size of the CR blob) was furthermore applied to the input image (see right panel in Figure <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Dataset one ‣ 2.4.2 Evaluation on real eye-images ‣ 2.4 Evaluation ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). These masked images were then fed into the radial symmetry and CNN methods and their indicated CR centers stored.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.SSS2.Px3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.SSS2.Px3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To assess whether our method also works on lower resolution eye images as may be delivered by other eye tracking setups, we reran the image analysis described above with all input images downsampled by a factor of 2. The processing method and parameters were identical to those for the full resolution eye videos, except that the radius of the black circular mask applied to the CNN’s input images was also halved.</p>

The same formula was applied to compute the horizontal and vertical gaze positions. The accuracy of the gaze signal was then computed for each trial as the offset between the median estimated gaze location and the fixation point location for the data of task 4 in dataset one and task 3 in dataset two. The accuracy values for the repeated fixations on the 15 fixation targets were averaged. Similarly to the CR and pupil center signals, RMS-S2S and also STD precision of the gaze signal was computed in moving 200-ms windows for all the collected gaze data, after which for each trial the median RMS or STD value from all these windows was taken.</p>

As can be seen, appreciable errors in CR center location occur at all examined Gaussian amplitudes for the smallest CR size (2), and also for CR size 4 for higher Gaussian amplitudes (i.e. images containing narrower tails). Furthermore, error increases as a function of Gaussian amplitude (narrower tails). To illustrate how close the different CR center localization methods are to their optimal performance, the results of this examination will be used as reference lines when presenting the evaluation on synthetic images in the “<a href="#S3.SS2" title="In 3 Results ‣ Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_nameref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_title">Evaluation on synthetic CRs</span></a>” section below.</p>

As can be seen, for the smallest CR size, the CNN and thresholding methods perform similarly, while the radial symmetry method shows a larger bias towards the left of the image, which is the gray side. As CR size increases, this bias towards the grey side of the image for the radial symmetry method only slightly decreases. For these larger CR sizes, the center localization output of the threshold and CNN methods becomes more smooth, and the CNN by and large shows a lower error than the threshold method.</p>

As can be seen, error in localization is almost independent of CR size for the threshold and CNN methods while error decreases as a function of CR size for the radial symmetry method. The thresholding and CNN methods are not affected by noise in the input image in the range that we examined and achieve similar CR center localization error. On the other hand, the radial symmetry method was strongly affected by pixel noise level (errors were mostly over 0.5 pixels at noise level 8 and ranged from 3–8 pixels at noise level 18, not shown). As such, further plots show results at noise level 0 to highlight the best possible performance of the radial symmetry method.</p>

While there were differences in overall noise level between participants, a clear pattern in results for the CR center localization methods is seen. The CNN method consistently delivers signals with a better precision (lower values) than the thresholding method, while the radial symmetry method delivers signals with worse precision (higher values). Precision of the pupil center signal is consistently much worse than that of the CNN- or thresholding-based CR center signals. It is important to note here that all methods processed each video frame independently, and that improved precision could thus not be due to any form of temporal information being used from previous or future frames <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">[</span>, c.f.]</cite>]niehorster2020apparent,niehorster2020characterizing.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have developed a CNN architecture and training regime for localizing single CRs in eye images. We have furthermore analyzed the spatial accuracy and precision obtained with this new method using synthetic and real eye images. Regarding the research questions posed in the introduction, the contributions of this paper are: that 1) we provide a simple method using only synthetic images to train a CNN to perform CR center localization and demonstrate that a CNN trained using this method can perform CR center localization in real eye images; 2) we show that our method is able to locate the CR center similarly accurately as a commonly used algorithmic approach when applied to synthetic data; and 3) we demonstrate that our method can outperform algorithmic approaches to CR center localization in terms of spatial precision when applied to real eye images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, the paper has shown that our CNN-based method consistently outperforms the popular thresholding method for CR center localization as well as the radial symmetry method that was recently adopted by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. As <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> have recently shown, binarizing an eye image using a thresholding operation reduces the CR center localization accuracy compared to methods that use the full range of pixel intensity values in the image of the CR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">[</span>, c.f. also]</cite>who show this in the context of microscopy]helgadottir2019digital. The radial symmetry method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> uses the full range of intensity values and has been shown to outperform thresholding for localization of the center of image features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bibx37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. However, these results were obtained with features on a uniform background. Our simulations show that the radial symmetry method is consistently considerably worse when used on images with a background consisting of two regions with different luminance. It is therefore not suitable for use in more general eye tracking scenarios, where the CR is often overlaid on a non-uniform background, such as the iris or the edge of the pupil.
In contrast, our CNN was trained on highly simplified images that contained such backgrounds, and shows performance that is robust to their presence in both synthetic and real eye images. This demonstrates that the CNN approach, if appropriately trained, is able to use the pixel intensity information contained in the image of the CR to localize its center while effectively ignoring the background. Our CNN method consistently outperformed the other methods across evaluations performed on two different datasets and also when fed eye images that were downsampled to half resolution, showing that the method is applicable to many participants with differing eye physiology and generalizes to lower resolution eye images.

<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This paper has demonstrated that simple simulations can be used to effectively train deep learning models that work on real eye images, raising questions about the need for heavy data augmentation techniques and time-consuming data collection as well as hand labeling efforts or reconstruction methods. However, it is worth emphasizing that we have so far employed this approach only on high quality eye images (see Figure <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ Dataset one ‣ 2.4.2 Evaluation on real eye-images ‣ 2.4 Evaluation ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>) encountered in high-end lab-based eye tracking scenarios where researchers are interested in microsaccades and other fixational eye movements, as well as other aspects of eye movements that require high data quality, such as slow pursuit. While our approach shows promise for these research scenarios, other scenarios in which eye trackers are frequently applied such as virtual reality or wearable eye tracker settings face eye images of significantly worse quality. Our approach should thus be tested on more challenging targets (e.g. localizing the center of the pupil or iris), more complex situations (e.g. involving multiple CRs and spurious reflections) and images of lower quality to further test the hypothesis that effective gaze estimation methods in a broader context can be trained using simple simulations alone.</p>

<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our results indicate that our method for training deep learning models for eye tracking applications using only simple synthetic images shows great promise. However, much of the road ahead to a fully deep-learning based eye tracking method trained using only synthetic images remains unexplored. As the next endeavor, we plan to extend our approach to localization of the pupil center. If successful, this will not only provide a much needed improvement in precision of the pupil signal that will translate into increased quality of the P-CR gaze signal, but will also provide a further and more ambitious test of the hypothesis that effective gaze estimation methods can be trained using simple simulations alone. Why does localizing the pupil center provide a more ambitious test? While a CR has approximately the same size, shape and pixel intensity profile in all eye images for a given eye tracking setup and is thus easy to design a representative simulation for, this is not the case for the pupil. The luminance of the pupil in the eye image can vary significantly, and its apparent shape can change radically as it changes size, is imaged from different angles when the eye rotates and one or multiple CRs overlap it.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We further plan to develop our framework to handle more challenging tasks such as detecting multiple CRs and matching their positions in the eye image to the corresponding physical configuration of light sources, similar to the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. This would enable using our method to be used in eye tracking scenarios outside of laboratory settings.</p>
