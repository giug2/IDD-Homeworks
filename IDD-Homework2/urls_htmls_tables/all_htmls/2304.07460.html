<p id="1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning framework that enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a global model while keeping raw data locally. Although FL avoids leaking direct information from local datasets, sensitive information can still be inferred from the shared models. To address the privacy issue in FL, differential privacy (DP) mechanisms are leveraged to provide formal privacy guarantee. However, when deploying FL at the wireless edge with over-the-air computation, ensuring client-level DP faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless FL scheme called private federated edge learning with sparsification (PFELS) to provide client-level DP guarantee with intrinsic channel noise while reducing communication and energy overhead and improving model accuracy. The key idea of PFELS is for each device to first compress its model update and then adaptively design the transmit power of the compressed model update according to the wireless channel status without any artificial noise addition. We provide a privacy analysis for PFELS and prove the convergence of PFELS under general non-convex and non-IID settings. Experimental results show that compared with prior work, PFELS can improve the accuracy with the same DP guarantee and save communication and energy costs simultaneously.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm in which edge devices collaboratively learn a shared model under the orchestration of a central server while keeping data locally<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. It has gained significant attention because of its inherent privacy preservation and higher efficiency in comparison with conventional centralized ML, which relies heavily on a trustworthy and powerful central server for model training. Specifically, in each communication round, FL consists of four basic stages: (i) the central server sends the current global model to the selected edge devices; (ii) edge devices update their models using the local training data; (iii) edge devices transmit their model updates back to the central server; and (iv) the central server aggregates devices’ updates into a new global model. This process is repeated for multiple communication rounds until the global model converges with a satisfactory accuracy. Although FL only requires the transmission of model updates between edge devices and the server instead of raw data, such model transfer can become a communication bottleneck, especially when dealing with modern deep neural networks (DNNs) that has a huge number of parameters (e.g., on the order of hundreds MB, or even GB) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the transmit power of edge devices is often limited in FL. Thus, it is crucial to design transmission protocols that are both communication and energy-efficient in FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When deploying FL over wireless edge, wireless FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> where edge devices under the coverage of a nearby access point are coordinated by its co-located edge server to perform FL has been proposed. In wireless FL, the uplink transmissions for model uploading are particularly challenging due to the shared nature of wireless medium among all participating devices. Orthogonal multiple access techniques such as time-division multiple access (TDMA), code-division multiple access (CDMA), and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) are often used to share the wireless spectrum among the devices. However, as the number of edge devices in wireless FL increases, the spectrum resource that can be allocated to each device decreases proportionally, leading to high latency and low quality of model update transmissions from edge devices to the server. Therefore, enabling scalable FL over wireless edge with a large number of edge devices and limited spectrum resource is very challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the challenge associated with communication, privacy is another core challenge in wireless FL. Although edge devices in wireless FL keep their data locally and only exchange ephemeral model updates that contain less information than raw data, this is not sufficient to guarantee data privacy. For example, by observing the model updates from an edge device, it is possible for the adversary to recover the private dataset in that device using reconstruction attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> or infer whether a sample is in the dataset of that device using membership inference attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Specifically, if the server is not fully trusted, it can easily infer the private information of edge devices from the received model updates during the training by employing existing attack methods. Therefore, how to defend against those advanced privacy attacks and provide rigorous privacy guarantee for each device in wireless FL without a fully trusted edge server is challenging and needs to be addressed. As the state-of-the-art privacy notion, differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> can ensure formal and rigorous privacy protection in FL by adding random noise to the shared model updates. However, the existing DP mechanisms could severely degrade the model accuracy in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. How to achieve a strong DP guarantee while maintaining high model accuracy is still challenging in wireless FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Over-the-air computation (AirComp) provides a promising solution to addressing both of the aforementioned spectrum and privacy challenges in an integrated manner by achieving scalable and bandwidth-efficient model update aggregation in wireless FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. The basic idea of AirComp is to create and leverage the inter-user interference in the multiple access channel (MAC) to boost throughput. In applying AirComp to wireless FL, devices send their model updates in an uncoded manner by directly mapping each model update parameter to a channel symbol: each device first precodes the transmitted symbols by the inverse of the uplink channel gain and then transmits the precoded symbols to the edge server in an analog manner. All the participating devices transmit simultaneously on the same channel so that their signals are aligned and decoded to obtain desired arithmetic computation results at the edge server. In comparison with the traditional orthogonal multiple access techniques where computing and communications are separately done, AirComp is a joint compute-and-communicate scheme by exploiting the fact that MAC inherently yields an additive superposed signal. Note that by using AirComp in wireless FL, the uplink transmission rate of each device does not degrade as the number of devices increases, making it more scalable. Furthermore, the superposition property of wireless channels in AirComp provides an additional benefit to privacy protection. Specifically, by using AirComp in wireless FL, the edge server will only receive from all participating devices the superposition of transmitted signals computed from their private datasets. From the privacy perspective, this makes it harder for the edge server to infer each device’s private dataset since the edge server does not know the transmitted signal from each individual device. Moreover, the channel noise naturally perturbs the received signal at the edge server and contributes to privacy protection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider the problem of FL with AirComp subject to client-level DP guarantee and aim to design a differentially private wireless FL scheme with high model accuracy and low communication and energy overhead. The first key challenge is the large noise magnitude required for protecting the privacy of each individual model update against attackers, which is proportional to the model dimension and results in a significantly degraded model accuracy. To address it, we propose to first compress the model update for reducing its model dimension and then use the compressed model update to design the transmit signal. As shown later, both model compression and the signal-superposition nature of wireless channel can reduce the noise magnitude required to provide a certain DP guarantee and achieve higher model accuracy. The second challenge is that when adding artificial noise to the local model updates for privacy protection, devices need to consume more energy for transmitting the noisy model updates to the server via AirComp as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. If a strong DP guarantee is required, the additional energy consumption imposes a significant overhead on the energy-constrained edge device. Rather than adding artificial noise to the model updates when designing the transmit signal, we propose to adapt the transmit power and harness the channel noise in AirComp to naturally perturb the received signal at the server and provide intrinsic privacy.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the communication efficiency over wireless multiple-access channels in FL, AirComp-based FL has been proposed as a promising strategy by simultaneously transmitting model updates from all devices to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Specifically, Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> considered an analog transmission strategy in FL, where each device is scheduled for transmission depending on the channel condition to improve the learning performance in the presence of fading channels. Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a joint device selection and beamforming design while guaranteeing the mean squared error (MSE) to improve the learning task performance. Amiri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed an algorithm in which devices pre-process the analog model updates through sparsification and quantization before transmissions. They further modify the analog communication scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, where the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates, and project the resultant error into a low-dimensional vector and transmit only the important gradient entries while accumulating the error from previous iterations. By taking gradient statistics into account, a gradient aware power control algorithm is developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to minimize the aggregation error. However, all of the aforementioned works did not consider the privacy issue when the central edge server is not trustworthy in AirComp-based FL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate the privacy risks for the model updates shared by the devices in AirComp-based FL, some recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> adopted AirComp-based FL with DP to prevent the privacy leakage by injecting random noise into the released model updates. In particular, the previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> utilized artificial noise to provide privacy guarantee when the inherent channel noise is not sufficient to satisfy the DP requirement. Accordingly, these strategies may lead to more energy consumption by transmitting artificial Gaussian noise. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, an energy-efficient approach is proposed to scale down the transmit power instead of injecting artificial noise. Inspired by that, an adaptive power allocation scheme was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to achieve DP by utilizing intrinsic channel noise in both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) channels. Nevertheless, both works considered the full gradients transmission. Therefore, the communication cost is high due to the high dimension of DNNs. Meanwhile, to provide an unbiased estimation of model updates in AirComp-based FL, the updates need to be aligned by a coefficient related to the channel and power conditions before transmission <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Since both works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> considered the full device participation, their power alignment coefficients are limited by the device with the worst channel and power condition. Furthermore, aforementioned works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> consider record-level DP, which protects the presence of a single data sample. As elaborated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, it makes more sense to consider the notion of client-level DP in FL, which protects the presence of a device’s entire dataset and is more challenging to achieve. Our work aims to achieve client-level DP while ensuring a high level of model accuracy in DNNs by jointly exploiting the opportunities of model compression and adaptive power control.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider the edge server to be “honest-but-curious”. That is, the edge server is curious about a specific device’s local dataset and intends to infer information from the shared messages, but honestly follows the protocols involving the training process. Moreover, there may exist a third party that can observe the global model broadcasted by the server in each round.
The privacy goal of this paper is to ensure that the edge server or third party cannot infer much about a device’s local dataset by observing the received global model update in each round.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we propose a new wireless FL scheme named Private Federated Edge Learning with Sparsification (PFELS) to achieve client-level DP while keeping high model accuracy and improving communication and energy efficiency at wireless edge. We also formulate the optimal power control design in PFELS as a constrained optimization problem.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce communication cost and energy consumption, the key idea of PFELS is that each device sparsifies the model update first before transmitting it to the server via wireless MAC. Moreover, rather than adding artificial noise to the local model updates for privacy protection, which will consume extra transmission energy, PFELS relies on the inherent channel noise and adaptive power scaling to achieve DP in FL.</p>

Consequently, WFL-P can achieve higher model accuracy compared to PFELS in this case.
Note PFELS sparsifies the local model updates before transmitting them to reduce the total convergence error while respecting the power and privacy constraints. This clearly shows the benefit of sparsification in improving the privacy-accuracy trade-off in wireless FL.</p>

This is due to the fact that PFELS uses compression to balance the trade-off between the privacy error and compression error and achieves a better convergence speed. Second, WFL-P has a faster convergence speed in terms of communication round than WFL-PDP because WFL-PDP needs to consider the additional DP constraint besides the same power constraint as in WFL-P. Third, Fig. <a href="#S8.F5.sf3" title="In Figure 5 ‣ 8.2.3 Communication Efficiency Benefits of PFELS ‣ 8.2 Experimental Results ‣ 8 Numerical Evaluation ‣ Communication and Energy Efficient Wireless Federated Learning with Intrinsic Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5c</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S8.F5.sf4" title="In Figure 5 ‣ 8.2.3 Communication Efficiency Benefits of PFELS ‣ 8.2 Experimental Results ‣ 8 Numerical Evaluation ‣ Communication and Energy Efficient Wireless Federated Learning with Intrinsic Privacy" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5d</span></a> show the training loss and test accuracy w.r.t. the communication cost for PFELS and baselines.

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed PFELS, a novel wireless FL scheme aimed at achieving client-level DP while maintaining high model accuracy and improving communication and energy efficiency by harnessing the intrinsic channel noise, signal-superposition nature of the wireless channel, and update compression in AirComp. Furthermore, we have analyzed the convergence and privacy properties of PFELS under the general non-convex and non-iid setting. Experimental results have demonstrated that compared with prior wireless FL frameworks, PFELS can greatly improve the model accuracy, communication and energy efficiency simultaneously under the same DP guarantee. In the future, we will investigate other compression methods and extend our algorithm to the setting with imperfect channel status.</p>
