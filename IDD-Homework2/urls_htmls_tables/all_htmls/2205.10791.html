<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Increasing concerns on intelligent spectrum sensing call for efficient training and inference technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning (FL) framework, dubbed federated spectrum learning (FSL), which exploits the benefits of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and overcomes the unfavorable impact of deep fading channels. <span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Distinguishingly, we endow conventional RISs with spectrum learning capabilities by leveraging a fully-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model at each RIS controller, thereby helping the base station to cooperatively infer the users who request to participate in FL at the beginning of each training iteration.</span> To fully exploit the potential of FL and RISs, we address three technical challenges: RISs phase shifts configuration, user-RIS association, and wireless bandwidth allocation. The resulting joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user-RIS association design is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the system utility while considering the impact of FL prediction accuracy. In this context, the accuracy of FL prediction interplays with the performance of resource optimization.
In particular, if the accuracy of the trained CNN model deteriorates, the performance of resource allocation worsens.
The proposed FSL framework is tested by using real radio frequency (RF) traces and numerical results demonstrate its advantages in terms of spectrum prediction accuracy and system utility: a better CNN prediction accuracy and FL system utility can be achieved with a larger number of RISs and reflecting elements.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Sixth-generation (6G) networks are envisioned to provide new services and applications to the users. Due to the limited spectrum resources, spectrum sensing, which is defined as the task of ascertaining the spectrum usage and the activity of mobile users, has become urgent and meaningful to improve the spectrum usage efficiency and address the spectrum scarcity problem in heterogeneous wireless networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For instance, the desire for better spectrum utilization has triggered spectrum sharing such as the coexistence of WiFi and Long Term Evolution (LTE) in unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
However, large-scale dynamical networks
lead to spectrum characteristics uncertainty, which entails great difficulty in robust and accurate spectrum sensing. To address this challenge, deep learning (DL) has been employed to intelligently identify the spectrum characteristics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Specifically, learning deep features from the radio frequency (RF) signals via appropriately offline trained deep neural networks (DNNs) has become popular <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that, in traditional DL-based spectrum sensing methods, pre-trained DNNs that detect RF signals usually need to be fine-tuned or even re-trained once the spectrum occupancy changes significantly. As for the training of DNNs, conventional centralized training approaches (e.g., training at a central cloud) that require uploading a large amount of raw data may not be feasible in practice due to the limited communication bandwidth, data privacy and security concerns. In this case, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a suitable solution to leverage personalized dataset from a large number of mobile users in order to collaboratively train a shared DNN in a decentralized way, while achieving differential data locality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. In each iteration of FL (called round), the users train their local models based on their own data and then upload, via wireless links, the model updates to an edge server where the global aggregation is performed.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the depicted context, several new research challenges emerge for the conventional FL process:</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Challenge-1:</span> Before the start of local training at each iteration of the conventional FL process, the edge server first needs to perform resource allocation (such as users selection and bandwidth allocation) by solving the corresponding optimization problem. Due to the existence of shadowing and multi-path fading in radio environments, some users may not be able to reliably send their requests to the base station (BS) via the direct links, which may be severely degraded and then unreliable. In this case, the BS cannot perform the resource allocation well since some of the requests may be missed.</p>

Due to the possible unreliability of the wireless direct links and the limited wireless bandwidth, the convergence of FL may be degraded because of the low efficiency of uploading the local models. In this case, the accuracy of FL prediction may be degraded since some of the local models may be received unsuccessfully at the BS.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To address the aforementioned challenges in conventional FL implementations, emerging and advanced technologies such as terahertz (THz) communications and ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), can be exploited to improve the wireless transmission. However, excessive hardware costs and energy consumption pose design challenges due to the relatively high operating frequency of THz communications and the large number of RF chains required. In recent years, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), benefited from breakthroughs on the fabrication of programmable metasurfaces, have emerged as a promising technology for improving the quality of wireless links and for configuring the wireless environment by, e.g., appropriately reflecting the incident signals with the aid of a large number of nearly-passive reflecting elements with low power consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Recently, innovative RIS technologies improving wireless communications with low cost and energy consumption have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. For example, holographic MIMO surfaces (HMIMOS) attracted great research attention as a possible solution for realizing massive MIMO systems at a lower cost and power consumption <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
In addition, to collect users’ training requests subject to deep fading conditions, cooperative RF spectrum sensing constitutes a promising approach for improving the sensing performance by capitalizing on the spatial sensing diversity of distributed sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Motivated by these considerations, it is desirable to address the two mentioned challenges of FL by integrating FL with RISs, thereby achieving cooperative RF spectrum sensing (to improve the performance of optimization) and enhancing the quality of the wireless links (to improve the accuracy of FL prediction) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. </span></p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, some researchers have investigated the potential benefits of using RISs for improving the performance of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. In these papers, however, the considered system scenarios are limited to a single-RIS setup, and the user-RIS association problem was not relevant.
A more complex and general FL system has been investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, where multiple RISs are deployed for performance enhancement. However, none of the above existing works explored the interplay between FL and RISs. Thus, this motivates us to design a novel federated spectrum learning (FSL) framework, thereby achieving efficient spectrum learning for wireless edge networks.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In wireless networks, the potential opportunities offered by the distributed FL paradigm have not been fully exploited, mainly because of the straggler effect and the unreliability of wireless channels under limited wireless resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Due to the unreliability of wireless channels, in particular, it may be difficult to receive correct local updates at the edge, especially when the wireless channel undergoes deep fading. As a result, the convergence performance of FL may be degraded. In this context, it is imperative to improve the FL performance from the communications perspective <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.

To mitigate the straggler effect, Yang <span id="S1.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed a fast global model aggregation approach to improve the performance and the convergence rate of FL via over-the-air computation (AirComp). Since uploading of the local parameters at every iteration is often inefficient in FL, Wang <span id="S1.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> presented a control algorithm that determines the best tradeoff between local update and global aggregation so as to minimize the loss function of FL.</p>

In the considered FSL framework subject to limited wireless resources and a limited number of RISs, specifically, we formulate a joint user-RIS association, phase shifts design, and wireless bandwidth allocation problem, whose goal is to maximize the FL system utility.
To solve the user-RIS association problem, we propose a matching game-based association scheme in which the users who achieve larger gains in terms of achievable SNR have higher probabilities to be associated with an RIS. The optimized phase shifts guarantee that the achieved gain of each user served by the RISs is maximized.

In the considered FL wireless network, specifically, only some users may send requests (called requested users) to participate in the training procedure of FL. Therefore, it is necessary to identify them and to appropriately allocate the available resources (e.g., wireless bandwidth) for maximizing the FL performance. In the proposed FSL framework, the requested users are inferred with the aid of neural networks deployed at the controller of the RISs. The latter neural networks are in turn trained by leveraging an FL framework that relies on the availability of RISs for reliable data transmission. These two phases are intertwined and, therefore, each training iteration of the proposed FSL framework consists of two stages: 1) the RIS-aided resource allocation stage, and 2) the RIS-aided FL training stage.</span></p>

In the RIS-aided federated training stage shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I-C Contributions and Organizations ‣ I Introduction ‣ Federated Spectrum Learning for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Aided Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b), given to the allocated resources, the CNN model available at the RISs’ controllers are further trained with the aid of FL, where the requested users upload their local model parameters via RISs-aided wireless links. It is worth noting that FL training and resource allocation (or optimization) are two intertwined problems, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-B Design Basics ‣ II Federated Spectrum Learning Framework ‣ Federated Spectrum Learning for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Aided Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
In particular, if the resource allocation cannot yield an optimal solution, i.e., the wireless bandwidth is not appropriately allocated to the requested users, then the accuracy of the CNN model trained via FL worsens. If the accuracy of the trained CNN model deteriorates, in turn, the performance of resource allocation worsens. Indeed, this is a typical ‘chicken-and-egg’ issue. To address this issue, we propose the FSL framework by leveraging a fully-trained CNN model at each RIS controller and by jointly optimizing the user-RIS association, the phase shifts configuration and the wireless bandwidth allocation.</span></p>

Here, we consider an intuitive application scenario - the coexistence of multiple wireless systems, in which the wireless spectrum learning problem must be appropriately designed and addressed. Specifically, we suppose that two different wireless systems, such as WiFi and LTE-U systems, share the same unlicensed band and there exists interference between the two systems. To coordinate a fair share of the spectrum without causing undesired interference, improved wireless spectrum sensing and signal identification to detect spectrum users are needed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. However, traditional power estimation and spectrum sensing can only detect whether the spectrum is occupied or not as in energy detection. To address this issue, the proposed FSL framework achieves appropriate wireless resources coordination of the two systems via RISs-enabled cooperative spectrum sensing, where the CNN model deployed at the RIS controllers for RF spectrum learning is trained via FL.</span></p>

Specifically, due to the limited number of RISs available in practice, only a subset of users may be allowed to upload, at each iteration, their local FL model parameters to the BS with the aid of RISs. Moreover, since the data samples of each user are usually non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), the BS generally prefers to include more users’ FL models to generate a converged FL model. Hence, the FL performance will be significantly affected by the user-RIS association and the wireless bandwidth allocation.</p>

These gains stem from the fact that a matching scheme is developed for user-RIS association to maximize the number of users served by RISs. Meanwhile, to compensate for the loss of users that are not associated with RISs, the proposed FSL scheme allocates appropriate wireless bandwidth for each user to increase the received local FL model parameters hence improving the prediction accuracy.</p>

As the number of users continues to increase by contrast, the
system utility decreases slowly. This is mainly due to the fact that the allocated wireless bandwidth for each user decreases and the communication delay becomes large.

One can observe from Fig. <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ V-C2 Prediction accuracy versus the number of training samples ‣ V-C Prediction Accuracy ‣ V Simulation Resutls and Discussions ‣ Federated Spectrum Learning for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Aided Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> that the system utility of all the considered schemes first increases with the number of RISs and then remains stable. As the number of reflecting elements of each RIS increases, the system utility can be further improved.
This is due to the fact that, with more RISs with a larger number of reflecting elements, the RIS can generate more accurate passive reflective beamforming for the incident signals, thereby effectively improving the propagation conditions. Therefore, the edge server is capable of allowing more users to participate in FL so as to improve the system utility. In addition, since the benchmark scheme has a relatively high probability of failing to choose the optimal user-RIS association, we observe that the gap between the benchmark and the proposed FSL schemes becomes significant, especially when the number of RISs is large.</p>

This phenomenon is further demonstrated in Figs. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-D1 System utility versus number of users ‣ V-D FL System Utility ‣ V Simulation Resutls and Discussions ‣ Federated Spectrum Learning for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Aided Wireless Edge Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>(e)-(f), where a network with four RISs is considered.
This is because a too large learning rate
increases the oscillation while a too small learning rate leads to over-fitting.
Therefore, an appropriate learning rate needs to be carefully selected in the proposed FSL framework based on the number of RISs.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, we explored the symbiotic interplay between federated learning and RISs. To achieve wireless spectrum learning in RISs-aided wireless edge networks, we proposed a novel FSL framework by jointly optimizing the phase shifts, user-RIS association and wireless bandwidth allocation. Simulation results demonstrated the advantages of the proposed FSL framework in terms of spectrum prediction accuracy and system utility. The proposed FSL framework can be further explored to empower conventional RIS-aided networks with distributively-yet-intelligently ‘think-and-decide’ mechanisms.</p>
