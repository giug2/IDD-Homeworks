<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper looks into the problem of handling imbalanced data in a
multi-label classification problem. The problem is solved by proposing
two novel methods that primarily exploit the geometric relationship
between the feature vectors. The first one is an undersampling
algorithm that uses angle between feature vectors to
select more informative samples while rejecting the less informative
ones. A suitable criterion is proposed to define the informativeness
of a given sample. The second one is an oversampling algorithm that
uses a generative algorithm to create new synthetic data that respects
all class boundaries. This is achieved by finding <em id="id13.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">no man’s land</em>
based on Euclidean distance between the feature vectors. The efficacy
of the proposed methods is analyzed by solving a generic multi-class
recognition problem based on mixture of Gaussians. The superiority of
the proposed algorithms is established through comparison with other
state-of-the-art methods, including SMOTE and ADASYN, over ten
different publicly available datasets exhibiting high-to-extreme data
imbalance. These two methods are combined into a single data
processing framework and is labeled as “GICaPS” to highlight the role of
geometry-based information (GI) sampling and Class-Prioritized
Synthesis (CaPS) in dealing with multi-class data imbalance problem,
thereby making a novel contribution in this field.</p>

including deep learning approaches are typically designed to perform
well when the distribution of data among classes is balanced.

disproportionately smaller share coming from the <em id="S1.p1.1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">minority</em>
class(es). Spam filtering, network intrusion detection, cancer
diagnosis, detecting fraudulent transaction are some of the
applications that generate imbalanced datasets. Classifiers trained
on such imbalanced datasets are biased towards the majority class
making them unreliable for use in several cases where the minority
class is of critical interest. For instance, it is very important to
detect a fraudulent transaction even when its occurrence is rare
compared to the overall number of genuine transactions made over a
given period. Same applies to the case of medical diagnosis where a
single case of false negative (e.g., failing to detect a malignant
tumor) can lead to serious consequences even when the overall
classifier accuracy is more than 99%. Many of these applications
exhibit high-to-extreme class imbalance where the
majority-to-minority class ratio could be more than 10,000:1
thereby, posing serious learning challenges for classifier design

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the existing methods for dealing with
imbalanced data can be broadly classified into three categories:
<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data-level methods</em>, <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">algorithm-level methods</em> and
<em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">hybrid</em> approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>

<em id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Data-level methods</em> focus on improving the dataset by using
methods such as over- or under-sampling, feature selection etc. Some
of the popular data-sampling approaches include Random Over-Sampling
(ROS), Random Under-Sampling (RUS), SMOTE (Synthetic Minority
Over-Sampling Technique) and its variants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and, ADASYN
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, <em id="S1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">algorithm-level
methods</em> try to learn the imbalance data distribution from the
classes in the datasets. These methods can be further sub-grouped
into <em id="S1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cost-sensitive methods</em> and <em id="S1.p2.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ensemble methods</em>. The
former works by assigning varying cost or weight to different
instances or classifiers in the event of misclassification while the
later combines the output of multiple classifiers built on the
dichotomies created from the original dataset to improve the
classification performance. Bagging and Boosting
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> are two common
types of ensemble methods. The <em id="S1.p2.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">hybrid methods</em> combine the
advantage of data-level and algorithm-level methods and usually
employ more than one machine learning algorithms to improve the
classification accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>

algorithms have been developed to solve the binary-class data
imbalance problem which has been studied more extensively compared
to the multi-class imbalance problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. A
multi-class data imbalance problem is usually solved by using some
decomposition strategy to reduce it to a set of binary-class problems
which can be solved by using one of the above techniques

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we restrict our discussion to
sampling-based methods that form a major part of the data-level
methods for imbalanced data learning. The data-sampling methods
could be further divided into sub-groups, namely, over-sampling and
under-sampling methods. While the former aims at adding or
replicating instances of the minority class, the later focusses on
removing instances of the majority class in a given dataset to
reduce to overall data imbalance. The replication or removal of data
is either done randomly (e.g. ROS /RUS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>) or through an
intelligent algorithm (e.g. SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, ADASYN
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>). The data-sampling algorithms are designed to
address problems such as overfitting (during oversamping), loss
of valuable information (during undersampling) or the existence of
disjuncts (imbalance within a class). The problem becomes more
challenging when the dataset exhibits considerable class overlap
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Overlapping
classes have low degree of separability between the classes and the
data points on the boundaries may belong to any of the overlapping
classes. The class overlapping becomes a more serious issue in the
presence of sensor noise or outliers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
Various methods have been proposed to address the class overlapping
issue within the imbalanced data classification problem. These methods
span across the categories mentioned above with varying degree of
success. For instance, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> suggest
a one-vs-one decomposition strategy to alleviate the presence of
overlapping without modifying existing algorithms for modifying the
dataset. Similarly, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> propose a hybrid
approach that combines fuzzy SVM with a k-nearest algorithm to deal
with data imbalance and class overlapping simultaneously. Several
variants of SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> have been proposed to
address the class separability issue in imbalanced learning problems.
In another work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, authors use manifold distance
instead of Euclidean distance to improve the class separability of the
samples. In spite of these efforts, the imbalanced learning is still
considered as a challenging problem particularly when there exists
significant class overlapping.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we aim to address the problem of
class separability for a multi-class imbalanced learning problem.
This is achieved by using a combination of oversampling and
undersampling method that use geometric information sampling and
class prioritized synthesis that not only improves the separability
between classes but also increases the diversity of samples within
each class by selectively removing redundant samples. The proposed
method is, hence, termed GICaPS which is an acronym for Geometric
Information-based Sampling and Class-Prioritized Synthesis. The
undersampling approach uses distance in the polar (angular)
coordinates to remove data points from a majority while ensuring
that valuable information is not lost by constraining the removal of
samples only from other orthants (n-dimensional orthogonal
half-spaces). Similarly, the oversampling algorithm creates
synthetic data samples in a minority class that respects class
boundaries. This is ensured by avoiding data generation in regions
with high class interference, otherwise known as ‘<em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">no man’s
land</em>’. This helps in addressing the class overlapping problem which is
particularly challenging when the data has noise and outliers. The
above oversampling and undersampling approaches can be used
separately or together for a given problem. The proposed data
processing framework, called GICaPS, is shown to provide superior
classification results compared to many of the existing
state-of-the-art methods over 10 different publicly available
datasets having very high class imbalance.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Handling of imbalance data is a long-lasting problem and lots of work have been done in this area since last few decades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Based on the literature, the approaches of solving this problem can be broadly categorized into three different groups:data-level, cost-sensitive and ensemble learning approaches. Data-level approaches try to balance skewed distribution by using various resampling approaches. Again, it can be categorized into two sub-groups: undersampling and oversampling. Cost-sensitive learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> prioritizes accurate classification of minority class samples over majority class/es. Target of this approach is to generate a classification model with minimum cost and this is achieved by establishing a cost matrix in which the elements of the matrix indicate the penalty strength for the instances that are misclassified <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Ensemble learning approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> combine multiple base classifiers in order to achieve promising results on imbalanced datasets. Various hybrid models are also there in the literature that combines data-level techniques with ensemble learning, resulting into improved performance in imbalanced data classification<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Our approach of handling imbalanced data falls under the category of data-level approaches.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A majority class in an imbalanced dataset often contains a lot of redundant or less informative data which increases unnecessary computation cost and also mis-leads the classifier in predicting accuracy.
However, unlike, oversampling approaches, not much works have been done in the direction of undersampling.
One of the earliest undersampling technique used to alleviate the problem of class imbalance in the dataset is Random Under Sampling (RUS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. However, one major drawback of this approach is that it may potentially discard useful information while sampling the data. In real-life datasets, the distribution of data can be such that, it may contain data densely populated in some region and can have very sparse distribution in some other region. As RUS has almost equal probability of picking up a sample from anywhere within the distribution, the densely populated regions will remain dense even after undersampling, and the regions containing very sparse data distribution may lose very informative data.
Some research works are also performed in the direction of minimizing the effect of information loss occurs after RUS. EasyEnsemble <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and BalanceCascade <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> are two of such approaches. Another undersampling approach, commonly known as Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN), was adopted from the study of Wilson <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. ENN mainly focuses on instances near the decision boundary and selectively removes majority class instances by considering its k nearest neighbours that belong to the other class. Few extensions of this work include Neighbourhood Cleaning Rule (NCL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Another data cleaning strategy was introduced by Kubat and Matwin that uses Tomek links <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> to remove only borderline majority samples. All these aforesaid methods mainly focuses on the removal of borderline majority class data and overlooks the desire of removing unnecessary less informative and redundant data which may lie within the majority class. An attempt to remove the redundant data from the distribution of majority class set is presented in an approach commonly known as <em id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cluster centroid undersampling</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Majority class is undersampled by forming clusters and the sampled data are chosen as cluster centroids. The number of clusters is set by the level of undersampling. Few extensions of this work include <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Zhao er al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> applied an unsupervised learning algorithm that transforms the classification problem into several classification sub-problems. K-medoids based undersampling approach is applied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and only the cluster centers are considered as sampled data. Again, all these approaches can’t ensure retaining of most informative data as they replaces the real-samples with the cluster centers. In contrast, we propose an undersampling technique based on the angular information among the feature vectors of majority class, that ensures retaining of more informative data and removal of less informative or redundant data from all the regions within the distribution set.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Although data balancing can be best handled by the implication of both oversampling and undersampling approaches, however, researchers have been more frequently applying oversampling approaches to solve this problem. Lots of works have been done in data driven oversampling techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>.

As the replacement process of ROS is completely random, this approach does not specify a clear borderline between any two classes.
Moreover, simple replication of existing data into the original minority class/es can cause the problem of overfitting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Among the existing data-driven oversampling approaches, Sampling with Data Generation (SMOTE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> is still considered as the <em id="S2.SS2.p1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">state of the art</em> in the literature due to its simplicity and easy implementability. However, it is associated with various shortcomings. One important drawback of SMOTE is that, it does not consider possible interferences of data from other classes while generating synthetic examples, thereby increases the chances of multi-class overlapping and also introduces additional noises. Another major issue with the SMOTE is that, it has no control over the number of new data to be generated (it merely replicates same number of data, originally present in a minority class). Therefore, the dataset remains imbalanced even after applying SMOTE.
Over the period of time various improvements have been done on SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Some of those, include Borderline-SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach for Imbalanced Learning (ADASYN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, Ranked minority oversampling in boosting (Ramoboost) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. ADASYN is developed based on the idea of Borderline-SMOTE. Unlike SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE only creates synthetic samples for the data points which are near to the border, while taking into consideration that no synthetic data should be generated for ”Noise” instances. ADASYN adapts the concept of Borderline-SMOTE and creates different number of synthetic data based on the data distribution. Unlike, SMOTE and Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN algorithm can decide the number of synthetic examples that need to be generated for each minority examples by the number of its majority nearest neighbor, I.e., the more the majority nearest neighbor, the more synthetic examples will be created. One important drawback with this approach is that, the synthetic data is generated only near to the boundary. Secondly, It does not consider the possibility of interference of other minority or majority class data while generating synthetic data. Third, both SMOTE and ADASYN do not consider within class imbalance while generating new data. I.e, the data-intensive minority regions may still remain dense, while the data-sparse minority regions may remain sparse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. In contrast, the proposed approach of oversampling mainly focuses on the inter-class borderline data over-lapping issues and effectively localizes all the possible data over-lapping regions between any two classes and wisely avoids those regions while synthetically generating new data within the targeted minority class. In addition to that, the proposed oversampling techniques reduces within class imbalance by using K-means clustering before synthetic data generation. Some research works on oversampling techniques that attempted to reduce within class imbalance are Cluster-SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>,MWMOTE (majority weighted minority oversampling technique) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, DBSMOTE (density-based synthetic minority oversampling
technique) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, CURE-SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, and K-means SMOTE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. However, all these methods do not consider interference of other classes boundaries while interpolating data within the selected minority class.</p>

Therefore, an attempt to balancing the dataset by merely generating synthetic data in the minority classes would make the dataset huge and thereby severely impact the computation during training. We observe that in extremely imbalanced datasets, the majority classes contain many repeated/ less informative occurrences which are in fact redundant to training the classifier. Hence, GICaPS is the combination of two algorithms: <span id="S4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GICaPS-undersampling</span> and <span id="S4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">GICaPS-oversampling</span>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The intention behind applying an undersampling approach to a majority class is to get rid of the data samples those have very less impact on the training of a network. This not only helps balancing the training data, also results in significant decrease in computational burden during network training.
It is important to note that the similarity between two feature vectors is directly proportional to their dot product. Hence, by measuring the angle between two feature vectors, one can determine the dissimilarity or distinctiveness between them, which is in fact directly proportional to the angle between the vectors. The main focus of undersampling technique is to remove feature vectors from the majority class while maintaining the intra-class data diversity (as much as possible). However, maintaining diversity is difficult in random undersampling or euclidean distance based approach. Hence, we embrace a sorting technique in the angular space, where we ensure that each feature vector is distinct than the others.
The proposed undersampling algorithm works using two principles:</p>

It can be observed that, the undersampled data still covers the entire class and maintains uniformity. It removes the unnecessary data from the dataset, yet keeps all the data which are sparsely distributed. Histogram plots of angular distances for two randomly chosen clusters are shown in Figures <a href="#S4.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV-A1 GICaPS undersampling technique ‣ IV-A GICaPS undersampling approach ‣ IV Proposed Imbalanced data handling technique- GICaPS ‣ A Method for Handling Multi-class Imbalanced Data by Geometry based Information Sampling and Class Prioritized Synthetic Data Generation (GICaPS)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a> and <a href="#S4.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ IV-A1 GICaPS undersampling technique ‣ IV-A GICaPS undersampling approach ‣ IV Proposed Imbalanced data handling technique- GICaPS ‣ A Method for Handling Multi-class Imbalanced Data by Geometry based Information Sampling and Class Prioritized Synthetic Data Generation (GICaPS)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a>. It is observed that the undersampled data in each of the clustered regions are almost uniformly scattered. The redundant or the less informative features are represented either by a single feature vector or by very few of them. It is observed from the histogram plots that the over crowded regions of the original class are made compact by selecting few feature samples. These selected features are the candidates from the crowded regions, which carry important characteristics of the entire class. It is also observed from the plots that no undersampled data is present in certain bins. Such cases can only happen when the data is either lying in the same orthant of the center and another feature vector which has already been selected previously that represents the data under consideration.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It can be observed that, the distribution of the synthetically generated data is not uniform in both SMOTE and ADASYN. SMOTE interpolates data between the two existing points without even considering the interference of the majority class. Also, as SMOTE randomly decides which of the K nearest neighbor is to be selected for interpolation, it may happen that more relevant point gets missed and too many data gets interpolated between two closely placed data points. Figure <a href="#S4.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ IV-C Illustration with a simulated dataset ‣ IV Proposed Imbalanced data handling technique- GICaPS ‣ A Method for Handling Multi-class Imbalanced Data by Geometry based Information Sampling and Class Prioritized Synthetic Data Generation (GICaPS)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> shows the results of synthetic data generation for the minority class data. The observation clearly shows that the new data is generated only near to the border. Even most of the synthetically generated data falls on the territory of the majority class, which will definitely mislead the classifier. The observation gives a clear illustration that the performance of ADASYN is even worse than SMOTE. In contrast to both, the proposed approach takes every neighboring point into consideration, and equal spacing is maintained between all the points while interpolating data. Moreover, unlike SMOTE and ADASYN, the GICaPS decides how many points are to be interpolated between any neighboring points. It also decides whether to interpolate data between two points or not, based on possibility of conflict with other class boundaries.
A visualization of the GICaPS oversampling approach is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-B GICaPS oversampling approach ‣ IV Proposed Imbalanced data handling technique- GICaPS ‣ A Method for Handling Multi-class Imbalanced Data by Geometry based Information Sampling and Class Prioritized Synthetic Data Generation (GICaPS)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.</p>

Two randomly chosen class data are used for this purpose. The chosen minority class is oversampled using GICAPS-oversampling approach, SMOTE and ADASYN. Support vector machine is used to perform this experiment. Minimum distance between support vectors of two classes is calculated for each of the approaches and the same is presented in the Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-C Illustration with a simulated dataset ‣ IV Proposed Imbalanced data handling technique- GICaPS ‣ A Method for Handling Multi-class Imbalanced Data by Geometry based Information Sampling and Class Prioritized Synthetic Data Generation (GICaPS)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.

The main intension of using the angular information in the undersampling approach to remove redundant data and to avoid removal of more informative data which may not be taken care when the Euclidean distance considered as the rejection criteria. As, oversampling involves synthetic data generation, we opted to use Euclidean distance for the shake of lesser computational complexity. However, one can use angular information that will avoid generation of redundant data.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Gaussian distribution has a wide range of applicability in realistic distributions. The performance and applicability of the estimating model is further enhanced when multiple Gaussians are used in place of one to model the data distribution. In this work, the distribution of the training data is captured using Gaussian mixture model which is a linear combination of finite number of Gaussians. The recognition problem is solved as a regression problem. The class identity is predicted by the regressive model, created by the mixture of Gaussians. We select regression over the standard GMM classification because of two reasons: i) The execution time is faster when the class dimension is high and ii) we want to show that a regressive model can also perform well with the dataset created using the proposed data balancing technique.</p>

To validate the performance of the proposed data balancing technique, we compare the results with well established data handling techniques, such as SMOTE and ADASYN. It has been observed that, unlike ADASYN and GICaPS, the data distribution among classes after applying SMOTE remains skewed in most of the highly imbalanced datasets. Such an instance can be shown using the pain dataset. The distribution of data among classes after applying SMOTE, ADASYN and GICaPS are presented in Table <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:tab:pain_data_dist_smote</span>, Table <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:tab:pain_data_dist_adasyn</span> and Table <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_label ltx_ref_self">LABEL:tab:pain_data_dist_prop_app</span> respectively.

particularly in cases where minority class is of importance. This
problem is addressed in this paper by proposing a data processing
framework called GICaPS that uses <em id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">geometric information-based
sampling</em> and <em id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">class-prioritized synthesis</em> for undersampling and
oversampling data in majority and minority classes respectively. The
proposed undersampling algorithm uses an angular constraint to remove
redundant information in a majority class while ensuring that the
valuable information is not lost. This is ensured by restricting the
removal of data points only from other orthants. On the other hand,
the proposed oversampling method populates the minority class by
generating data that respects class boundaries. This is achieved by
avoiding data generation in the <em id="S7.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">no-man’s land</em> between the
classes. Mathematical expressions are derived for these constraints
and concepts, thereby providing a theoretical basis for these
algorithms. Pseudocodes for these algorithms are provided for easy
implementation. The superiority of the proposed data sampling
algorithms is established through rigorous performance comparison
analysis with the current state-of-the-art methods on 10 different
real-world datasets exhibiting high data imbalance. The future scope
of this work would involve extending these concepts to hybrid
algorithms to further improve the classification performance on
imbalance datasets.</p>
