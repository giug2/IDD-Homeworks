<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recently, federated learning (FL) has sparked widespread attention as a promising decentralized machine learning approach which provides privacy and low delay. However, communication bottleneck still constitutes an issue, that needs to be resolved for an efficient deployment of FL over wireless networks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the total convergence time of FL, by quantizing the local model parameters prior to uplink transmission. More specifically, the convergence analysis of the FL algorithm with stochastic quantization is firstly presented, which reveals the impact of the quantization error on the convergence rate. Following that, we jointly optimize the computing, communication resources and number of quantization bits, in order to guarantee minimized convergence time across all global rounds, subject to energy and quantization error requirements, which stem from the convergence analysis. The impact of the quantization error on the convergence time is evaluated and the trade-off among model accuracy and timely execution is revealed. Moreover, the proposed method is shown to result in faster convergence in comparison with baseline schemes. Finally, useful insights for the selection of the quantization error tolerance are provided.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Future wireless networks are envisioned to support ubiquitous artificial intelligent services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Conventional machine learning techniques are usually conducted in a centralized manner, where the data are uploaded and processed at a single entity, e.g., a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, the growing computing capabilities of devices have paved the way for realizing distributed learning frameworks. Among the decentralized approaches, federated learning (FL) has shown great promise in preserving data privacy and providing low delay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In FL, users collaboratively build a shared learning model, without exposing their raw data to the server or any other residual participant. The servers’ role is to redistribute the global model back to the users, while the whole procedure is repeated until the convergence of the global model. In this manner, FL is inherently privacy-preserving and reduces the communication load. However, the wireless environment imposes some distinctive challenges, owing to the limited wireless resources, unreliable links, etc., which degrade the performance of FL and need to be efficiently addressed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of wireless networks, several works examined and optimized the performance of FL in various aspects, such as model accuracy, timely execution and energy efficiency. More specifically, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, a joint learning and communication framework was proposed, in order to minimize the training loss
in the presence of packet errors, while in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> the objective was to minimize the total energy consumption by optimizing both the computation and communication resources. Moreover in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, authors focus on minimizing the convergence time of the FL process by efficiently scheduling the participating devices, while in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the convergence time was minimized by considering both the impact of training and communication. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the FL global loss function was minimized under total convergence time constraints, by jointly allocating the bandwidth and scheduling the users, while in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, the impact of various scheduling policies on the FL convergence rate was examined.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to communication bottleneck incurred by the limited bandwidth and the large size of the local training parameters, gradient compression techniques, such as quantization, have been proposed to further improve the communication efficiency in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Through this technique, a quantized version of the local model is being transmitted to the server, aiming to achieve faster communication without deteriorating the FL model accuracy. In this direction, authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, examined quantization schemes for the uplink and downlink communication in FL and rigorously proved the respective convergence rate upper bounds. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, a lossy FL scheme is introduced where both global and local updates are quantized before being transmitted, while the convergence behavior is analyzed. It is concluded that the performance loss compared to an ideal model, is negligible. Moreover, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the minimization of the convergence bound was performed, in a multiple access channel scenario of FL, while an efficient utilization of the quantization levels was proposed. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the quantization error was minimized subject to uplink transmission delay and outage constraints per round, in a wireless environment. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, authors proposed a one-bit quantization scheme for over-the-air FL, while they also examined the convergence rate under fading channels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">At this point, we clarify that none of the aforementioned works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, who applied quantization methods, focused on minimizing the total convergence time of the FL, which is a metric of paramount importance for meeting the low latency requirements of the next generation of wireless networks. Regarding the works who performed optimization methods, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> focused on minimizing the quantization error without jointly considering the computation, the communication resources, as well as the quantization policy. Specifically, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> did not consider the wireless factors, while in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the local computation time and subsequently the adjustment of users’ local CPU frequency were neglected. Therefore, guarantying fast convergence and high model accuracy of FL, when applying quantization techniques, by efficiently utilizing the available computation, radio resources and quantization strategy, is an issue that has not been yet resolved. Furthermore, the trade-off among model accuracy and fast convergence, owing to the local updates’ quantization, is not well-examined in the previous works, where the convergence rate is mainly investigated with regards to the global communication rounds and not the total evolution of time. Specifically, a large number of quantization bits may increase precision, in the expense of slow communication with the server per FL round, since the training parameters’ size also increases and leads to higher transmission delay. On the contrary, smaller quantization level may lead to slightly decreased model performance, though, with lower delay per round and potentially faster convergence. However, low precision updates may be communication efficient in terms of latency per round, but require increased number of communication rounds until convergence. Therefore, it is not evident that the utilization of few quantization bits can always lead to faster convergence, with respect to the evolution of time. The aforementioned fact is not clearly presented in the literature and needs further investigation.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Through simulations, the performance of local parameters’ quantization is evaluated. Specifically, we investigate the impact of the quantization error tolerance on the convergence time and model accuracy, while the trade-off among model accuracy and fast convergence is exhibited. In addition to this, it is shown that low precision quantization cannot always achieve fast convergence. Moreover, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization towards minimizing the convergence time, in comparison with baseline schemes. Finally, driven by the theoretical convergence analysis, we study the effects of decaying the quantization error tolerance along with the evolution of the training, instead of keeping it constant. The simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of this approach, which demonstrates increased convergence rate without model accuracy degradation. In essence, this observation coincides with the concept of “later-is-better” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, which implies that reserving FL-related resources in the early stages of the training process and spending them in the final stages, may be beneficial for the performance.</p>

Therefore, the effect of the quantization error in the early stages of the training process vanishes over time. Hence, it is discernible that during the early training rounds, the quantization error would not contribute in increasing the optimality gap.

An interpretation of this result is the following: The large number of communication rounds until convergence, which occur from the low precision quantization, prevails over the low-latency per round. Therefore, by selecting a relatively loose quantization error tolerance, which is equivalent to utilizing a few quantization bits, may not result in any gains or offer any benefits. This contradicts the fact which implies that by using a small number of quantization bits, communication efficiency is always achieved.</p>

Also, the case of <span id="S5.SS2.p1.3.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fixed bits allocation</span> leads to very high latency until convergence, without offering further accuracy gain. Therefore, it is evident that when aiming towards fast convergence of the FL process, the number of quantization bits ought to be wisely selected.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we studied and optimized the performance of FL over wireless networks by considering the quantization of the local model parameters. More specifically, we have jointly optimized the communication and computation resources, as well as the quantization bits allocation, focusing on minimizing the total convergence time of FL subject to energy constraints and quantization error tolerance. The optimization problem was coupled with the convergence analysis, aiming to control the impact of the quantization error and subsequently balance the trade-off between model accuracy and fast convergence. Simulations are conducted, where the considered trade-off is examined and the effectiveness of the proposed method in accelerating the convergence speed, is verified. Also, the results indicate that the selection of the quantization error tolerance is critical for achieving enhanced performance in FL, while efficient techniques are presented which result in increased convergence rate.</p>
