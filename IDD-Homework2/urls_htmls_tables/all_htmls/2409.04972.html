<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain technology has witnessed rapid and transformative growth in recent years, revolutionizing various industries with its decentralized architecture. In a blockchain network, mining nodes independently store and manage their local data, organizing it into blocks. These nodes then undergo a rigorous validation process, such as proof of work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, to select and add valid blocks to the global blockchain network. Once integrated, these blocks become immutable, unchangeable, and transparent to all participating nodes. With its core attributes of decentralization, immutability, transparency, and security, blockchain technology is finding widespread applications across numerous sectors, including finance, healthcare, supply chains, the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart grids <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain networks are decentralized and thus face numerous cyber threats, such as denial of service (DoS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, flooding of transactions (FoT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, brute pass (BP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. These detrimental cyberattacks aim to disrupt blockchain operations, causing delays and enabling malicious activities, such as theft and system breaches. For example, a BP attack on Kucoin, a cryptocurrency in Singapore, caused a serious consequence with a significant loss of about $281 million <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In addition, an FoT attack on Bitcoin makes its memory full of dust transactions which leads to a significant delay on Bitcoin transactions costing about $700 million <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Moreover, a DoS attack targeted Bitfinex by sending a large number of synchronization (SYN) packages, forcing the platform to suspend operations for three hours <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The rapid deployment of blockchains across vital sectors for managing sensitive data indicates that cyberattacks can directly impact and influence people’s daily lives and well-being.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Collaborative cyberattack detection (CCD) systems demonstrate their efficiency in detecting various types of cyberattacks in blockchain networks with high accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. However, these systems typically rely on federated learning, where workers must exchange raw trained models over the network. This exchange poses a significant security risk, as attackers can potentially reconstruct workers’ local datasets by intercepting these raw models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. A natural solution to this problem is to protect the raw models during transmission by either adding noise to them or encrypting the data before sending it over the network. However, encryption methods are computationally intensive and require additional communication between the central server and workers to get the results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, especially in a blockchain network where minimizing computational time in processing blocks is crucial.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these challenges, previous studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have proposed enhancing the security of federated learning by adding noise to the trained sub-models before they are transmitted to a centralized server. This approach has been shown to effectively protect models from inference attacks. However, adding noise to trained models in federated learning-based cyberattack detection in blockchain networks presents several critical challenges. First, balancing the trade-off between privacy and model accuracy is difficult, as excessive noise can degrade detection performance. Second, the additional computational and communication overhead introduced by noise complicates the efficient operation of blockchain networks, which require rapid processing and minimal latency. Furthermore, identifying the right parameters for noise addition, such as the distribution, scale, and timing, requires careful tuning and may involve complex optimization problems, particularly in diverse and dynamic blockchain environments. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has studied this problem.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel CCD system designed to enhance the security of blockchain-based data-sharing networks by addressing the critical challenges posed by noise addition in federated learning. Our approach integrates noise into the trained sub-models based on the theoretical foundations of differential privacy, before reconstructing the global model through transmission. We thoroughly investigate the impact of different noise types, i.e., Gaussian, Laplace, and Moment Accountant, on the accuracy of attack detection within the global model. This exploration is crucial, as the type and magnitude of noise significantly influence the detection accuracy, the convergence time of deep learning models in clusters, and the overall time required to generate the global model. By carefully balancing these factors, our work seeks to navigate the trade-offs between safeguarding against data leakage and maintaining system performance in terms of accuracy, convergence time, runtime, and the participation rate of clusters in the CCD model. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of different noise parameters, offering concrete recommendations for achieving optimal results in various CCD environments and clustering configurations.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the authors propose an anomaly detection machine to detect anomalies (i.e., DoS and eclipse attacks) by analyzing the blockchain network traffic. The authors propose to use an autoencoder to detect anomalies (i.e., DoS and Eclipse attacks) from data instances. The experimental results show that their approach can achieve significant reductions in time complexity - up to 66.8% during training and 85.7% during testing - while maintaining robust system performance. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the authors propose to use condition generative adversarial networks (CGAN) to generate adversarial samples (i.e., Low-rate distributed DoS attacks) from normal traffic of both public and private datasets. They then use long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to learn the relationship between samples to detect attacks. The simulation results show that with various machine learning and deep learning classifiers, the precisions can reach up to 95%. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, the authors propose to use blockchain technology to detect link flooding attacks, a new type of distributed DoS (DDoS) in blockchain networks. The authors used traceroute records to analyze and detect the attack. The simulation results show that their approach can achieve a detection rate of nearly 100%.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It can be observed that the approaches mentioned above depend on centralized algorithms, which require the aggregation of all network data onto a central server for analysis. However, blockchain technology is fundamentally decentralized, making it inherently difficult, if not impractical, to consolidate data from all nodes into a single central server for processing. Moreover, centralizing data collection introduces significant risks, including potential privacy breaches and the vulnerability of a single point of failure. As a result, these centralized approaches are neither effective nor secure for deployment in blockchain systems.</p>

The authors employ a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning technique to develop intrusion detection and blockchain to protect the privacy of systems. The simulation results with two ubiquitous datasets show that their framework can reach nearly 100% in detecting anomalies. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a data fusion approach for collaborative intrusion detection in a blockchain-based system to detect anomalies in a blockchain system. The authors design a data fusion model to analyze data groups (e.g., the KDD - a computer network cyberattack dataset) in blockchain networks. The simulation results show that their approach achieves an impressive True Positive Rate of up to 97% in detecting anomalies within blockchain-based systems. While the methods proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> may exhibit high accuracy in anomaly detection, they fall short in identifying and distinguishing the specific types of attacks concealed within those anomalies.</p>

The authors first build a blockchain network attack traffic (BNaT) dataset that includes the normal and attack behaviors of a blockchain network. They then propose a collaborative learning model based on federated learning to detect different types of attacks. The simulation and real-time experimental results show that their approach can achieve 98.6% accuracy in detecting attacks. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors propose a collaborative learning model for attack detection in smart contracts and transactions in a blockchain system. The authors collected a dataset of normal and attack behaviors in smart contracts and transactions. After that, they propose to convert the important features of transactions and smart contracts into images and then use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify attacks. The simulation and real-time experimental results show that their model can achieve an accuracy of 94% in detecting attacks in transactions and smart contracts. While the approaches in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> leverage collaborative learning models to detect attacks in decentralized blockchain networks, their reliance on transferring raw gradients among networks introduces significant vulnerabilities. This highlights the distinct advantage of the proposed model in offering a more secure and accurate detection mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the authors reveal that an inverting process can effectively reconstruct original data from raw gradients. Their experimental results clearly show that exchanging raw gradients in collaborative learning methods, such as federated learning, fails to secure the privacy of data within worker networks. Consequently, sensitive information remains vulnerable to exposure by unauthorized parties who can analyze parameter variations in the trained models, as evidenced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This underscores a critical weakness in privacy in these methods.
Therefore, in this work, unlike earlier approaches, which often rely on centralized systems or partial decentralization, we propose a fully decentralized CCD solution that uses differential privacy to train a data-leaking protection CCD model on geographically distributed CCD devices. Our solution adds a layer of data protection to individual CCD clusters, preventing any specific user’s data from being exposed or reconstructed and maintaining data integrity and security throughout the entire process.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Blockchain technology represents a transformative approach to data sharing among individuals, organizations, and governments, enabling secure and decentralized transactions without needing third-party validation. In a blockchain-based data-sharing system, multiple mining nodes collaboratively store and process data, primarily consisting of transactions generated from network traffic in an IoT environment. These transactions are aggregated into blocks, upon which the mining nodes execute the mining process - a crucial function that employs sophisticated cryptographic algorithms. This process is vital for achieving consensus across all nodes, ensuring the blockchain remains consistent, tamper-resistant, and trustworthy. Once a block is validated through the consensus mechanism, it is permanently added to the blockchain, creating an unalterable and transparent record of all transactions. Blockchain-based data sharing offers significant advantages over traditional database systems, including eliminating central control, enhanced transparency, flexible data access, ensured data integrity and immutability, scalability, and improved traceability. These attributes make blockchain a superior choice for secure and efficient data management.</p>

To ensure data authenticity and ownership, the IoT gateway also appends its digital signature to each data transaction, providing a secure and verifiable layer of authentication.</p>

The mining device performs the critical role of receiving, validating, and adding transactions to the global blockchain network. The mining nodes perform a mining process using a consensus protocol to validate the data, e.g., proof-of-work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. The validated data of a mining node that passes over the mining process will be put into a global blockchain network.

Firstly, it ensures the protection of individual data privacy by mathematically guaranteeing that the inclusion of noise limits the probability of identifying specific data points within the shared model parameters. This protection is particularly important in our system where sensitive information is distributed across multiple mining nodes, as in federated learning, where each mining node operates on local data. Secondly, this proposition strikes a critical balance between privacy and utility. While noise is essential for maintaining privacy, it can also degrade the performance of the global model.

Then, we plot the resulting 3D data points and colour code them according to their classes (normal behaviour or four types of attacks). Two important results can be noted. First, the spread and overlap of attack data points show that different attacks share some common features, which can make it harder for the CCD system to differentiate attack classes. Second, there is a clear variance between the 3D points of the same attack, reflecting the diversity in attack patterns and complicating attack detection and labeling by the CCD system.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We maintain a consistent configuration for the deep learning models across all clusters. For a fair comparison, we employ various types of deep learning networks, each configured with the same input layer, two hidden layers (each containing 128 neurons), and an output layer. The models operate with a batch size of 1024 and a learning rate of 0.0046. A collaborative learning mechanism facilitates collaborative learning among the different deep learning models in various clusters. This mechanism is implemented on an Intel computer with 8 CPUs running at 2592 MHz and 32 GB of RAM. Our collaborative learning system includes 100 clusters, each containing 1,470 samples for training. The specific deep learning model used can vary based on each test case. After the training process, a global model is generated, and a testing dataset comprising 63,000 samples is employed to evaluate the model’s attack detection accuracy.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this session, we evaluate the performance of different CCD setups without adding noise and three working clusters. We consider three ubiquitous types of machine learning models, including multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Evaluation Method ‣ IV Experiment Setup and Evaluation Method ‣ Balancing Security and Accuracy: A Novel Federated Learning Approach for Cyberattack Detection in Blockchain Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the performance in accuracy of these models.

The MLP model achieves the highest accuracy and stability at around 92.5% in comparison with those of CNN and RNN at 86.7% and 80.1%, respectively. These results demonstrate that in these experiments, the MLP model detects attacks better than CNN and RNN in the blockchain network. Based on this result, we use MLP in all clusters in the next section to consider the effects of adding noise in the CCD system.</p>

In this figure, we can observe that when the number of samples for training increases significantly from 3 clusters to 100 clusters, all of the curves converge after about 400 iterations, and the accuracy increases proportionally to the number of clusters. This is because the more clusters there are, the more samples will be added to the training model.

However, there is a slight increase in the accuracy of attack detection on BP attacks at 86% with Gaussian noise in comparison with 82% without noise. The reason is that, in this case, the DP parameters play a role as a regularization factor for the deep learning model to improve the accuracy of attack detection.</p>

In Fig. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ V-D CCD Processing Time ‣ V Experiment Results and Performance Evaluation ‣ Balancing Security and Accuracy: A Novel Federated Learning Approach for Cyberattack Detection in Blockchain Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, we can see that even though all models converge after 1,000 iterations, the computational time is different with the same number of clusters. The added noise systems also need more processing than the original without noise system. In addition, the computational time of 100 clusters is much longer than others. The reason is that the CCD systems with 100 clusters have more samples than those with other clusters. Thus, they need more time to aggregate data from all clusters in each iteration than others. In addition, we can see in this figure that the Laplace noise needs more computational time in comparison with Gaussian and MA noise. These results reveal that there are various trade-offs among the types of added noises, the number of clusters, accuracy and the convergence time.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have introduced an innovative privacy-preserving solution for Collaborative Cyberattack Detection (CCD) in blockchain networks, addressing a critical challenge in modern cybersecurity. By incorporating noise into trained models before collaborative learning, we have demonstrated a robust approach to safeguarding sensitive data while maintaining the efficacy of attack detection. Our extensive simulations evaluated the impact of different noise types, i.e., Gaussian, Laplace, and Moment Accountant, on key performance metrics such as accuracy, convergence time, and overall runtime across varying numbers of clusters. The results underscore the complex interplay between noise addition and system performance, revealing that while noise is essential for privacy, its effects must be carefully managed to avoid compromising detection capabilities. This work not only advances our understanding of the balance between data privacy and performance in CCD systems but also offers practical guidelines for optimizing these parameters in diverse environments. In future work, we will continue to explore innovative methods to enhance the protection of federated learning-based models, ensuring that local data remains secure in increasingly complex network environments. This research lays a strong foundation for future advancements in the field, paving the way for more secure, reliable, and scalable blockchain-based data-sharing systems.</p>
