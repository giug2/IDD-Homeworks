However, the components of C-ITS usually generate large amounts of data, which makes it difficult to explore data science.
Currently, federated learning has been proposed as an appealing approach to allow users to cooperatively reap the benefits from trained participants.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel <em id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Semi-asynchronous Hierarchical Federated Learning</em> (SHFL) framework for C-ITS that enables elastic edge to cloud model aggregation from data sensing.
We further formulate a joint edge node association and resource allocation problem under the proposed SHFL framework to prevent personalities of heterogeneous road vehicles and achieve communication-efficiency.
To deal with our proposed <em id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Mixed integer nonlinear programming</em> (MINLP) problem, we introduce a distributed <em id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</em> (ADMM)-<em id="id1.id1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Block Coordinate Update</em> (BCU) algorithm. With this algorithm, a tradeoff between training accuracy and transmission latency has been derived.
Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of training overhead and model performance.</p>

Specifically, the C-ITS components including vehicles, road infrastructure units, personal devices, and traffic command centers can achieve additional traffic management and convenience with the help of enhanced visions from surrounding participants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, both the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments</em> (WAVE) and the <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">European Telecommunications Standards Institute</em> (ETSI) standards have been proposed consecutively to define spectrum allocation, traffic parameters setting, and protocol stack to enable <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Quality-of-Service</em> (QoS) and security procedure for C-ITS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Several works have also studied the technologies for C-ITS. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> introduce a choreography-based service composition platform to accelerate the reuse-based development for a choreography-based urban coordinative application.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed a novel topological graph convolutional network to predict the
urban traffic flow and traffic density.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> analyze the relationship among security, QoS, and safety for vehicles in C-ITS.
In addition, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> investigate service-oriented cooperation models and mechanisms for autonomous vehicles in C-ITS.
Nevertheless, they have neglected to explore the large amounts of traffic data generated from transportation sensor networks, which is essential for advanced C-ITS applications like connected and autonomous vehicles, traffic control and prediction, and road safety. Although some attempts have been made to utilize data science for C-ITS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, there still exists various stuff challenges to be solved, such as privacy protection, computational complexity, and data heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">With the significant advance cloud computing, big data, and machine learning, intelligent transportation is a trend and requirement.
As one of the most dominant distributed machine learning technologies, <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Learning</em> (FL) has been widely studied to deal with the data science recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The FL technology allows participant devices to collaboratively build a shard model while preserving privacy data locally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Particularly, the prevalent FL algorithm, namely federated averaging, allows each device to train a model locally with its own dataset, and then transmits the model parameters to the central controller for a global aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Intuitively, FL presents a great potential for C-ITS to facilitate the large data management.
However, directly applying FL to C-ITS still faces three major deficiencies: 1) limited wireless resources; 2) high latency; 3) obliterated data diversity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Learning training at Edge networks</em> (FEL) has been regarded as a solution to facilitate the above limitations through bringing model training closer to the data produced locally. Compared with the conventional cloud centric FL approaches, the implementation of FEL can provide high wireless resources utilization since less information is required to be transmitted to the cloud. In addition, FEL has a much lower transmission latency and higher privacy than the conventional FL by making decisions at the edge nodes. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors develop an importance aware joint data selection and resource allocation algorithm to maximize the resource and learning efficiencies. Meanwhile, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> propose an adaptive federated learning mechanism in resource constrained edge computing systems. Along the FEL, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> propose a novel <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning</em> (HFEL) framework, where edge servers deployed with base stations fixedly and can upload edge aggregation model to the cloud. The above HFEL enables great potentials in low latency and energy efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, the participant C-ITS devices usually have heterogeneous resources, which lead to <em id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-independent-identically distributed</em> (non-iid) private data during the communication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The existing federated learning methods mainly utilize the synchronous model aggregation mechanism, where the central server needs to wait for the slowest device to complete the training in each communication round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. With heterogeneous data, the transmission latency of each synchronous model aggregation mechanism is unacceptable for time-sensitive devices.
In this way, several works have proposed asynchronous model aggregation methods, where only one participant device would update the global model each time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, the training round under asynchronous methods is several times than that of synchronous methods. Moreover, due to the asynchrony, gradient staleness may be difficult to control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

Specifically, the proposed SHFL framework consists of both edge and cloud layers, where each edge node aggregates all of homogeneous local models and the cloud layer aggregates parts of heterogeneous edge models. These selected nodes would update the global model once the selected slowest node finishes training, which combines the merits of both synchronous and asynchronous aggregations. For further performance enhancement, we formulate a joint edge node association and resource allocation optimization problem to prevent heterogeneous edge node personalities as well as ensure communication-efficient of the whole system. The objective function is a <em id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming</em> (MINLP) problem, which has been solved by a distributed <em id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</em> (ADMM)-<em id="S1.p7.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Block Coordinate Update</em> (BCU) algorithm.

<p id="S2.p1.15" class="ltx_p">In this work, we aim to design a novel SHFL framework for C-ITS that contains three layers, namely the cloud layer, the edge layer, and the local layer, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ II System Model ‣ Semi-asynchronous Hierarchical Federated Learning for Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Here, we consider the vehicle devices have heterogeneous data structures, namely the local datasets are non-iid. We let homogeneous devices with similar data size, network bandwidth, and QoS gather in the same edge node. Hence, the edge nodes are heterogeneous. A shared <em id="S2.p1.15.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Deep Neural Network</em> (DNN) model is distributed over the local devices, which has been trained collaboratively across the devices under their datasets.
Different from conventional FLs, the proposed SHFL framework allows devices train their data locally, homogeneous devices report their computed parameters to the same edge node synchronously, and heterogeneous edge nodes upload their models to the cloud node semi-asynchronously, which can preserve data privacy as well as improve communication efficiency.

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Since these edge nodes correspond to heterogeneous local datasets, their model updated periods various. If we adopt the synchronous aggregation model, the latency for faster training nodes is unacceptable. On the contrary, the asynchronous method has shorter round latency, however, it requires several times of training rounds than the synchronous method. Therefore, in this work, we propose a flexible semi-asynchronous aggregation method by combining the merits of both synchronous and asynchronous methods. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-B2 Cloud Model Aggregation ‣ II-B Cloud Aggregation ‣ II System Model ‣ Semi-asynchronous Hierarchical Federated Learning for Cooperative

Since the non-iid devices that connected with one edge node have a similar characteristic, the edge aggregation models are heterogeneous.
Therefore, if we directly use the cloud model to update the edge models, the personalities among edge models would be eliminated. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the cloud model would be decreased. Hence, we introduce a new edge update model based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, which defines a weight distance formula to represent the difference among different weight relatives as</p>

The goal of this work is to maximize communication-efficient via joint edge node selection and resource allocation scheduling for a SHFL based C-ITS network. To accelerate the learning process, it is desirable to select more edge nodes with larger data importance. However, to shorten the communication and computation latency, it is better to upload as fewer edge nodes as possible. As a result, the objective function that represents the tradeoff between GNVs and transmission latency can be formulated as</p>

Overall, the proposed algorithm shows a near to the full selection scheme convergence and accuracy, which can achieve better
performance than the baselines that would be discussed latter.</p>

Intuitively, the transmission latency is much lower than the total latency, which means the data training time is huge. Moreover, the transmission latency may not meet the requirements of ultra low latency C-ITS devices. Under this circumstance, we can enlarge the wireless bandwidth by some resource management technologies.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work proposes a novel SHFL framework that consists of local, edge, and cloud nodes to provide safety, traffic efficiency, and comfortable infotainment services for C-ITS. Specifically, homogeneous devices are allowed to associate with one edge node. Therefore, we adopt the synchronous aggregation model for edge nodes. On the contrary, for the heterogeneous edge aggregation models, we introduce a semi-asynchronous aggregation model for the cloud node, where parts of the fastest training edge models can be uploaded at each iteration. Moreover, we investigate an effective edge-cloud update method to keep the personalities of the edge nodes. For communication-efficiency, we propose a joint edge node association and resource allocation strategy, which illustrates a tradeoff between training accuracy and transmission latency. A distributed ADMM-BCU algorithm has been adopted to solve the proposed optimal MINLP problem. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can accelerate the training process and improve the performance for C-ITS.</p>
