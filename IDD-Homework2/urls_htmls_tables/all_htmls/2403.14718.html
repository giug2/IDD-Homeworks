<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), a large amount of data will be generated every day. Due to privacy
and security issues, it is difficult to collect all these data together to train deep learning models, thus the federated learning, a distributed machine
learning paradigm that protects data privacy, has been widely used in IoT. However, in practical federated learning, the data
distributions usually have large differences across devices, and the heterogeneity of data will deteriorate the performance of
the model. Moreover, federated learning in IoT usually has a large number of devices involved in training, and the limited
communication resource of cloud servers become a bottleneck for training. To address the above issues, in this paper, we combine
centralized federated learning with decentralized federated learning to design a semi-decentralized cloud-edge-device hierarchical
federated learning framework, which can mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity, and can be deployed at lage scale in IoT. To
address the effect of data heterogeneity, we use an incremental subgradient optimization algorithm in each ring cluster to improve
the generalization ability of the ring cluster models. Our extensive experiments show that our approach can effectively mitigate
the impact of data heterogeneity and alleviate the communication bottleneck in cloud servers.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, deep learning has made tremendous growth in the fields of computer vision, natural language
processing, and speech recognition<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. One of the
keys to the great success of deep learning is the large amount of available data. For deep learning, data is equivalent to
the energy power required for the operation of a factory. However, in real-world scenarios, data is usually distributed across
mobile devices or organizations. Therefore, collecting this dispersed data requires extensive communication overhead and storage
resources. Moreover, due to growing privacy concerns and stricter data regulations like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, gathering data on a cloud server for centralized training is becoming progressively more challenging

learning paradigm in 2016, known as Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Federated learning enables the training
of an enhanced global model by exchanging model parameters among devices while preserving data privacy. Federated learning has become
a important area in machine learning that has gained significant attention and widespread practical application <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>,

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning can be divided into centralized federated learning (CFL) and decentralized federated learning (DFL) according
to whether there is a cloud server to assist in training. In CFL, a cloud server is usually available to assist participants to train
a global model cooperatively. For example, FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the pioneer of federated learning, the cloud server
sends the global model to the participants for local training, and then aggregates the models uploaded by all participants to update
the global model and prepare it for the next round of training. While in DFL, the model parameters are shared among the participants
for training via peer-to-peer (P2P) manner, without involving the cloud server. The device involved in the training in CFL and DFL only
needs to send the local model parameters to the cloud server or other devices, while the original data is kept locally, thus reducing
the risk of privacy data leakage. Although the federated learning paradigm mentioned above is promising, it still faces many challenges.
For example, the distribution of data in IoT devices is typically heterogeneous, which refers to the presence of non-independent and
non-identically distributed (non-iid) data in federated learning. In brief, the data distribution varies significantly across devices.
This is because participants may be located in different geographic locations, industries or organizations and have data of various types,
formats and characteristics. The study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> pointed out that in the non-iid case, the differences between the
data distribution of each device and the global data distribution lead to the model trained by each device bias the local optimum. As a
result, the global model obtained by the server aggregating the local models of the devices in CFL has deviations from the true optimal
solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. To solve the problem of data heterogeneity, some CFL algorithms have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed FedProx to mitigate device drift by introducing
proximal terms to reduce the difference between the local model and global model. MOON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> utilizes the contrastive loss
function to enhance the consistency between the representations learned by the local model and the global model. SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>
introducs a control gradient variate to correct the drift in the local updates. In addition, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity by sharing a public dataset or synthesized data
to balance the device’s data distribution. However, all the above approaches assume that the server has ideal communication resources. The
limited communication of the cloud server will be a bottleneck for CFL with large number of devices involved. For DFL, previous research
mainly focuses on communication optimization, and there are relatively few studies on solving non-iid problems. Although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed some DFL methods for solving the non-iid problem, there is still a gap in
their performance compared to CFL methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address data heterogeneity and communication bottlenecks in CFL, we proposed an algorithm called FedSR, a semi-decentralized cloud-edge-device
hierarchical federated learning framework with a star-ring topology for IoT applications. In FedSR, firstly, each device will select a nearby edge
server to participate in the training. Then, the edge server will randomly connect the participating devices into a ring cluster and an incremental
subgradient optimization algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> is employed to address data heterogeneity. We experimentally demonstrate the
effectiveness of the ring incremental algorithm in federated learning with a small number of participating devices. Finally, the cloud server uses
the FedAvg algorithm to aggregate the resulting models from each edge server and update the global model. In this way, the cloud server only needs
to aggregate the resulting models from each edge server without aggregating the models of all devices in each round, thus alleviating the bottleneck
of communication at the cloud server. In addition, in each ring cluster, we adopt the DFL training method, which fully utilizes the communication
resources between devices without additional infrastructure costs. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In DFL, several studies have proposed federated learning based on fully connected topology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>,

single-point attacks of star architectures, it introduces a large amount of redundant communication consumption and makes it
difficult to ensure model convergence due to the lack of model aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In order to reduce communication
redundancy and accelerate model convergence, the researchers proposed a ring topology DFL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>,

Xu et al. combines the modified Ring All-reduce with
the modified Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to design a ring topology DFL to mitigate the uplink transmission time of FL in

the bandwidth utilization as well as the training stability. In RDFL, the clients in the ring topology will receive the previous
client’s model for training in each training round, and when the clients in the ring topology receive the models from all the clients
it will use the FedAvg algorithm for model aggregation. Lee et al. proposed a federated learning algorithm based on ring topology
called TornadoAggregate to improve the model accuracy as well as the scalability of federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
Lu Han et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. considers that dishonest clients can seriously compromise security and fairness in the training
of ring topology federated learning. To solve the problem, They propose a Ring-architecture-based Fair Federated Learning framework
and record the transactions of participating clients into a blockchain to prevent tampering. These above federated learning frameworks
based on ring topology are mainly considered for communication optimization, scalability, fairness and security.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To address the bottleneck of servers in traditional federated learning, several studies have proposed the hierarchical federated
learning framework. Liu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed a basic hierarchical federated learning framework, called HierFAVG, to
reduce the communication cost and speed up the convergence of the model. HierFedAVG allows edge servers to aggregate partial models
uploaded from clients and the cloud service periodically aggregates models from edge servers, which speeds up model convergence and
better balancing of communication computations. To achieve low-latency and energy-efficient federated learning, HFEL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>
decomposes the client-edge-cloud hierarchical federated learning into two subproblems: resource allocation and edge association. By
employing the optimal policy for the convex resource allocation subproblem among a group of devices connected to a single edge server,
HFEL can attain an effective edge association strategy through an iterative process that reduces global costs. To enable continuous
evolution of the distributed model with new data from devices, Zhong et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> proposed FLEE, a hierarchical federated
learning framework. FLEE consides various data distributions on devices and edges and allows for dynamic model updates without redeployment.
TiFL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> employs an adaptive tier selection approach to mitigate the impact of resource and data heterogeneity by observing
training efficiency and accuracy to divide clients to different tiers (e.g., fast, and slow tiers) in real time. However, TiFL’s strategy
of favoring faster tiers may lead to training bias and lower model accuracy. FedAT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> draws on the TiFL tier selection
approach, but different from TiFL, FedAT combines intra-tier synchronous training with inter-tier asynchronous training in order to
effectively avoid training biases.</p>

However, previous research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> has shown that when the data distribution across devices is non-iid, it will
degrade the performance of the global model. Because in the non-iid scenario, the models trained by each device will be biased towards
the local optimum, making the aggregated global model differ significantly from the true optimum. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed
an incremental subgradient optimization algorithm, which consider an optimization problems with a cost function consisting of a lager number

Motivated by the incremental subgradient optimization algorithm, we connect devices participating in federated learning
in a ring topology, where each device can communicate with neighboring devices. We treat the data of each device as a centralized learning’s ”batch data”.
And each device receives the model optimized by the previous device and uses own private data for training, as follows:

accuracy in most cases, which demonstrate ring-optimization can effectively address data heterogeneity. Since MNIST is easy to train, ring-optimization
and FedAvg achieve high test accuracy in the iid setting.

test accuracy in the early stages of training, however, the test accuracy in the later stages of training surpasses that of FedAvg. We consider that the
ring incremental optimization algorithm increases knowledge sharing among devices when performing model optimization. As the learning rate decays, devices
can learn the knowledge of other devices in a more detailed way, which enhances the generalization of the local model and avoids biasing the local optimal
solution.</p>

to the unacceptable training time required when dealing with a large number of devices and converges slowly. However, we can
get an insight from ring-optimization that devices in small-scale ring topology can improve the generalization of local models
by sharing local model and training it with small learning rates at later stage. Hence, we further propose a federated learning
framework for star-ring topology (FedSR), which can be applied to large-scale and non-iid scenarios. If we rewrite the loss function

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.10" class="ltx_p">In FedSR, only models are transferred between devices and each device’s private data is reserved locally. To protect the privacy
leakage problem between devices, we can also use techniques such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. In this paper,
we focus on the non-iid problem in federated learning, so we do not further discuss the privacy problem between devices. The specific
implementation of FedSR is shown in algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="In III-C Framework ‣ III Methodology ‣ FedSR: A Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning Algorithm for Non-IIDness in IoT System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.10" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, we utilize two types of neural networks: the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). The MLP
architecture comprises two hidden layers, each followed by a ReLU activation function, and a classification layer. The MLP model contains a total of

two fully connected layers, with 128420 parameters in total. Both iid and non-iid approaches are used for data classification. For the iid setting,
we divide the training set randomly and equally to all devices. For the non-iid setting, we will use both pathological and Dirichlet distributions
for the data partitioning. The pathological distribution is divided by sorting the labels according to the training set, and slicing these labels
into equal-sized shares, and then the device randomly selects <math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\xi" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ξ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜉</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\xi</annotation></semantics></math> shares from them.

number of epochs for ring optimization both increase the training accuracy of the model for the same computation burden. However, in non-iid
setting, increasing the number of epochs of loop optimization results in better model performance than increasing the number of epochs of local
updates. Increasing the number of rounds of ring optimization allows for more frequent information exchange among devices, thus preventing the
model from biasing towards local optima.

performance is worse compared to when they perform 1, 2, or 5 local update epochs. This is because increasing local update rounds can lead to
the model being biased towards local optima, thereby impacting the generalization ability of the global model.</p>

On
the CIFAR-10 dataset, we set the number of participating devices in federated learning to 50. Each device performed 1 local training round, and
the number of ring optimization was set to 5. We varied the proportion of devices in the ring cluster as a percentage of the total number of devices,
with values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4. The experimental results are depicted in Figure <a href="#S4.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ IV-F The impact of the number of ring clusters ‣ IV EXPERIMENTS ‣ FedSR: A Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning Algorithm for Non-IIDness in IoT System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. As the number of devices in the ring cluster
increases, we can observe an improvement in the performance of the global model. This is because the devices in each ring topology have access to
the knowledge of more devices. Although increasing the number of devices in the ring cluster can improve the performance of the model, it also brings
more training time. So FedSR need to make a trade-off between performance and training time.</p>

<p id="S4.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To show the scalability of FedSR, we experimented with a larger number of devices on the CIFAR-10. We set the number of devices to 100, the
participation rate of devices per round to 0.2 and 0.4, and the number of devices per ring cluster to 4 for FedSR, respectively. The other settings
are the same as in section <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-D Accuracy Comparison ‣ IV EXPERIMENTS ‣ FedSR: A Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning Algorithm for Non-IIDness in IoT System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. The experiment results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-H Scalability ‣ IV EXPERIMENTS ‣ FedSR: A Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning Algorithm for Non-IIDness in IoT System" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.

we can see that FedSR has a superior performance compared to the other centralized federated learning approaches in the case of large device participation.
Although ring-optimization can achieve higher accuracy than FedSR, it takes a lot of time, due to its serial training approach, and is not practical.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider federated learning in the Internet of Things (IoT) and propose a
semi-decentralized hierarchical federated learning framework. In order to reduce the impact of
data heterogeneity, we introduce the incremental subgradient optimization algorithm in the training
of ring cluster. And the semi-decentralized hierarchical federated learning framework can effectively
reduce the communication pressure on the cloud server by dividing the participating clients into
different ring clusters for training. Meanwhile, We conducted experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. The results of our experiments show that the method proposed in
this paper has higher model accuracy in non-iid setting and lower communication cost compared to
previous federated learning algorithms. In the future, we plan to take the system heterogeneity
problem into account to further optimize training efficiency.</p>
