<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Insufficient data is a long-standing challenge for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to build a high-performance deep learning model. Though numerous research groups and institutes collect a multitude of EEG datasets for the same BCI task, sharing EEG data from multiple sites is still challenging due to the heterogeneity of devices. The significance of this challenge cannot be overstated, given the critical role of data diversity in fostering model robustness. However, existing works rarely discuss this issue, predominantly centering their attention on model training within a single dataset, often in the context of inter-subject or inter-session settings.
In this work, we propose a hierarchical personalized Federated Learning EEG decoding (<span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span>) framework to surmount this challenge. This innovative framework heralds a new learning paradigm for BCI, enabling datasets with disparate data formats to collaborate in the model training process. Each client is assigned a specific dataset and trains a hierarchical personalized model to manage diverse data formats and facilitate information exchange. Meanwhile, the server coordinates the training procedure to harness knowledge gleaned from all datasets, thus elevating overall performance.
The framework has been evaluated in Motor Imagery (MI) classification with nine EEG datasets collected by different devices but implementing the same MI task.
Results demonstrate that the proposed frame can boost classification performance up to 16.7% by enabling knowledge sharing between multiple datasets, especially for smaller datasets.
Visualization results also indicate that the proposed framework can empower the local models to put a stable focus on task-related areas, yielding better performance.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end solution to address this important challenge.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a crucial technology that establishes a connection between the human brain and external devices, which has clinical and non-clinical applications in many areas, such as movement capability recovery and assistance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, cognitive health <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and entertainment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most commonly used signals in BCI to decode brain activities.
In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been employed in EEG decoding and classification tasks.
Since the success of deep learning algorithms is largely attributed to the availability of large amounts of data, collecting enough data is important for EEG decoding.
However, EEG data collection from humans can be challenging and costly.
The physiological limitations of subjects limit the number of samples collected from one person.
And the significant cost and complicated usage of the devices limit the number of participants in one dataset. Thus, most datasets are of middle size, collected from dozens of subjects with hundreds of samples per subject at most.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing works enhance EEG decoding model performance mainly by sharing knowledge between subjects or sessions within one single dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. However,
there are some datasets designed with the same task and protocol.
Drawing upon the widely acknowledged principle that larger training datasets tend to yield enhanced classification outcomes in deep learning approaches, it is anticipated that advancements in model performance could be realized through the amalgamation of knowledge from these datasets as a larger virtual training set.
Unfortunately, EEG data collected by various devices have heterogeneous formats, in terms of the number and location of EEG channels, sampling rates, and amplifiers.
This device heterogeneity problem prevents knowledge sharing among datasets.
Few works made initial attempts to solve this problem by dropping channels or padding with zeros, which may lose information or add noise to the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
This important issue remains unresolved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging collaborative machine learning paradigm to train models across multiple data owners and enables local models to benefit from each other while keeping local data private <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
FL has been applied in many medical and healthcare applications, such as disease prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and brain template estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, to facilitate cross-silo cooperation with privacy protection.
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is a branch of FL dealing with the heterogeneity issue across clients, including the heterogeneity in data distributions, network structures, and data formats. It inspires us to design the proposed framework to solve the device heterogeneity issue in the EEG decoding application.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we provide a new solution to enlarge the training set by including more related datasets. We design a hierarchical personalized <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">F</span>ederated <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">L</span>earning <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">EEG</span> decoding (<span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span>) framework to solve the device heterogeneity issue.
The framework makes use of the PFL architecture to facilitate cooperative training among multiple device-heterogeneous EEG datasets.
It consists of a server and several clients. The server orchestrates local models’ training in clients to obtain the optimal personalized models for each dataset assigned to the clients.
The personalized model compromises a local module followed by a global one.
The local module is responsible for extracting features with the same formats from device-heterogeneous datasets, while the global module transfers the knowledge between datasets to improve model performance.
We evaluated the proposed framework with nine real Motor Imagery (MI) EEG datasets collected by multiple institutes.
It improves the model performances on most datasets compared to independent training, especially for smaller datasets with an improvement of up to 16.7%.
This framework provides a new general learning paradigm for the BCI community to train higher-performance models with multiple datasets, instead of one.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The issue of device-heterogeneity in EEG applications has received limited attention in existing studies. Most of the research has primarily focused on transferring knowledge across subjects or sessions within one dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Only a few works have made attempts to address the heterogeneity across datasets in EEG applications. Some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> make the data formats consistent by either deleting channels or padding with zeros. However, these methods can introduce disturbances into the EEG signal, either by losing valuable information or adding noise.
Other researchers have explored the channel mapping methods as a separate feature extractor during pre-processing on heterogeneous datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, since this feature extractor is not integrated into the end-to-end training process, it lacks the flexibility to adapt to each dataset and may introduce noise into the analysis.</p>

In FL, data owners with local data can be referred to as <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clients</span> if they are coordinated by a central entity referred to as the <span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">server</span>.</p>

According to the heterogeneity types, existing in data distribution, data format, local model structure, computation ability and etc, various solutions have been proposed.
For the data format heterogeneity issue, some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> design local encoders to project the data to a common space first and then transfer knowledge between clients based on the aligned features.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning algorithms have been applied to some BCI applications recently.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> applies Federated Learning to EEG decoding with the cross-subject task. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> borrow the manifold learning methods in transfer learning and apply them in the federated setting on the cross-subject and cross-session tasks.
These works only focus on the data distribution heterogeneity issue limited to one dataset.
Besides, privacy protection between subjects in one dataset is not a critical issue. EEG data is not as intuitive as images. People can understand the information in the image when they see it, but EEG information needs a professional device to collect and methods to decode.
Thus, the ability to interpret and protect EEG data privacy is limited exclusively to research institutes rather than individuals.
Thus, EEG data privacy protection for research institutes is more practical than the individuals.</p>

Following the classical FL framework, the proposed framework consists of one central server and several clients, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.2 Overall framework ‣ 3 PROPOSED METHODS ‣ Aggregating Intrinsic Information to Enhance BCI Performance through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Each client is assigned one dataset and processes the dataset with its local personalized model for the classification task.
The server manages the cooperation between clients.
Note that the ”<span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">personalized model</span>” in this work indicates the specific network structures designed for the assigned datasets, instead of models trained for different subjects.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The personalized model in the client consists of a local module and a global module.
The local module acts as a feature encoder to extract the embedding features from EEG data and map them into a unified format across clients.
The global module is designed to transfer knowledge between clients by communicating the model weights of global modules in all clients via the FL aggregation in the server.
The proposed framework makes each client train its personalized model not only using its own data but also employing knowledge transferred from other datasets, which tremendously enlarges its training set to get better performance.
Next, we introduce the detailed designs of the proposed framework.

Inspired by the DeepConvNets (DCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, we design the local module with a convolution-based temporal filter and a convolution-based spatial filter followed by two standard convolution-max-pooling layers to extract spatial-temporal information from EEG data, refer to the ”<span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Local Module</span>” part in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.3 Personalized model in the clients ‣ 3 PROPOSED METHODS ‣ Aggregating Intrinsic Information to Enhance BCI Performance through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
To match the dataset formats, the network structure design of the local module is personalized to its dataset.
By setting a suitable kernel size based on the format of input data, the extracted features from heterogeneous datasets can be unified.

According to this assumption, we select nine public EEG datasets for this study:
the Korea University (KU) MI dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the Shanghai University (SHU) MI dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the Shin2017A dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the BCI-IV-2a dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the Weibo2014 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the MunichMI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, the High-Gamma Dataset (HGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the Cho2017 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, and the Murat2018 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> dataset.
These datasets all focus on the hands’ motor imagery task to classify subjects’ imagery movements of their hands. All of them contain the left-hand and right-hand motor imagery classes.
The statistical information of these datasets is presented in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1.1 Datasets ‣ 4.1 Experiment Settings ‣ 4 Evaluations ‣ Aggregating Intrinsic Information to Enhance BCI Performance through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> with the number of subjects, the number of trials per subject, the total amount of trials, the number of channels, and sampling frequencies.
It should be noted that some datasets have more than two classes (e.g. the BCI-IV-2a dataset has four categories including left hand, right hand, feet, and tongue), but this work only uses data related to the left and right hand.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We adopt a subject-independent setting for the cross-dataset training task and utilize the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) strategy for evaluation. LOSO leaves one subject as the test set. The rest subjects are partitioned into a training set and a validation set to train one model. Once the model is well-trained, it is tested on the left subject to obtain classification accuracy. The overall performance is determined by averaging these accuracy values across all subjects.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since our evaluation involves nine datasets comprising a total of 214 subjects, strictly following the LOSO approach would be extremely time-consuming. Consequently, we propose an approximate version of the LOSO evaluation strategy for the federated learning framework to enhance training efficiency. Each dataset applies the LOSO methodology independently but simultaneously, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.2 Overall framework ‣ 3 PROPOSED METHODS ‣ Aggregating Intrinsic Information to Enhance BCI Performance through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Compared to the strict LOSO approach, the modified version leaves out the data of nine subjects - one from each dataset - as nine test sets for nine datasets correspondingly. However, due to variations in the number of subjects across datasets, subjects from datasets with fewer individuals will undergo the LOSO multiple times. This repetition is aimed at facilitating the training for datasets with more subjects. Ultimately, the final classification results for these repeated subjects are obtained by averaging the values.</p>

One possible reason for the similar performance is that the number of trials of these datasets is large enough.
Besides, for KU, Murat2018, and HGD datasets, the similar performances may also be due to their high baseline performance, which already exceed 80%. Thus, they can not benefit significantly from other lower-quality datasets.
As for the SHU dataset, it may be attributed to the significant disparity between the data distribution of the SHU dataset and the others, as evidenced by its lowest baseline performance among the nine datasets, indicating a large disparity.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.2.2 Sensitivity analysis ‣ 4.2 Experiment Results ‣ 4 Evaluations ‣ Aggregating Intrinsic Information to Enhance BCI Performance through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, bubbles located on the left side of the x-axis are blue while bubbles located on the right side are red. It indicates that datasets with fewer trials per subject can benefit more from the proposed framework. For instance, the Shin2017A dataset, with 60 trials collected for each subject, shows a 16.7% improvement with <span id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span>. Meanwhile, the Murat2018 dataset, with more than 1500 trials per subject, rarely gains any improvement from the system.
Similarly, for a fixed value on the x-axis, the bubbles at the bottom of the y-axis are larger than the ones at the top. This suggests that datasets with fewer subjects can benefit more from the proposed framework, given a similar number of trials per subject. For example, the Weibo2014 and Cho2017 datasets have around 150-200 trials per subject. But the improvement on the Weibo2014 dataset, with 10 subjects, reaches 12.29%, compared to only 0.98% on the Cho2017 dataset, which has 52 subjects.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing these two factors, the number of trials per subject is more important. Even if a dataset involves many subjects, <span id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span> can still improve the performance if the number of trials collected from one subject is small, such as Shin2017A dataset. Therefore, the number of trials per subject is the primary factor, while the number of subjects is a secondary factor in determining the <span id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span> performance.
Thus, the proposed framework can be applied to small datasets to train high-performance models. Additionally, with the help of the <span id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span> framework, the model can achieve good results trained with a small number of trials collected from one subject.</p>

Although the improvements are relatively lower for the bottom 5 subjects shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.2.3 Interpretability and visualization ‣ 4.2 Experiment Results ‣ 4 Evaluations ‣ Aggregating Intrinsic Information to Enhance BCI Performance through Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, <span id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span> stably learns from motor cortex regions ( CCP5h and CCP3h ) compared to the baseline method that focuses on non-motor areas for some subjects, i.e., subject 20 and subject 3.
As the number of samples increases, both <span id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span> and the baseline method concentrate more on EEG from the motor-related areas.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed a new learning paradigm for BCI to train the high-performance EEG decoding model with multiple datasets. We designed a hierarchical personalized federated-learning-based framework <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span> to solve the device-heterogeneity issue among multiple EEG datasets, enabling knowledge sharing between datasets.
The proposed framework has been evaluated with nine real MI datasets and obtained promising results with reasonable interpretations.
This framework overcomes the challenge of insufficient data for model training in BCI. Thus, small datasets can train better models by making use of the knowledge from other datasets with the help of <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FLEEG</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, it is interesting to apply the proposed framework to more complex situations where the datasets have various protocols and tasks or improve the local module with more powerful feature encoders.</p>
