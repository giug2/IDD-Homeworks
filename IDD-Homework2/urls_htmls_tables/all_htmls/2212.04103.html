<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">State-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, notably deep learning, are data-devouring. In the traditional ML, a centralized algorithm works on big centralized data that have been gathered, transmitted, and stored before. While recently, data tend to be distributed at the network’s edge considering emerging technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and new network generations like 5G. Despite generating hundreds of Zettabytes of data mainly produced by edge devices, only a tiny part of them is being stored. On top of that, both reports and forecasts illustrate the share of data centers from the stored data is less than 20% <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Obviously, there is much data, but not where it used to be. So, ML has come across a new generation of data owners with specific characteristics and requirements. As a prime example, usually, there is no willingness to expose or share local data among them due to privacy issues, escaping from data transmission overhead, or legislative reasons. Therefore, modern ML algorithms have no choice but to be fed on many distributed localized small data instead of centralized stored big data.
<br class="ltx_break">To this end, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Federated Learning (FL)</span> has been proposed as an ML paradigm wanting to reach a trained global model on a server by training several models over remote devices like smartphones or siloed data centers such as hospitals while keeping the clients’ data localized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Generally, there are two scenarios in this context from the scalability perspective: cross-device and cross-silo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Both scenarios utilize a central server or service to orchestrate the training process based on their participants’ local data. However, they are different from each other in several fundamental views, such as communications, data availability, client reliability, and so forth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break">In addition to the commonplace challenges in the traditional ML, there are some new stumbling blocks to reaching good performance in FL. These obstacles mostly come from FL’s distributed nature. Heterogeneity is one of the most important things that affect FL performance. The clients can be heterogeneous regarding their resources and, more importantly, their data. The authors paid attention to the impact of resource heterogeneity such as CPU, memory, or network and the data size on training time in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Data heterogeneity is an inescapable fact in FL notably in the cross-device scenarios. Aggregation of clients’ models, while they own non-iid (independent and identically distributed) data, is likely to reach a non-optimal global model at the server. So, considering this issue is critical for all proposed FL algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break">The communication cost of uploading and downloading the models is another crucial challenge in FL. Generally, we can address this issue by decreasing the size of transmitted models’ parameters or reducing the communication rounds. The number of global rounds and local epochs are two important hyperparameters that control the trade-off between the model’s accuracy and training efficiency in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
<br class="ltx_break">Another issue is the impact of FL on the environment. Many studies show how much ML algorithms are responsible for producing <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ch</span>CO_2-equivalents (<span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ch</span>CO_2e). As an illustration, training a large transformer model with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) may produce <span id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ch</span>CO_2e, almost 56 times more than the average amount a person is responsible for in a year <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Another research investigated this issue in FL and showed that it is more significant than we used to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. The authors formulated the FL energy consumption and quantified <span id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ch</span>CO_2e emissions compared to the centralized ML scenario. Needless to say that the number of global rounds is the most significant parameter affecting the issue. Although the earlier studies had investigated the impact of non-iid data on the required global rounds to achieve the threshold accuracy, they conducted the same experiments to provide more intuition. The results showed that conventional FL algorithms may need to run global rounds of more than 5000 to reach 50% accuracy for non-iid partitioned <span id="S1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">CIFAR10</span> data; nearly 4.5 times more than the iid setup. It is tantamount to consuming energy five times and emitting almost 380 times <span id="S1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ch</span>CO_2e more than centralized ML.</p>

<p id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Carrying the above insight, <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> proposes an add-on for adjusting adaptive weights usable for almost all averaging-based aggregation in FL. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ GTFLAT: Game Theory Based Add-On For Empowering Federated Learning Aggregation Techniques" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> depicts the <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span>’s overview. In line with the realistic view, the main goal is to reach better accuracy during fewer communication rounds considering non-iid data and fewer active users in each round. Fewer communication rounds and participants, less energy consumption, and fewer <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\ch</span>CO2e emission. Although in the mentioned setting, <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> equips the state-of-the-art FL algorithms so that they stand head and shoulders above what they used to be, it doesn’t degrade their performance in other alternate scenarios.
<br class="ltx_break">Therefore it is possible to summarize our contribution as follows: <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(I)</span> We propose a new formulation for the FL aggregation procedure as a strategic game in which the active users play each other to reach an equilibrium as a self-enforcement agreement on the adaptive weights for averaging. <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(II)</span> We put forward an estimation based on the distance between each pair of received updates as the game’s utility function to avoid imposing extra overhead and new information requirements. <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(III)</span> To provide a systematic solution for the proposed game, we devise a mechanism based on population game and evolutionary game principles. The final state of the populations indicates the equilibrium of the game and the averaging weights consequently. <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(IV)</span> We capsulate the proposed solution as an add-on that gets the received updates as an input and gives the adaptive weights as the output. So, it is possible to use it as a new abstract module in all FL techniques using averaging for the aggregation. <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(V)</span> We show <span id="S1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> improves performance and training efficiency by reaching more accurate models during fewer global FL rounds in heterogeneous scenarios. However, it has no negative impact on the performance in alternate scenarios. We propose a new evaluation parameter called Effective Round Improvement Ratio for more intuition of this claim.</p>

<p id="S2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the aggregation of clients’ models, <span id="S2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FEDAVG</span> employs an element-wise averaging aggregation scheme over client model weights.
However, if the client’s data is sampled non-iid from their aggregated data, which typically occurs in practice, its performance can suffer due to a drift in the client updates. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
To address this issue, many improvements have been proposed to FEDAVG.
From a local training perspective, a few strategies have been put forth to address the heterogeneity issue.
<span id="S2.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">SCAFFOLD</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> tries to correct drift in the client’s updates by estimating the difference between the server model’s and client models’ update direction.
<span id="S2.p9.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FEDPROX</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> makes local training more consistent by including a proxy term in the cost function to prevent model drifts in clients.

<span id="S2.p9.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FEDGEN</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> utilizes a data-free knowledge distillation approach to learn a generative model and broadcast it to the clients to escort their model training.
Another aim is to improve the efficiency of model aggregation by using adaptive weighting and Bayesian approaches.
<span id="S2.p9.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">IDA</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposed a novel aggregation method that determines the coefficient weights in model aggregation based on the statistical meta-information from model parameters.

However, it is not suitable for deep models.
<span id="S2.p9.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FedDF</span> uses knowledge distillation in the server and enhances the global model with the ensemble knowledge from local models.
<span id="S2.p9.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">FEDBE</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> uses a bayesian approach to sample better base models and integrates ensemble learning for much more powerful aggregation.
<span id="S2.p9.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> as a game theory-based add-on helps all FL algorithms that use averaging as the aggregation to reach better accuracy during fewer communication rounds in heterogeneous scenarios. Besides, it guarantees not to affect homogeneous ones negatively. So, the outcome of using <span id="S2.p9.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> leads to Pareto improvement and dominates not using it.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.12" class="ltx_p">After modeling and representation, we must solve the game. The game solution seeks to intelligently prognosis the game to recommend rational strategies to players. In other words, a solution must define the best response of each player to the selected strategies by the others. Therefore, finding a strategy profile in which all players has no profitable motivation to deviate is a solution for a game. This is one of the most common approaches to solve a game. A strategy profile that all its elements are the best response is a Nash Equilibrium (NE). We call a strategy pure or mixed, depending on it contains only one action or a combination of actions. A mixed strategy is a probability distribution over actions.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">John Nash proved the existence of at least one mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in every finite strategic form game. A finite game refers to a game with a finite number of players who have finite actions and definitive payments. This is brilliant but not constructive proof. Therefore, finding Nash equilibrium may be like finding the needle in the haystack. Generally, this problem is classified as a PPAD (Polynomial Parity Arguments on Directed graphs) complexity class member that is a subset of NP class <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, due to inadequate resources, the intelligence principle may not be satisfied in some situations. Due to incomplete computation of the optimal strategy, even fully rational and intelligent players may make a myopic decision based on their rule-of-thumb behavior. This inevitable fact is called bounded rationality in game theory<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Despite these limitations, if there is an equilibrium in a game and players play the game repeatedly with learning about previous actions, they will modify their strategies and finally reach an equilibrium <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. In other words, players’ strategies can converge to equilibrium by a flexible rule-of-thumb and adaptive behavior. This idea implements via two approaches, <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">evolutionary game theory</span> and <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">learning in the game</span>.
<br class="ltx_break">Darwin’s classic founded the theory of evolution, and John Maynard Smith introduced the evolutionary game theory in the 1980s in his book <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> after his seminal research in the 1970s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. The main idea of the evolutionary game lies in a simple natural rule. Every organism selects its strategy inherently based on its inner nature, and a better-fitted strategy leads to more living opportunities and more offspring. Therefore, nature reinforces better strategies, and after a while, organisms select the best responses, and the population converges to an equilibrium. Only one important point of this simple cycle remains: although children inherently follow their parent’s strategy, there is always the possibility of a change in strategy due to the mutation. Therefore, population games and using evolutionary dynamics propose another solution for a game that can overcome the mentioned limitations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. In such games, players’ masses consider as a population with initialized selected strategies. The set of chosen strategies by population is called the state of the game. The initial state can equal a pure or a mixed strategy, and it does not rely on rationality and intelligence. A revision protocol based on a fitness function determines the population’s life expectancy, reproduction, and mutation.
<br class="ltx_break">There are some specialized terms and definitions in the evolutionary game theory. Using dynamics is a prevalent approach to solving a population game. Regarding dynamics, we can use the replicator equation as defined in Definition <a href="#Thmdefinition2" title="Definition 2 ‣ 3.1 Population games and evolutionary dynamics ‣ 3 Game theory background ‣ GTFLAT: Game Theory Based Add-On For Empowering Federated Learning Aggregation Techniques" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

The global model must satisfy all clients while being accurate enough in the face of unseen data. From the personalization point of view, clients logically tend to the local model trained on their own local data. However, no client can prejudge what happens when it comes across unseen data. Thereby, the server should find an equilibrium profile among clients in which no one motivates to deviate from it. This fact is sufficient to remind us of game theory usage. Hence, we first formulate the mentioned problem as a game and propose a systematic solution based on the principles of evolutionary game theory.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.10" class="ltx_p">Perhaps like most game theory-based modelings, defining the utility function is the main stumbling block as the most complex part. It is clear that the more accurate model, the greater its utility. Every player must update and evaluate the model based on each possible strategy profile in a brute force routine. It means imposing a huge communication and computation extra overhead. Adding such a burden is tantamount to the last straw for an intrinsically herculean task such as FL and is not affordable. Hence, the main question is: how does each player can judge the model before updating it? A good Estimation.

The server sets up a population game corresponding to the proposed strategic game to provide a systematic solution. It considers there are some populations based on the defined players. Although the available actions for each person are the same as the proposed strategic game, the members of the initial generation choose their strategies inherently and randomly. Then, by considering the obtained outcome and applying a revision protocol, they overhaul their strategies to be more fit than they used to. The server repeats this process for several generations to end up in an asymptotically stable state. Eventually, the server calculates the adaptive weights based on the game’s final state.

In the main setup, we assume there are 50 clients so that 10% of them participate in each FL round as active users. Random uniform distribution is the employed client selection strategy. The server iterates FL training for 200 rounds. Besides, every active user trains the received model for 20 epochs in each round. To simulate the proposed game, each player starts the game with equal portions of the population for each available strategy. They update their strategies based on Replicator dynamics for 50 generations to reach the final state.

<p id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.9" class="ltx_p">To make a long story short, results reveal that in the best cases, using <span id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2.9.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> increases top-1 accuracy by about 4% and decreases required communication rounds by more than 52%; this is while it has just about 0.61% and 6.72% negative impacts on the mentioned criteria in the worst cases. On average, it helps the mentioned FL algorithms reach 1.38% more top-1 test accuracy in 21.06% fewer communication rounds than they used to.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a game theory-based add-on called <span id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> to find adaptive weights for averaging in the aggregation phase of FL algorithms. As a vividly plus, all FL algorithms that use averaging for model aggregation can be benefited from the proposed new module. <span id="S6.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> modeled averaging task as a strategic game among active users in each round of FL. Then, it provided a systematic solution to find the game’s equilibrium based on a population game and evolutionary dynamics. In contrast with other approaches in which the server imposes the weights on the clients, <span id="S6.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> concludes a self-enforcement agreement among clients by the obtained equilibrium. From the theoretical point of view, <span id="S6.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> expects to reach better performance because there is no individual motivation to deviate from an equilibrium strategy profile. Despite this, we conducted comprehensive tests on famous datasets and prevalent FL algorithms to practically examine <span id="S6.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> performance. However, we had to show one piece of a larger picture in this paper. Additionally, we proposed a new evaluation parameter called effective round improvement ratio to analyze the results more intuitively. The obtained results proved that using <span id="S6.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> alongside state-of-the-art FL algorithms is a plus for both model performance and training efficiency, notably in heterogeneous scenarios.
<br class="ltx_break">Finally, considering the model aggregation as a cooperative game and applying a similar idea with <span id="S6.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">GTFLAT</span> to design a mechanism to improve the client selection strategy are our future directions in line with this research.</p>
