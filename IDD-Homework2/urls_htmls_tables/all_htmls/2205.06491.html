<p id="id1.1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning (FL), it is commonly assumed that all data are placed at clients in the beginning of machine learning (ML) optimization (i.e., offline learning). However, in many real-world applications, it is expected to proceed in an online fashion. To this end, online FL (OFL) has been introduced, which aims at learning a sequence of global models from decentralized streaming data such that the so-called cumulative regret is minimized. Combining online gradient descent and model averaging, in this framework, FedOGD is constructed as the counterpart of FedSGD in FL. While it can enjoy an optimal sublinear regret, FedOGD suffers from heavy communication costs. In this paper, we present a communication-efficient method (named OFedIQ) by means of intermittent transmission (enabled by client subsampling and periodic transmission) and quantization. For the first time, we derive the regret bound that captures the impact of data-heterogeneity and the communication-efficient techniques. Through this, we efficiently optimize the parameters of OFedIQ such as sampling rate, transmission period, and quantization levels. Also, it is proved that the optimized OFedIQ can asymptotically achieve the performance of FedOGD while reducing the communication costs by <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="99\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">99</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">99</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">99\%</annotation></semantics></math>.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging framework for distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning (ML), in which a central server coordinates ML optimization with a massive number of clients without directly sharing training data stored in the decentralized clients (i.e., local data) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In FL, the clients train local models separately from local data and the central server constructs a global model only using the aggregated local models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Specifically, a global model is learned by performing the two steps iteratively: i) local model optimizations (usually via stochastic gradient descent (SGD)) at each client; ii) global model optimization (e.g., model averaging) at the central server. There are myriads of applications such as ML from wearable devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, location-based services <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and human activity recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, numerous FL methods have been proposed.
FedSGD was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, where a global model is optimized via local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) at clients and model averaging at a central server. Also, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the convergence analysis of FedSGD was provided for both cases of identical and heterogeneous data. Incorporating client subsampling (or partial participation) and periodic averaging into FedSGD, the de facto optimization method (named FedAvg) was presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which has lower communication costs than FedSGD. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, a communication-efficient FL method (named FedPAQ) was proposed by integrating a stochastic quantization into FedAvg. To sophisticate a quantization method, vector quantizations suitable for FL were proposed in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Also, an enhanced gradient-quantization technique, called Lazily Aggregated Quantized (LAQ) gradient, was presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Interestingly, it was shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> that FedAvg suffers from the
so-called ‘client-drift’ when the degree of data heterogeneity is high (i.e., non-IID data), resulting in unstable and slower convergence. This problem becomes more serious as the fraction of participating clients becomes smaller. Many works have put much effort into addressing the above problem. SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and Variance Reduced Local-SGD (VRL-SGD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> employed extra control variates to accelerate the convergence by reducing the variance of stochastic gradients. FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> added a proximal term to each local optimizations in order to suppress the discrepancy among the local models. FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> normalized the magnitude of local updates across the clients in the network so that the model averaging less distracts the global loss.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In most of the existing FL works, it is commonly assumed that features (or data) do not possess an associated inherent ordering (i.e., non-streaming data) and accordingly, all data samples are placed at clients in the beginning of ML optimization (i.e., offline learning). Existing FL methods, thus, have paid little attention to ML optimization from continuous streaming (or time-series) data. In many real-world applications, however, ML tasks are expected to be performed in an <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">online</span> fashion, wherein data samples are generated as a function of time and clients have to predict a label (or make a decision) upon receiving an incoming data. To handle such tasks, <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">online</span> FL (OFL) has been introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> by combining online learning (OL) (or streaming learning) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and FL. The goal of OFL is to seek a sequence of global models (or functions) in real time from continuous streaming data arriving at decentralized clients
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. At each time step, an up-to-date function is used to predict the label of newly incoming (previously unseen) data. The major difference between OFL methods and the aforementioned FL methods(e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, FedPAQ<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and FedNova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>) is in the objective of local updates. While FL methods aim at seeking a <span id="S1.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sole</span> global model that minimizes a global loss function, OFL methods aim at seeking a sequence of global models that minimizes the so-called cumulative regret (see Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Online Federated Learning (OFL) ‣ Tighter Regret Analysis and Optimization of Online Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) for details). Because of such difference, the existing FL methods may not ensure an optimal sublinear regret (i.e., an asymptotic optimality) for OFL. This opens up the necessity of new researches for OFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Very recently in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, an OFL method based on random feature-based multiple kernels (named eM-KOFL) was presented and its asymptotic optimality was proved via martingale argument. This work was mainly focused on dealing with multiple kernels in a communication-efficient way. Especially when a single-kernel is considered, vanilla method (named FedOGD) was constructed and analyzed, which can be immediately applied to deep neural network (DNN)-based methods. Note that FedOGD can be regarded as the counterpart of FedSGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> in FL. While it can enjoy an optimal sublinear regret, FedOGD suffers from heavy communication costs. A communication-efficient OFL method (named PSO-Fed) was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, where clients and a central server exchange a fraction of their model parameters: however, no regret analysis was conducted. These two methods employed online gradient descent (OGD) (which is commonly used for OL) as the underlying online optimization method to the clients. Leveraging online mirror descent (OMD) and periodic averaging, FedOMD was presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Note that when a widely-used Euclidean distance is adopted as Bregman divergence, OMD is reduced to OGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. It was proved that FedOMD can enjoy an optimal subliner regret. To the best of our knowledge, there is no additional OFL method with an analytical performance guarantee.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We emphasize that compared with FL, OFL researches are at an infancy level. In particular, the existing regret analyses have not considered the impact of the fundamental communication-efficient techniques (e.g., client subsampling, periodic transmission, and quantization), and data-heterogeneity over time and across clients. This is the motivation of our work since such analysis would be the stepping stone for the research of OFL.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, OFL is investigated in terms of constructing a communication-efficient method and tighter regret analysis. We improve the communication-efficiency of the baseline method (FedOGD) via two fundamental techniques such as intermittent transmission of model updates and quantization of updated gradients (see Fig. 1). The former directly reduces the number of transmissions (or active communication channels) and the latter diminishes the number of transmitted bits per each active channel. The proposed method is referred to as <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">O</span>nline <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fed</span>erated learning method with <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">I</span>ntermittent transmission and <span id="S1.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Q</span>uantization (OFedIQ). Herein, intermittent transmission is enabled by client subsampling (a.k.a. partial client participation) and periodic transmission (a.k.a. periodic averaging), which stand for the infrequent transmissions across clients and over time steps, respectively. Our major contributions are summarized as follows.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For practical non-asymptotic cases, it is required to optimize the key parameters of OFedIQ such as sampling rate, transmission period, and quantization levels. Leveraging our regret bound, we efficiently tackle such optimization problem, yielding almost closed-form solutions (see Algorithm 3). Given target communication costs, the proposed Algorithm 3 provides the optimal parameters of OFedIQ with respect to maximizing the asymptotic learning accuracy.</p>

Recall that in (conventional) FL, ML optimization is tackled under the assumption that each client has access to local data samples offline and such samples are generated statistically. Whereas, OFL is basically formed by combining online learning (OL) and FL. Compared to FL, thus, OFL has the following two major differences:</p>

To be specific, the local steps of FL methods aim at optimizing an objective function such as the expected global loss over local data distributions, whereas those of OFL methods aim at minimizing the cumulative regret in (<a href="#S2.E3" title="In 2.2 Online Optimization ‣ 2 Online Federated Learning (OFL) ‣ Tighter Regret Analysis and Optimization of Online Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).

Among them, the key features can be summarized as follows: (i) client subsampling (a.k.a. partial client participation); ii) periodic transmission (a.k.a. periodic averaging); (iii) quantization. Note that (i) and (ii) enable intermittent transmission, thereby directly reducing the number of transmissions, and (iii) decreases the number of transmitted bits per communication-channel. We first describe the three key features in the context of OFL (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 Vanilla Method: FedOGD ‣ 3 Methods ‣ Tighter Regret Analysis and Optimization of Online Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

At every time step, thus, it is impractical to have all clients participating in OFL protocol due to the extremely heavy communication costs.

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Although the asymptotic optimality of OFedIQ is proved, it does not ensure the best performances of OFedIQ for real-world OFL tasks. Thus, on the basis of our regret analysis in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Main Results ‣ 4 Regret Analysis ‣ Tighter Regret Analysis and Optimization of Online Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>, we further optimize the parameters of OFedIQ in Algorithm 2 such as sampling rate, transmission period, and quantization parameters. First we introduce a stochastic quantizer that will be used for our experiments in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Experiments ‣ Tighter Regret Analysis and Optimization of Online Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. This is an extension of the widely-used stochastic quantizer in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> by introducing the new parameter <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="b" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">b</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">b</annotation></semantics></math> (see Definition <a href="#Thmdefinition2" title="Definition 2 ‣ 4.2 Optimization of OFedIQ ‣ 4 Regret Analysis ‣ Tighter Regret Analysis and Optimization of Online Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> for details), where the proposed quantizer with <math id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="b=1" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">b</mi><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑏</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">1</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">b=1</annotation></semantics></math> is reduced to the existing one in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented a communication-efficient method (named OFedIQ) for online federated learning (OFL) by means of client subsampling, periodic transmission, and quantization. Through our tighter regret analysis,
it was proved that OFedIQ can enjoy an optimal sublinear regret for any real dataset (up to a constant) while significantly reducing the communication costs of FedOGD (i.e., the performance-limit). On the basis of our analysis, moreover, we efficiently optimized the key parameters of OFedIQ such as the sampling rate, the transmission period, and quantization levels. Via experiments with real datasets, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithm on various online classification and regression tasks. Specifically, for all datasets in our experiments, the optimized OFedIQ outperforms the state-of-the-art OFL methods. In addition, it can almost achieve the performances of FedOGD while reducing the communication costs by <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="99\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">99</mn><mo id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">99</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">99\%</annotation></semantics></math>.
