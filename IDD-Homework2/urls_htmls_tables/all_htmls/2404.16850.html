<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated Contrastive Learning (FCL) represents a burgeoning approach for learning from decentralized unlabeled data while upholding data privacy. In FCL, participant clients collaborate in learning a global encoder using unlabeled data, which can serve as a versatile feature extractor for diverse downstream tasks. Nonetheless, FCL is susceptible to privacy risks, such as membership information leakage, stemming from its distributed nature, an aspect often overlooked in current solutions. This study delves into the feasibility of executing a membership inference attack on FCL and proposes a robust attack methodology. The attacker’s objective is to determine if the data signifies training member data by accessing the model’s inference output. Specifically, we concentrate on attackers situated within a client framework, lacking the capability to manipulate server-side aggregation methods or discern the training status of other clients. We introduce two membership inference attacks tailored for FCL: the <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">passive membership inference attack</span> and the <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">active membership inference attack</span>, contingent on the attacker’s involvement in local model training.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent times, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent field in the domain of decentralized data learning while upholding data privacy standards  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In FL, individual client participants retrieve a global model from a centralized server and generate their own local models using their private data. These local models are then aggregated by the central server in an iterative manner to update the global model until convergence is achieved. By focusing on sharing model parameters instead of raw data, FL provides enhanced data privacy protection, making it a widely adopted approach in various sectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, FL operates under the assumption that each client possesses an ample amount of labeled data, which is often impractical. In reality, the availability of labeled data is significantly lower than that of unlabeled data, and annotating all unlabeled data is a time-consuming task, often rendering it infeasible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fortunately, the introduction of Federated Contrastive Learning (FCL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> has provided a solution to this challenge. In FCL, each decentralized client engages in collaborative learning to develop an encoder based on its local unlabeled data. This learned encoder can then serve as a feature extractor for constructing models for various downstream tasks using a limited amount of labeled data. As an innovative approach, FCL maximizes the utilization of distributed unlabeled data while safeguarding data privacy. Recent research efforts in the field of FCL have primarily concentrated on enhancing performance and scalability on non-IID data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, several scholars have expanded the scope of FCL applications. For instance, Dong et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> explored the extraction of representations from medical images under FCL settings, achieving notable results. Similarly, Saeed et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> investigated the extraction of representations from unlabeled sensor data within IoT domains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, in FCL, little attention has been devoted to potential privacy risks, such as membership information leakage. Within the domain of artificial intelligence security, it is widely recognized that FL is susceptible to various security threats, including membership inference attacks, as extensively studied by numerous researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. When considering membership inference attacks against FCL in comparison to FL, two key distinctions emerge. Firstly, FL’s model training typically relies on labeled data, enabling attackers to utilize this label information for membership inference attacks. In contrast, FCL participants engage in unsupervised learning of an encoder without access to labeled local data, thereby making membership inference attacks notably more challenging. Secondly, the distributed nature and learning objectives of FCL diverge from those of FL. While FL aims to train a model for a specific task, FCL strives to develop a general encoder suitable for multiple downstream tasks. Given the potential variation in data distribution across these tasks, devising strategies for membership inference attacks based on data distribution becomes less viable.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigates the feasibility of executing a membership inference attack against FCL and introduces a viable strategy for launching such attacks. Given the decentralized nature of federated contrastive learning, a potential attacker may operate from a client-side perspective. Consequently, all actions of the attacker are confined to the local client, precluding the ability to manipulate the server-side aggregation process or gain insights into the training status of other clients. <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The attacker’s objective is to determine whether the data represents training member information by accessing the model’s inference output.</span> We propose two methods for conducting membership inference attacks: <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">passive and active approaches</span>. Passive attackers abstain from participating in training or causing disruptions; instead, they solely acquire the model parameters post-training and then initiate membership inference attacks. In contrast, active attackers engage in gradient ascent on their local model, apply gradient ascent on the data to be inferred, transmit it to the server alongside other aggregated model parameters, and subsequently compute the loss for the data subjected to gradient ascent.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In particular, we delved into the <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">passive membership inference attack</span> method at three distinct levels: the cosine similarity-based attack, the internal model-based attack, and the feature combination-based attack. Initially, membership inference is deduced through cosine similarity values. Subsequently, we extract the internal encoders of the contrastive learning model (typically a deep neural network like ResNet) and subject them to conventional membership inference attacks, unveiling the inherent internal privacy vulnerabilities of the contrastive learning model. Finally, we concatenate the highest confidence value in cosine similarity, data loss, and model encoder prediction into a three-dimensional array, followed by training a linear classifier for membership/non-membership prediction. In the <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">active membership inference attack</span>, we implement gradient ascent on the overfitted model and observe that the data loss speed post-gradient ascent is slower for member data, thereby accomplishing member/non-member differentiation. These varied membership inference attack methods offer diverse insights into assessing the privacy risks associated with federated contrastive models. Lastly, we assess our attack performances across various datasets, including SVHN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, CIFAR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and CIFAR-100 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our attacks and underscore the privacy leakage risks inherent in the federated contrastive learning framework.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, contrastive learning has garnered significant attention due to its remarkable performance, which often matches or even surpasses that of supervised learning, despite being trained on unlabeled data. While sometimes categorized under self-supervised learning methods, contrastive learning differs from traditional approaches by eschewing proxy tasks and instead directly training the encoder <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. The selection of proxy tasks is crucial, and an inappropriate choice can lead to subpar model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, traditional self-supervised learning methods lack a universally effective validation method for assessing model performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. With the emergence of contrastive learning, these challenges have been significantly addressed.
Contrastive learning involves calculating cosine similarity for training; it generates two augmented images from the training data as positive samples, while other data in the same batch serve as negative samples. The primary objective is to bring the output of positive samples closer while distancing them from the negative sample outputs. For instance, SimCLR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> uses an encoder to produce feature vectors, which undergo projection through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to calculate contrastive loss. The model is then trained through backpropagation of this loss, and at the end of training, the MLP is discarded, leaving the trained encoder for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. This method yields high-performing models; however, it heavily relies on batch size, with a larger batch size leading to more negative samples and consequently better model performance.
An alternative approach involves utilizing a memory bank <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> to replace feature representations of negative samples without requiring an increase in the training batch size. Nonetheless, employing a memory bank entails significant computational expenses. To mitigate this, MoCo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> introduced a momentum encoder that maintains a dictionary as a data sample queue, effectively increasing the batch size by using cached embeddings from historical steps. This reduces the need for large batch sizes in a single input and enhances computational efficiency. Similarly, BYOL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> exclusively trains the encoder using positive samples.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> is a distributed machine learning method that enables multiple devices to collaborate on model training using labeled data without the necessity of sharing raw data. In the context of unlabeled data, researchers have also delved into distributed contrastive learning methods and introduced privacy-preserving federated contrastive learning (FCL) strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. These strategies maintain raw data locally while training a global encoder through the integration of local encoders. Recent studies primarily address the challenge of non-independent identically distributed (Non-IID) data in FCL.
For example, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> devise a dictionary module and an alignment module to enhance feature representation quality in Non-IID data settings. Similarly, Zhuang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> introduce a divergence-aware module to mitigate weight divergence issues in Non-IID data scenarios. They leverage local knowledge to alleviate the Non-IID problem effectively.
Huang <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> centers on the analysis of backdoor attacks targeting FCL. This research stands as the inaugural investigation into the security vulnerabilities within the FCL framework, thus motivating our investigation into the potential leakage of membership information within the FCL domain.
Furthermore, contemporary solutions have explored the application of FCL across diverse domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

Their method involves launching member inference attacks against deep learning models to infer the membership of training data through analysis of the model’s prediction results. These attacks have the potential to disclose sensitive information, such as user privacy. Shokri et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> further delineate passive and active member inference attacks.
More recently, Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> propose EncoderMI, a member inference attack on contrastive learning. This approach achieves member inference attacks by training a binary classifier based on the discrepancy in cosine similarity between member data and non-member data in augmented data.
Subsequent research has expanded the scope of member inference attacks, applying them to different types of machine learning models and scenarios, including model architecture privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, machine unlearning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, among others.</p>

To create positive and negative pairs, MoCo leverages data augmentation techniques to generate two distinct views (i.e., two samples). Matching views from the same sample constitute a positive pair, whereas views from dissimilar samples form a negative pair. The memory queue retains previous keys, enabling consideration of additional negative samples when computing the contrastive loss. Each queue element represents a feature vector derived from encoding the original data.
For the positive pair (i, j), the loss function of MoCo is defined as:</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given its distributed nature, FCL may face security concerns akin to those in FL, including membership information leakage. Membership inference attacks aim to discern whether a specific data sample was involved in the model’s training process. Attackers scrutinize the global model to identify training data samples, potentially leading to data leaks and privacy breaches, particularly when the data entails sensitive information.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">However, membership inference attacks against FCL differ notably from those targeting FL</span>. Firstly, FL’s model training typically relies on labeled data, enabling attackers to exploit this label information for membership inference attacks. In contrast, FCL participants learn an encoder in an unsupervised manner, devoid of labeled local data, rendering membership inference attacks more challenging. Secondly, the distributed nature and learning objectives of FCL diverge from those of FL. While FL aims to train a model for a specific task, FCL seeks to develop a general encoder applicable to multiple downstream tasks. As data distribution may vary across these tasks, strategies for membership inference attacks based on data distribution become less feasible.</p>

They possess the capability to adjust their local model parameters and training data, and also hold some data conforming to the same distribution as the overall training data.

Passive attackers do not engage in training or disrupt it; instead, they solely acquire the model parameters post-training and subsequently initiate membership inference attacks. Conversely, active attackers conduct gradient ascent on their local model, execute gradient ascent on the data to be inferred, transmit it to the server along with other aggregated model parameters, and subsequently compute the loss for the data subjected to gradient ascent.</p>

The gradient ascent operation leverages the discrepancy between the model’s member and non-member data, where the loss of trained data increases more gradually compared to untrained data. This divergence can be utilized to infer whether a data point is a member or non-member data. The data undergoing gradient ascent in this context is the enhanced data intended for inference. Typically, the enhancement is random. If the enhanced data used differs significantly from that during training, it may impact the final result accuracy. However, in cases of severe overfitting, satisfactory accuracy can still be attained even with dissimilar enhanced data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The second method assumes that the attacker is one of the client’s members. If the attacker aims to determine whether a set of data is member data, they can adjust their own model, utilize it to conduct gradient ascent on the data for inference, and then upload the model to the server. Upon the server aggregating and returning the model parameters, the loss or cosine similarity of the data for inference is computed to observe its alterations. This process continues, recording the loss or cosine similarity of the model with the inferred data with each issuance. A fundamental assumption here is that the attacker must possess a small amount of member data for comparison. If the loss obtained post-gradient ascent is substantially lower when contrasted with the member data, it indicates that the inferred data is member data. Conversely, a significant disparity suggests that the inferred data is non-member data.

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The mentioned attacks were implemented using PyTorch in Python 3.7, leveraging 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. While each experiment was successfully carried out across all datasets, some attack diagrams lacked significant variation, thus CIFAR-10 diagrams were used to represent them. All experiments were executed under Non-IID distributions, as this aligns more with real-world federated learning scenarios, despite IID distribution being a more effective defense against overfitting.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In passive membership inference attacks, model parameters were logged every hundred aggregation rounds for subsequent inference analysis. To expedite overfitting, the initially provided server model parameters underwent 500 rounds of pre-training. Standardizing variables, 10,000 training and test data points were combined for all datasets, utilizing both member and non-member data during membership inference operations. For active membership inference attacks, losses of member and non-member data were tracked at each aggregation round, with model parameters saved every hundred rounds for static active membership inference analysis. Local training rounds were set at 10. Although the learning rate parameters for SGD during gradient ascent and training were both 0.1, adjusting the learning rate during gradient ascent appropriately helped mitigate large loss fluctuations, resulting in a smoother curve progression.</p>

Linear evaluation gauges the feature representation extracted by the encoder through training a linear model. Meanwhile, weighted KNN evaluation classifies by comparing the cosine similarity of feature representations and utilizing a weighted voting k-nearest neighbor approach. Throughout training, weighted KNN evaluation was employed for monitoring, while linear evaluation was utilized for final performance testing.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For active membership inference attacks, the approach involves observing the rate of increase in member and non-member data loss and utilizes a threshold for inference. An appropriate loss threshold is applied to infer member and non-member data, where loss refers to the data loss after the increase minus the data loss before the increase. During the training process of the active membership inference attack, inference is made by comparing with the loss of member data. Specifically, a batch of data to be inferred undergoes gradient ascent, and the resulting loss is subtracted from the member data loss, then the difference is observed. A small difference indicates member data, whereas a large difference indicates non-member data. A threshold can also be set for the difference; if exceeded, it signifies non-member data, otherwise, it signifies member data. This method enables dynamic threshold adjustments based on specific scenarios and data characteristics.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the subsequent analysis, our focus shifts towards a generic membership inference attack predicated on the model’s internal workings. Our experimental findings reveal that an overfitted contrast learning model leads to heightened overfitting within the extracted encoder. Given that this encoder typically constitutes a deep neural network model such as <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ResNet</span> or <span id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VGG</span>, we can directly apply traditional membership inference techniques to it. This process involves utilizing the model to predict class probabilities and selecting the highest probabilities as input data for training the classifier. By providing the model with the number of classes without specific labels, it generates prediction probabilities with a notable degree of confidence, reflected in significantly elevated values for the top predictions. Thus, we posit that this approach offers a viable avenue for further exploration of the model’s privacy vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces a pioneering investigation into passive and active membership inference attacks on federated contrastive learning. Our research substantiates the potential data leakage vulnerability inherent in federated contrastive learning. Experimental findings demonstrate that an excessively overfitted model resulting from improper parameter choices or highly skewed data distribution among clients poses heightened privacy risks. The privacy concerns within federated contrastive learning warrant significant attention. In the future research, incorporating defensive measures like differential privacy and early stopping enhances the generalization capability of the federated contrastive learning model, fortifying it against membership inference attacks and privacy breaches.</p>
