<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning has emerged as a viable distributed solution to train machine learning models without the actual need to share data with the central aggregator. However, standard neural network-based federated learning models have been shown to be susceptible to data leakage from the gradients shared with the server. In this work, we introduce federated learning with variational quantum circuit model built using expressive encoding maps coupled with overparameterized ansätze. We show that expressive maps lead to inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks, while overparameterization ensures model trainability. Our privacy framework centers on the complexity of solving the system of high-degree multivariate Chebyshev polynomials generated by the gradients of quantum circuit. We present compelling arguments highlighting the inherent difficulty in solving these equations, both in exact and approximate scenarios. Additionally, we delve into machine learning-based attack strategies and establish a direct connection between overparameterization in the original federated learning model and underparameterization in the attack model. Furthermore, we provide numerical scaling arguments showcasing that underparameterization of the expressive map in the attack model leads to the loss landscape being swamped with exponentially many spurious local minima points, thus making it extremely hard to realize a successful attack. This provides a strong claim, for the first time, that the nature of quantum machine learning models inherently helps prevent data leakage in federated learning.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The recent advances in the field of machine learning, particularly deep learning, have found tremendous success across a wide variety of areas including computer vision, natural language processing, generative modeling, and time-series forecasting among many others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. With the recent explosion of the abundance of data and powerful computing models, every passing year sees increasing success and impact across the above-mentioned fields using machine learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In parallel, quantum computing, and quantum machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> in particular, has emerged as an interdisciplinary field with the potential to significantly impact a wide range of fields. Some initial results, along with theoretical guarantees, have showcased its potential computational advantage over classical machine learning tasks such as in classification, and distribution learning among others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Some notable examples of quantum machine learning algorithms include the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) for solving linear systems of equations, quantum principal component analysis, quantum generative models, quantum support vector machines, quantum branch and bound, and quantum Monte-Carlo estimation, among others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, numerous machine learning algorithms require substantial amounts of data to construct robust, high-performing models. In practice, data is often fragmented across various organizations or devices due to factors like privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>) or the logistical challenges of centralizing data collection. For instance, medical data from different hospitals is typically sensitive and confined to individual facilities. This limited and potentially biased data pool makes it challenging to develop accurate models for specific tasks, such as disease pattern identification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The imperative need for data privacy, coupled with concerns related to storage and computational resources, has seen growing interest in the field of distributed learning. One prominent solution is Federated Learning (FL), which addresses this challenge by forming a loose federation of participating devices, referred to as <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">clients</em>, all coordinated by a central server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Importantly, each client has a local training dataset which is never uploaded to the central server. Instead, each client computes an update, typically the model cost function gradient, and transmits only this gradient to the global model maintained by the central server, which we call the <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FL model</em>. The role of the server is to act as a central aggregator of the gradients in order to globally update the FL model. FL approaches have been adopted by various service providers and play a pivotal role in privacy-conscious applications where training data is distributed across multiple clients. Its potential applications are diverse, including sentiment analysis among mobile phone users, enhancing autonomous driving systems, predicting health events such as heart rate risks from wearable devices, improving image detection through data contributed by multiple phone and tablet users, and many more <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Previous studies have shown that sharing gradient information with the central <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">honest-but-curious</em> server can potentially expose clients to sensitive data leakage scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. An honest-but-curious attack model is where the server still performs the gradient aggregation, but could also perform a local gradient inversion-based attack to learn the client’s data. This compromise in privacy prevents the FL framework from becoming fully trustworthy for distributed machine learning models. While some studies have indicated that it is possible to partially protect against gradient inversion attacks by employing techniques like gradient masking and introducing random noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, or by maximizing the mixing of gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, these approaches are not completely robust. They may still leak some data information, or add substantial additional computational overhead, while also in certain cases, reducing the predictive capability of the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduce the quantum version of the federated learning framework where we replace the classical neural network-based FL models with variational quantum circuits (VQC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. We specifically consider VQCs which have a high expressive capability, meaning, they comprise a significant number of non-degenerate Fourier frequencies when representing the model output in the Fourier basis as was originally introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and later explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Our particular emphasis lies in constructing a product encoding map that leads to an exponential increase in the number of frequencies per input dimension when representing the model output and its cost function gradients as functions of the input data. Additionally, the trainable ansatz in these VQCs incorporates a sufficiently large number of trainable parameters within the variational ansatz, rendering them overparameterized <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. In particular, we consider the overparameterized hardware efficient ansatz (HEA) where the number of trainable parameters scales exponentially with the number of qubits <math id="S1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N_{q}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">N</mi><mi id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">q</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑁</ci><ci id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑞</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1c">N_{q}</annotation></semantics></math> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Our choice of expressive encoding map coupled with overparameterized ansatz ensures that the FL model would be able to easily fit a large variety of functions during training and does not suffer the problem of spurious local minima, as all the local minima points exponentially concentrate around the global minimum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our key contribution is to establish that the gradients generated by the considered VQCs result in a system of <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">multivariate Chebyshev polynomial equations</em> with an exponential degree (in the number of qubits) when expressed as a function of input i.e. in the input space<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The gradients can alternatively be written as a system of equations generated by the model output which is linear in the feature space i.e., when represented as the function of an input encoded quantum state. We also study the difficulty of learning the input by solving this system of equations in Sec. <a href="#S6.SS3.SSS7" title="VI.3.7 Solutions to systems of equations in feature space ‣ VI.3 Attack strategy for the server ‣ VI Privacy in Quantum Federated Learning ‣ Expressive variational quantum circuits provide inherent privacy in federated learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI.3.7</span></a>.</span></span></span>. Here, the number of equations is determined by the number of gradients shared, i.e., the number of trainable parameters in the model. Thus, in order to invert the gradients and subsequently learn the data, the task amounts to simultaneously solving these systems of high-degree multivariate equations. We initially tackle the inherent challenge associated with analytically solving these equations, both in exact and approximate scenarios. In the case of exact solutions, we employ techniques from computational algebraic geometry, such as Buchberger’s algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, to provide an upper bound on exact equation solving. For approximate solutions, we utilize the Nyquist-Shannon theorem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to show formulating an approximate system of equations is hard. Both these approaches require time and memory resources scaling exponentially in the number of qubits, thus providing significant privacy in our VQC based FL model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">We also investigate the challenge of retrieving client data via the machine learning technique, the most common gradient inversion attack setting in the standard neural network-based FL models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Here, the server generates dummy gradients in their attack model and trains the model with a suitable loss function to match the client’s gradients in order to learn the input. Our observation, backed by numerical results, reveals that the attack model in this context faces a significant challenge. It is severely underparameterized, yet highly expressive, meaning it incorporates an exponential number of Fourier frequencies. This results in the loss landscape being riddled with exponentially many spurious local minima which are well separated thus resulting in the untrainability of the attack model, preventing it from easily recovering the original input. This provides compelling evidence that the expressive encoding maps associated with quantum machine learning models are well placed to help prevent data leakage attacks in FL models.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy in federated learning models has been challenged by the wider community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>. Led by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and followed by many others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, it was shown that it is possible to extract input data from model gradients. Typical works on inversion attacks in federated learning of classical neural networks share the same principal of guessing the input that generate similar gradients shared by a client. Hence, the attacker goal is to optimize a proxy model to the gradients shared. The results of this attack have shown that it is possible, with relatively ease, to extract data at a pixel-level for full batch images with clarity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Bayes frameworks and generative model priors to various input data distributions have been shown to improve inversion success rates, by providing better prior distributions to circumvent several defenses and allow better convergences of various optimizers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> show how to train a generative model prior, resulting in a high success rate of attacks over several image databases.
Overall, mechanisms to enhance privacy have been proposed, but mainly relying on empirical approaches of noise addition and information compression with a range of effectiveness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. Such defenses includes dropout nodes, gradient pruning, noise injection to the gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> blending methods of training images applied online by the client nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, and also mixing gradients
strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Here, instead of standard machine learning models, we introduce trainable quantum circuits and quantum encoding as a potential resistance strategy for defense. Recent works have shown the applicability of quantum federated learning setup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> and potential added value for privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> in using quantum machine learning, however, such intuition was not analyzed nor quantified thoroughly. Here we look into the leakage of data in quantum federated learning using variational quantum circuits, and analyze privacy against a multitude of attack strategies on the client’s gradients generated using variational quantum circuits architectures.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The choice of the data-uploading unitary is the key to the performance of the VQC as it inherently decides the types of functions (or input/output relationships) that can be learned. In other words, following the results of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the output of a variational quantum circuit can be written in the Fourier function basis where the frequency spectrum is solely determined by the expressive capability of the quantum encoding map. This implies that the VQC model’s capability to learn any unknown function increases as one increases the expressivity of the encoding map. In the following sections, we also show that expressivity is directly tied to data privacy in the quantum federated learning setup where the intuition is that a highly expressible encoding map would create a very complex polynomial system of equations for the server to solve which directly ties to the hardness in retrieving the client’s data.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike the classical neural network, where the gradients of the cost function are estimated via back propagation, the VQC does not directly offer this possibility. This is primarily because back-propagation would destroy the quantum superposition of the state and thus the data would be irretrievably lost. One could instead perform a finite-difference calculation to estimate the gradients, but this can be too error prone to compute when using hardware, due to inherent gate noise in the quantum system. To resolve this, the authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> proposed an analytic version of computing quantum circuit gradients using what is referred as the parameter shift rule.</p>

The aim is to learn the underlying relationship between the example vectors and their labels by training the VQC model under the constraint that the client data is processed and stored locally, with only the intermediate updates being communicated periodically with a central server. In particular, the goal is to minimize the mean squared error loss function as in Eq. <a href="#S4.E21" title="In IV.1.3 Cost function ‣ IV.1 Variational quantum circuit ‣ IV Quantum Federated Learning ‣ Expressive variational quantum circuits provide inherent privacy in federated learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">21</span></a> with the gradient-based method.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to privacy, we also desire the FL models to be expressive and trainable. For this precise reason, we consider our trainable ansatz to be overparameterized, which we implement in this case using a number of trainable parameters that scale exponentially in the number of qubits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Overparameterization offers a multitude of benefits in the FL model, namely this makes the quantum model <em id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">fully expressive</em> by allowing complete control in tuning of parameterized coefficients in Eq. <a href="#S5.E54" title="In V.1.2 Multivariate input analysis ‣ V.1 General VQC Fourier expansion ‣ V Expressivity of VQC ‣ Expressive variational quantum circuits provide inherent privacy in federated learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">54</span></a>. Further, as highlighted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, overparameterization substantially improves the trainability of FL model by getting rid of spurious local minima i.e. the local minima are no longer well separated from the global minimum but rather concentrated around the global minimum. This further implies that any trainability issues in retrieving client input during a gradient inversion attack is isolated to the attack side of training and reflects an increased privacy in the model.</p>

Furthermore, we consider privacy in the <em id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">worst-case</em> data leakage setting for the clients, where the clients execute their quantum circuits perfectly without any noise and compute and share the cost function gradients exactly. We showcase that even in this ideal setting, the server is unable to easily learn the client’s data We note that this is the best case scenario for the server trying the learn the data, as a setting with experimental errors would introduce further noise in the cost function gradients, thus making it harder to learn the data input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>. Here we showcase the privacy when the cost function chosen by all the clients is the mean-squared error.

This would require training data comprising of gradient values alongside their true input values in order to learn the mapping. Generating this training dataset would then require evaluating gradients of quantum circuits many times in order to generate sufficient training data.
Furthermore, we expect that the number of training samples required to learn this relationship would likely scale with the highest frequency term so as to not violate the Nyquist-Shannon Theorem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Therefore, there is no practical purely classical machine learning attack, as any classical algorithm will require sampling a quantum circuit potentially exponentially many times in order to initially train the classical model.</p>

It should be noted that this result is for a general system of polynomials.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we highlight that variational quantum circuits consisting of expressive encoding maps and overparameterized ansätze naturally provide privacy in the context of federated learning. We discern that expressive quantum circuits inherently possess a feature map which transforms classical data into a higher-dimensional Hilbert space resulting in quantum models that encompass high-degree Fourier frequencies. This results in the necessity to solve a system of very high degree Chebyshev polynomials in the input space in order to learn the underlying data. We analyze various techniques of solving such a system of equations, either via trying to solve them analytically, or by using a machine learning-based attack. Our observation is that all these methods lead to an exponential (in the number of qubits) hardness in recovering the underlying client’s input.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.2" class="ltx_p">We primarily notice that expressive quantum circuits, when underparameterized in terms of optimizable variables, give rise to hard to train loss landscapes in the machine learning-based attack. In the case studied here, the attack model’s underparameterization in the optimizable variable <math id="S8.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{x}^{\prime}" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.p2.1.m1.1a"><msup id="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝐱</mi><mo id="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">′</mo></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐱</ci><ci id="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S8.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">′</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathbf{x}^{\prime}</annotation></semantics></math> renders it challenging to train, while, conversely, the FL model being overparameterized in its optimizable variable <math id="S8.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\boldsymbol{\theta}" display="inline"><semantics id="S8.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S8.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S8.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝜽</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S8.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S8.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S8.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝜽</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S8.p2.2.m2.1c">\boldsymbol{\theta}</annotation></semantics></math> ensures it can be trained without suffering from the issue of spurious local minima.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This inherent dichotomy between overparameterization and underparameterization ensures that while FL models can excel in their designated learning tasks, they simultaneously offer enhanced privacy. Both our theoretical and empirical findings indicate that high-frequency terms contribute to periodic loss functions that are exponentially hard to optimize. This revelation prompts the intriguing question: <em id="S8.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Could classical federated learning techniques potentially benefit from incorporating highly periodic feature maps during a data preprocessing phase, drawing inspiration from quantum circuit feature maps?</em></p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It remains an open question whether classical machine learning methods can effectively navigate this feature space, or if expressive variational quantum circuits are intrinsically better suited for training within these highly periodic feature domains. Future research could also explore the efficacy of quantum encodings which are hard to simulate classically. In this context, our work introduces a novel paradigm in quantum machine learning where a quantum algorithm’s success isn’t solely gauged by its ability to outperform its classical counterpart in terms of model metrics, but also by its potential to offer superior privacy.</p>
