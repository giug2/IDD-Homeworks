<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning, multiple client devices jointly learn a machine learning model: each client device maintains a local model for its local training dataset, while a master device maintains a global model via aggregating the local models from the client devices. The machine learning community recently proposed several federated learning methods that were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures (e.g., system failures, adversarial manipulations) of certain client devices.
In this work, we perform the first systematic study on <em id="id15.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local model poisoning attacks</em> to federated learning. We assume an attacker has compromised some client devices, and the attacker manipulates the local model parameters on the compromised client devices during the learning process such that the global model has a large testing error rate. We formulate our attacks as optimization problems and apply our attacks to four recent Byzantine-robust federated learning methods. Our empirical results on four real-world datasets show that our attacks can substantially increase the error rates of the models learnt by the federated learning methods that were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures of some client devices.
We generalize two defenses for data poisoning attacks to defend against our local model poisoning attacks.
Our evaluation results show that one defense can effectively defend against our attacks in some cases, but the defenses are not effective enough in other cases, highlighting the need for new defenses against our local model poisoning attacks to federated learning.</p>

These users/organizations do not want to share their local training datasets, but still desire to jointly learn a model. For instance, multiple hospitals may desire to learn a healthcare model without sharing their sensitive data to each other.
Each client device (called <em id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">worker device</em>) maintains a <em id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local model</em> for its local training dataset. Moreover, the service provider has a <em id="S1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">master device</em> (e.g., cloud server), which maintains a <em id="S1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global model</em>. Roughly speaking, federated learning repeatedly performs three steps: the master device sends the current global model to worker devices; worker devices update their local models using their local training datasets and the global model, and send the local models to the master device; and the master device computes a new global model via aggregating the local models according to a certain <em id="S1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">aggregation rule</em>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, the <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">mean</em> aggregation rule that takes the average of the local model parameters as the global model is widely used under non-adversarial settings. However, the global model can be arbitrarily manipulated for mean even if just one worker device is compromised <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the machine learning community recently proposed multiple aggregation rules (e.g., Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, Bulyan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, trimmed mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>, and median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>), which aimed to be robust against Byzantine failures of certain worker devices.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Existing data poisoning attacks are insufficient:</span> 
We consider attacks that aim to manipulate the <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">training phase</em> of machine learning such that the learnt model (we consider the model to be a classifier) has a high testing error rate indiscriminately for testing examples, which makes the model unusable and eventually leads to denial-of-service attacks. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Local Model Poisoning Attacks to Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the training phase, which includes two components, i.e., <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">training dataset collection</em> and <em id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">learning process</em>. The training dataset collection component is to collect a training dataset, while the learning process component produces a model from a given training dataset. Existing attacks mainly inject malicious data into the training dataset before the learning process starts, while the learning process is assumed to maintain integrity. Therefore, these attacks are often called <em id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">data poisoning attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite>. In federated learning, an attacker could only inject the malicious data into the worker devices that are under the attacker’s control. As a result, these data poisoning attacks have limited success to attack Byzantine-robust federated learning (see our experimental results in Section <a href="#S4.SS4" title="4.4 Comparing with Back-gradient Optimization based Attack ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Local Model Poisoning Attacks to Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4</span></a>).</p>

We assume the attacker has control of some worker devices and manipulates the local model parameters sent from these devices to the master device during the learning process. The attacker may or may not know the aggregation rule used by the master device. To contrast with data poisoning attacks, we call our attacks local model poisoning attacks as they directly manipulate the local model parameters.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Local model poisoning attacks.</span> A key challenge of local model poisoning attacks is how to craft the local models sent from the compromised worker devices to the master device. To address this challenge, we formulate crafting local models as solving an optimization problem in each iteration of federated learning. Specifically, the master device could compute a global model in an iteration if there are no attacks, which we call <em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">before-attack</em> global model. Our goal is to craft the local models on the compromised worker devices such that the global model deviates the most towards the inverse of the direction along which the before-attack global model would change. Our intuition is that the deviations accumulated over multiple iterations would make the learnt global model differ from the before-attack one significantly.
We apply our attacks to four recent Byzantine-robust federated learning methods including Krum, Bulyan, trimmed mean, and median.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our evaluation results on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CH-MNIST, and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets
show that our attacks can substantially increase the error rates of the global models under various settings of federated learning. For instance, when learning a deep neural network classifier for MNIST using Krum, our attack can increase the error rate from 0.11 to 0.75. Moreover, we compare with data poisoning attacks including <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">label flipping attacks</em> and <em id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">back-gradient optimization based attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> (state-of-the-art untargeted data poisoning attacks for multi-class classifiers), which poison the local training datasets on the compromised worker devices. We find that these data poisoning attacks have limited success to attack the Byzantine-robust federated learning methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Defenses.</span> Existing defenses against data poisoning attacks essentially aim to sanitize the training dataset.
One category of defenses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> detects malicious data based on their negative impact on the error rate of the learnt model. For instance, <em id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Reject on Negative Impact (RONI)</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> measures the impact of each training example on the error rate of the learnt model and removes the training examples that have large negative impact. Another category of defenses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> leverages new loss functions, solving which detects malicious data and learns a model simultaneously. For instance, Jagielski et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed TRIM, which aims to jointly find a subset of training dataset with a given size and model parameters that minimize the loss function. The training examples that are not in the selected subset are treated as malicious data. However, these defenses are not directly applicable for our local model poisoning attacks because our attacks do not inject malicious data into the training dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">To address the challenge, we generalize RONI and TRIM to defend against our local model poisoning attacks. Both defenses remove the local models that are potentially malicious before computing the global model using a Byzantine-robust aggregation rule in each iteration. One defense removes the local models that have large negative impact on the error rate of the global model (inspired by RONI that removes training examples that have large negative impact on the error rate of the model), while the other defense removes the local models that result in large loss (inspired by TRIM that removes the training examples that have large negative impact on the loss), where the error rate and loss are evaluated on a validation dataset. We call the two defenses <em id="S1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Error Rate based Rejection (ERR)</em> and <em id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Loss Function based Rejection (LFR)</em>, respectively. Moreover, we combine ERR and LFR, i.e., we remove the local models that are removed by either ERR or LFR. Our empirical evaluation results show that LFR outperforms ERR; and the combined defense is comparable to LFR in most cases. Moreover, LFR can defend against our attacks in certain cases, but LFR is not effective enough in other cases. For instance, LFR can effectively defend against our attacks that craft local models based on the trimmed mean aggregation rule, but LFR is not effective against our attacks that are based on the Krum aggregation rule. Our results show that we need new defense mechanisms to defend against our local model poisoning attacks.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A naive aggregation rule is to average the local model parameters as the global model parameters.
This <em id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">mean</em> aggregation rule is widely used under non-adversarial settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. However, mean is not robust under adversarial settings. In particular, an attacker can manipulate the global model parameters arbitrarily for this mean aggregation rule when compromising only one worker device <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, the machine learning community has recently developed multiple aggregation rules that aim to be robust even if certain worker devices exhibit Byzantine failures.
Next, we review several such aggregation rules.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Aggregation rule.</span>
We consider two scenarios depending on whether the attacker knows the aggregation rule or not. In particular, the attacker could know the aggregation rule in various scenarios.
For instance, the service provider may make the aggregation rule public in order to increase transparency and trust of the federated learning system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
When the attacker does not know the aggregation rule, we will craft local model parameters for the compromised worker devices based on a certain aggregation rule. Our empirical results show that such crafted local models could also attack other aggregation rules. In particular, we observe different levels of <em id="S2.SS3.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">transferability</em> of our local model poisoning attacks between different aggregation rules.</p>

In the full knowledge scenario, the attacker knows the local training dataset and local model on every worker device.
We note that the full knowledge scenario has limited applicability in practice for federated learning as the training dataset is decentralized on many worker devices, and we use it to estimate the <em id="S2.SS3.p6.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">upper bound</em> of our attacks’ threats for a given setting of federated learning.

For instance, Suciu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> recently proposed to characterize an attacker’s background knowledge and capability for data poisoning attacks with respect to multiple dimensions such as <em id="S2.SS3.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Feature</em>, <em id="S2.SS3.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Algorithm</em>, and <em id="S2.SS3.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Instance</em>.

deviation goal for trimmed mean and median aggregation rules.

First, these results show that our attacks are effective and substantially outperform existing attacks, i.e., our attacks result in higher error rates. For instance, when dataset is MNIST, classifier is LR, and aggregation rule is Krum, our partial knowledge attack increases the error rate from 0.14 to 0.72 (around 400% relative increase).
Gaussian attacks only increase the error rates in several cases, e.g., median aggregation rule for Fashion-MNIST, and trimmed mean and median for CH-MNIST. Label flipping attacks can increase the error rates for DNN classifiers in some cases but have limited success for LR classifiers.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Second, Krum is less robust to our attacks than trimmed mean and median, except on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) where Krum is comparable to median. A possible reason why trimmed mean and median outperform Krum is that Krum picks one local model as the global model, while trimmed mean and median aggregate multiple local models to update the global model (the median selects one local model parameter for each model parameter, but the selected parameters may be from different local models). Trimmed mean is more robust to our attacks in some cases while median is more robust in other cases. Third, we observe that the error rates may depend on the data dimension. For instance, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST have 784 dimensions, CH-MNIST has 4096 dimensions, and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) has 30 dimensions. For the DNN classifiers, the error rates are higher on CH-MNIST than on other datasets in most cases, while the error rates are lower on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) than on other datasets in most cases.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We note that federated learning may have higher error rate than centralized learning, even if robustness feature is not considered (i.e., mean aggregation rule is used). For instance, the DNN classifiers respectively achieve testing error rates 0.01, 0.08, 0.07, and 0.01 in centralized learning on the four datasets, while they respectively achieve testing error rates 0.04, 0.09, 0.09, and 0.01 in federated learning with the mean aggregation rule on the four datasets.
However, in the scenarios where users’ training data can only be stored on their edge/mobile devices, e.g., for privacy purposes, centralized learning is not applicable and federated learning may be the only option even though its error rate is higher. Compared to the mean aggregation rule, Byzantine-robust aggregation rule increases the error rate without attacks. However, if Byzantine-robust aggregation rule is not used, a single malicious device can make the learnt global model totally useless <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. To summarize, in the scenarios where users’ training data can only be stored on their edge/mobile devices and there may exist attacks, Byzantine-robust federated learning may be the best option, even if its error rate is higher.</p>

Our attacks increase the error rates significantly as we compromise more worker devices; label flipping only slightly increases the error rates; and Gaussian attacks have no notable impact on the error rates. Two exceptions are that Krum’s error rates decrease when the percentage of compromised worker devices increases from 5% to 10% in Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf1" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 4.2 Results for Known Aggregation Rule ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Local Model Poisoning Attacks to Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2a</span></a> and from 10% to 15% in Figure <a href="#S4.F2.sf4" title="In Figure 2 ‣ 4.2 Results for Known Aggregation Rule ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Local Model Poisoning Attacks to Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2d</span></a>. We suspect the reason is that Krum selects one local model as a global model in each iteration. We have similar observations on the other datasets. Therefore, we omit the corresponding results for simplicity.</p>

Error rates of all attacks including no attacks increase as we increase the degree of non-IID, except that the error rates of our attacks to Krum fluctuate as the degree of non-IID increases. A possible reason is that as the local training datasets on different worker devices are more non-IID, the local models are more diverse, leaving more room for attacks. For instance, an extreme example is that if the local models on the benign worker devices are the same, it would be harder to attack the aggregation rules, because their aggregated model would be more likely to depend on the benign local models.</p>

The testing error rates decrease as we use more rounds of stochastic gradient descent for both no attack and our partial knowledge attack. This is because more rounds of stochastic gradient descent lead to more accurate local models, and the local models on different worker devices are less diverse, leaving a smaller attack space. However, our attack still increases the error rates substantially even if we use more rounds. For instance, our attack still increases the error rate by more than 30% when using 10 rounds of stochastic gradient descent. We note that a large number of rounds result in large computational cost for worker devices, which may be unacceptable for resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and IoT devices.</p>

Our attack is more effective (i.e., testing error rate is larger) as the federated learning system involves more worker devices. We found a possible reason is that our partial knowledge attacks can more accurately estimate the changing directions with more worker devices. For instance, for trimmed mean of the DNN classifier on MNIST, our partial knowledge attacks can correctly estimate the changing directions of 72% of the global model parameters on average when there are 50 worker devices, and this fraction increases to 76% when there are 100 worker devices.</p>

However, our attacks are still effective. For instance, for the Krum, trimmed mean, and median aggregation rules, our partial knowledge attacks still increase the testing error rates by 590%, 100%, and 83%, respectively.  Another training strategy is to roll back to a few iterations ago if the master device detects an unusual increase of training error rate. However, such training strategy is not applicable because the training error rates of the global models still decrease until convergence when we perform our attacks in each iteration. In other words, there are no unusual increases of training error rates.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Back-gradient optimization based attack (BGA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>
is state-of-the-art untargeted data poisoning attack for multi-class classifiers such as multi-class LR and DNN. BGA formulates a bilevel optimization problem, where the inner optimization is to minimize the training loss on the poisoned training data and the outer optimization is to find poisoning examples that maximize the minimal training loss in the inner optimization. BGA iteratively finds the poisoned examples by alternately solving the inner minimization and outer maximization problems.
We implemented BGA and verified that our implementation can reproduce the results reported by the authors.
However, BGA is not scalable to the entire MNIST dataset. Therefore, we uniformly sample 6,000 training examples in MNIST, and we learn a 10-class LR classifier. Moreover, we assume 100 worker devices, randomly distribute the 6,000 examples to them, and assume 20 worker devices are compromised.</p>

Moreover, we sample 100 testing examples uniformly at random as the validation dataset. Each row of the table corresponds to a defense, e.g., Krum + ERR means that the master device uses ERR to remove the potentially malicious local models and uses Krum as the aggregation rule. Each column indicates the attacker’s assumed aggregation rule when performing attacks, e.g., the column “Krum” corresponds to attacks that are based on Krum. We have several observations.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">First, LFR is comparable to ERR or much more effective than ERR, i.e., LFR achieves similar or much smaller testing error rates than ERR. For instance, Trimmed mean + ERR and Trimmed mean + LFR achieve similar testing error rates (0.17 vs. 0.18) when the attacker crafts the compromised local models based on Krum. However, Trimmed mean + LFR achieves a much smaller testing error rate than Trimmed mean + ERR (0.12 vs. 0.21), when the attacker crafts the compromised local models based on trimmed mean. Second, Union is comparable to LFR in most cases, except one case (Krum + LFR vs. Krum and Krum + Union vs. Krum) where Union is more effective.</p>

<p id="S5.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Third, LFR and Union can effectively defend against our attacks in some cases. For instance, Trimmed mean + LFR (or Trimmed mean + Union) achieves the same testing error rate for both no attack and attack based on trimmed mean. However, our attacks are still effective in other cases even if LFR or Union is adopted. For instance, an attack, which crafts compromised local models based on Krum,
still effectively increases the error rate from 0.14 (no attack) to 0.58 (314% relative increase) for Krum + LFR. Fourth, the testing error rate grows in some cases when a defense is deployed. This is because the defenses may remove benign local models, which increases the testing error rate of the global model.</p>

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Depending on the goal of a poisoning attack, we can classify poisoning attacks into two categories, i.e., <em id="S6.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">untargeted poisoning attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> and <em id="S6.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">targeted poisoning attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Untargeted poisoning attacks aim to make the learnt model have a high testing error indiscriminately for testing examples, which eventually result in a denial-of-service attack.
In targeted poisoning attacks, the learnt model produces attacker-desired predictions for particular testing examples, e.g., predicting spams as non-spams and predicting attacker-desired labels for testing examples with a particular trojan trigger (these attacks are also known as <em id="S6.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdoor/trojan attacks</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>). However, the testing error for other testing examples is unaffected.
Our local model poisoning attacks are untargeted poisoning attacks. Different from existing untargeted poisoning attacks that focus on centralized machine learning, our attacks are optimized for Byzantine-robust federated learning. We note that Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> proposed inner product manipulation based untargeted poisoning attacks to Byzantine-robust federated learning including Krum and median, which is concurrent to our work.</p>

<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Defenses:</span>  Existing defenses were mainly designed for data poisoning attacks to centralized machine learning. They essentially aim to detect the injected malicious data in the training dataset. One category of defenses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> detects malicious data based on their (negative) impact on the performance of the learnt model.
For instance,
Barreno et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposed <em id="S6.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Reject on Negative Impact (RONI)</em>, which measures the impact of each training example on the performance of the learnt model and removes the training examples that have large negative impact. Suciu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> proposed a variant of RONI (called tRONI) for targeted poisoning attacks. In particular, tRONI measures the impact of a training example on only the target classification and excludes training examples that have large impact.</p>

For instance,
Jagielski et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> proposed TRIM, which aims to jointly find a subset of training dataset with a given size and model parameters that minimize the loss function. The training examples that are not in the selected subset are treated as malicious data.
These defenses are not directly applicable for our local model poisoning attacks because our attacks do not inject malicious data into the training dataset.</p>

<div id="S6.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p6.1" class="ltx_p">For federated learning, the machine learning community recently proposed several aggregation rules (e.g., Krum <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, Bulyan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, trimmed mean <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>, median <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>, and others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>) that were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures of certain worker devices. Our work shows that these defenses are not effective in practice against our optimized local model poisoning attacks that carefully craft local models on the compromised worker devices. Fung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed to compute weight for each worker device according to historical local models and take the weighted average of the local models to update the global model. However, their method can only defend against label flipping attacks, which can already be defended by existing Byzantine-robust aggregation rules. We propose ERR and LFR, which are respectively generalized from RONI and TRIM, to defend against our local model poisoning attacks. We find that these defenses are not effective enough in some scenarios, highlighting the needs of new defenses against our attacks.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We demonstrate that the federated learning methods, which the machine learning community claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures of some worker devices, are vulnerable to our local model poisoning attacks that manipulate the local models sent from the compromised worker devices to the master device during the learning process. In particular, to increase the error rates of the learnt global models, an attacker can craft the local models on the compromised worker devices such that the aggregated global model deviates the most towards the inverse of the direction along which the global model would change when there are no attacks. Moreover, finding such crafted local models can be formulated as optimization problems. We can generalize existing defenses for data poisoning attacks to defend against our local model poisoning attacks. Such generalized defenses are effective in some cases but are not effective enough in other cases. Our results highlight that we need new defenses to defend against our local model poisoning attacks.</p>
