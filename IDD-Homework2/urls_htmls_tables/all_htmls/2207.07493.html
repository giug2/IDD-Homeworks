<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) is a novel learning paradigm that addresses the privacy leakage challenge of centralized learning. However, in FL, users with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) characteristics can deteriorate the performance of the global model. Specifically, the global model suffers from the weight divergence challenge owing to non-IID data. To address the aforementioned challenge, we propose a novel diffusion strategy of the machine learning (ML) model (FedDif) to maximize the FL performance with non-IID data. In FedDif, users spread local models to neighboring users over D2D communications. FedDif enables the local model to experience different distributions before parameter aggregation. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that FedDif can circumvent the weight divergence challenge. On the theoretical basis, we propose the communication-efficient diffusion strategy of the ML model, which can determine the trade-off between the learning performance and communication cost based on auction theory. The performance evaluation results show that FedDif improves the test accuracy of the global model by 10.37% compared to the baseline FL with non-IID settings. Moreover, FedDif improves the number of consumed sub-frames by 1.28 to 2.85 folds to the latest methods except for the model compression scheme. FedDif also improves the number of transmitted models by 1.43 to 2.67 folds to the latest methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As interests in the privacy of user data emerge, and a novel distributed learning paradigm has been proposed for users to participate in the training process. Federated learning (FL) is a representative method for training the machine learning (ML) model without leaking users’ privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. It preserves the privacy of user data via two procedures: <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local training</em> and <em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global aggregation</em>. Specifically, a central server distributes the global model to users, and users train the local model using their private data (<em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local training</em>). Furthermore, the central server collects local models from users and updates the global model (<em id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global aggregation</em>).
Global aggregation is an essential part of FL for capturing both advantages of maintaining the learning performance and preserving user data privacy.
Through the procedures of FL, the privacy of user data can be protected because eavesdroppers or honest-but-curious servers cannot infer users’ private data but solely collect parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although FL can protect users’ data privacy in training, it still faces a crucial issue when training user data. The abnormal user data may degrade the learning performance by disturbing the training of the ML model. While the central server can directly curate a training dataset in centralized learning, it cannot manage the data of each user in FL. Specifically, in FL, malicious or non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data can incur severe performance degradation as abnormal data. Regarding malicious data injection, adversaries can manipulate the result of the global model by exploiting the characteristics of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Several studies based on advanced security techniques such as differential privacy, adversary detection, and down-weighting are proposed to prevent malicious data injection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Performance degradation by non-IID user data may be a severer issue in FL. When users train the local model with their non-IID data, it may cause performance degradation of the global model regardless of any intention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. In particular, training a local model with non-IID data may induce the over-fitted local model, and the biased parameters of the local model may permeate into the global model. Consequently, the global aggregation of biased models may lead to weight divergence of the global model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Reducing the weight divergence of the global model is crucial to maintain the learning performance in FL. Several studies have been proposed to reduce biases that occurred by non-IID data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. These studies facilitate addressing the performance degradation challenges by non-IID data. However, issues at another facet, such as additional privacy leakage, weight divergence, and prolonged training time, remain open.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This study presents a novel diffusion strategy of machine learning models called <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">FedDif</em> to improve the performance of a global model with non-IID data and minimize the required communication rounds. First, we discover some insights for designing FedDif by discussing the following question: <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">“Is it possible to obtain the same effect of training the IID data by training the local models with multiple non-IID data before global aggregation?”</em> We re-think the general concept of FL that the user trains the ML model to the fact that the model learns the different users’ data. In FedDif, each user is considered as non-IID batch data, and models learn various non-IID data by passing through multiple users before global aggregation. User data have non-IID characteristics because they are personalized and biased to a particular class. Therefore, we propose the diffusion mechanism in which users relay models to train more diverse data to models. Consequently, we can achieve a similar effect as the model trains IID data via enough diffusion iterations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although the diffusion mechanism can mitigate the effects of the non-IID data, excessive diffusion may substantially increase the total training time and deteriorate the performance of the communication system. In other words, there is a trade-off between improving learning performance and minimizing communication costs. To analyze the communication cost of the diffusion mechanism, we consider two types of communication resources: frequency and time domain resources. Immoderate diffusion can deteriorate the network performance because users can over-occupy bandwidth for sending their model. Adversely, passive diffusion can require more time-domain resources to achieve the targeted performance. Thus, an efficient scheduling method should be designed for the communication-efficient diffusion mechanism by reducing the required communication resources and training time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We first construct an optimization problem to find the optimal scheduling policy for FedDif by introducing two variables: IID distance and communication cost. IID distance represents how much is the learned data distribution of the model uniformly distributed. Then, we provide the theoretical analysis of the diffusion mechanism by demonstrating that the diffusion mechanism can mitigate weight divergence. Moreover, our analysis provides a guideline for optimization by demonstrating that the scheduling policy should assign the next users who can minimize the IID distance of models. Finally, we propose the diffusion strategy to find a feasible solution for the optimization problem based on the auction theory.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advances in FL have focused on efficiency improvement of the training process, defense against various attacks, and training under the heterogeneous environment of users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. In particular, studies on training under the heterogeneous environment of users, such as training with non-IID user data, have recently become one of the most crucial issues on FL owing to the personalized user data. The cooperative FL is a representative method to train various personalized data and improve the efficiency of FL. The communication efficiency of FL is also considered because the server and users are obliged to exchange the ML model. In this section, we will introduce the previous works on FL with non-IID data, cooperative FL, and communication-efficient FL, which are the aim of our proposed strategy in this paper.</p>

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several studies have investigated the effect of the heterogeneous environment of users on the performance of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Specifically, the non-IID user data, called <em id="S2.SS0.SSS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">statistical heterogeneity</em>, may significantly decline its learning performance owing to several causes, such as weight divergence and gradient exploding. Zhao <em id="S2.SS0.SSS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> theoretically demonstrated that the earth mover’s distance (EMD) between users’ non-IID data and the population distribution causes the weight divergence. Moreover, the authors proposed a data-sharing strategy. In wireless networks, the authors of the study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> practically analyzed the performance of FL with non-IID data. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed the data augmentation scheme in which user data is formed as IID based on the generative model. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed the fine-tuning scheme of the global model based on shared user data. However, the privacy leakage of user data and costly communications on the data-sharing schemes still exist.</p>

These studies mitigate the effect of non-IID data in the global model by adaptively adjusting the weight of the local model based on the weight regularization techniques. They can internally improve the performance of the global model in FL with non-IID data without any interactions among users. Adversely, our proposed FedDif focuses on exchanging knowledge of the different user datasets among the local model by diffusing the model in wireless networks. Thus, FedDif can externally improve the performance of FL in synergy with the weight regularization methods.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a D2D-assisted hierarchical federated learning scheme that significantly reduces the traffic load via D2D grouping and master user selection in the group.

We further propose the universal strategy of training the ML model in FL by considering the cumulative experience of user data for the ML model and communication costs for diffusion.</p>

Although there are two types of communication, such as control messages and model transmissions, we assume the model transmissions as the communication cost. We employ D2D communications with overlying cellular networks in which D2D pairs equally utilize the uplink data channels with CUEs for the model transmission. To prevent the failure of securing the global model, we assume that BS<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>There are many studies for fully decentralized FL in which BS does not aggregate local models, but one of PUEs does. We design our proposed diffusion mechanism based on the centralized FL because we focus on the effect of the diffusion mechanism in the typical FL system. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDif for fully decentralized FL in Appendix D-A of our paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There is a trade-off between the communication cost spent for the diffusion and the learning performance of the global model. For example, FedDif can require more communication resources than vanilla FL in the short term. However, in the long term, the entire iterations for obtaining the required performance of the global model may decrease because the optimization trajectory of the global model after the diffusion can become much closer to the optimal trajectory than vanilla FL. FedDif aims to coordinate the trade-off by finding the optimal diffusion chain whose PUEs maximize the decrement of IID distance and minimize the communication cost.</p>

Note that the decrement of IID distance decides the sign of the diffusion efficiency. For example, the decrement of IID distance is positive if the IID distance decrease, which means that the DoL becomes much closer to the uniform distribution. Moreover, the diffusion efficiency may decrease when the communication resources are not enough to diffuse models, or the decrement is trivial against the required resources.</p>

It is difficult to obtain the solution directly because the set of feasible solutions is discrete. Therefore, based on the auction theory, we will design the diffusion strategy for finding a feasible solution that simultaneously minimizes the IID distance and required spectral resources. In the following section, we will provide a theoretical basis for the feasible solutions that can relieve the weight divergence problem and minimize IID distance.</p>

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although FedDif improves the learning performance of FL, it may become a critical issue for FedDif to require additional communication resources for diffusion. The diffusion mechanism may consume immoderate communication resources if PUEs send local models to minimize the IID distance without considering the channel condition. For example, PUEs may transmit the model to maximize the learning performance despite poor channel conditions. This may deteriorate the communication quality of the entire UEs in the networks and prolong the entire training time. Therefore, designing a communication-efficient diffusion strategy is important to determine the trade-off between learning performance and communication costs. Auction theory enables the diffusion strategy to find a feasible solution that maximizes learning performance and minimizes communication costs. Moreover, the theory is suitable for all users to achieve their objectives competitively without sharing private data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After sending bids to BS, the BS determines the auction winners. The BS may achieve a maximum decrement of IID distance when it selects PUEs with the highest bidding price as the auction winner. However, PUEs require more bandwidth to send the model due to the poor channel condition. Moreover, errors may occur in the model because the model transmissions via the poor channel may increase the bit error rate. Thus, the BS should select the winner PUEs by considering the diffusion efficiency, which includes the IID distance and required bandwidth for the model transmission.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we provide the theoretical analysis of FedDif, which can obtain a similar effect to training with IID data under the FL with non-IID data. Specifically, we aim to prove that FedDif can reduce biases due to non-IID data. First, we investigate the relationship between learning performance and the probability distance of user data. We further prove that FedDif can reduce the probability distance when PUEs sufficiently diffuse models. Based on the given proof, we finally provide some remarks on how FedDif can mitigate the weight divergence with enough diffusion.</p>

<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The optimal points of local models trained by different users may diverge because the entire training data are distributed over users in FL. Aggregating parameters of local models optimized in different directions may decline the performance of the global model. However, adversely, training the local models in a similar optimization direction can mitigate the performance degradation of the global model. We try to induce the direction of local models to a similar direction by spreading them to learn various non-IID data distributions before the global aggregation. Thus, we prove that the diffusion mechanism can approximate the global model to the model trained with IID data.</p>

In other words, FedDif aims to train the model evenly for every class. This can be achieved by minimizing the IID distance, which measures the similarity between the DoL of the model and uniform distribution. However, in the real world, PUEs’ dataset is highly heterogeneous, i.e., each PUE has a different data size or imbalanced data. Moreover, if the channel condition is poor or there are no neighboring PUEs nearby, the model may not find a user with optimal DSI. Therefore, we will demonstrate that the real-world IID distance can converge to zero when there are enough diffusion rounds as the following Lemma <a href="#Thmlem2" title="Lemma 2. ‣ Proof. ‣ Proposition 2. ‣ V Theoretical analysis ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

We also evaluate FedDif with the ML models with a convex loss function such as support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression. CNN is evaluated by the CIFAR-10 dataset. Models with relatively simple architecture, such as LSTM, FCN, SVM, and logistic regression, are evaluated by the FMNIST dataset. We set the learning rate, the momentum of SGD, and batch size as 0.01, 0.9, and 16, respectively. Note that the baseline ML task of our experiment is the image classification based on the CNN model. Finally, we consider the vanilla FL with no diffusion as the baseline FL.</p>

FedDif aims to improve learning performance while minimizing the required bandwidth in the model transmissions. Concerning communications, PUEs require more sub-frames to transmit their model while increasing the required bandwidth. We define learning performance as the <em id="S6.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">test accuracy</em> of the global model after each global aggregation step and communication cost as the <em id="S6.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">required bandwidth</em> for the model transmission. Simply comparing the number of communication rounds and diffusion rounds is insufficient to verify communication efficiency. We introduce <em id="S6.SS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">target accuracy</em> to evaluate communication efficiency. Note that we set the target accuracy as the peak accuracy of the baseline FL. We measure communication efficiencies as <em id="S6.SS1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the number of consumed sub-frames and models</em> until achieving the target accuracy. We can directly compare the long-term communication costs between FedDif and the baseline FL because the numbers of consumed sub-frames and models are related to the actually consumed bandwidth.</p>

<p id="S6.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To show the efficiency of our proposed method, we measure the test accuracy, the number of diffusion rounds, and the communication efficiency metrics with commonly used ML models and datasets. In Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-B Discussion on the degree of non-IID ‣ VI Experimental analysis ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we investigate the learning performance and communication costs of FedDif and the baseline FL for the various ML tasks. The ML tasks comprise Logistic, SVM, FCN, LSTM with FMNIST, and CNN with CIFAR10. For simplicity, we will call the ML tasks the model’s name, for example, CNN with CIFAR10 to CNN. We set the concentration parameter, minimum tolerable IID distance, and minimum tolerable QoS as 1.0, 0.04, and 1.0, respectively. We also set the target accuracy as the peak accuracy of the baseline FL for each task, i.e., 83.87%, 83.70%, 83.74%, 88.54%, and 77.94%, where Logistic, SVM, FCN, LSTM, and CNN, respectively.</p>

In CNN and LSTM, FedDif outperforms the baseline FL. Other cases, such as Logistic, SVM, and FCN, show similar performance, but the communication costs of FedAvg are higher than FedDif, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-B Discussion on the degree of non-IID ‣ VI Experimental analysis ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(b). Specifically, we can see that the models converge rapidly in Logistic, SVM, FCN, LSTM, and CNN orders, resulting from the complexity of each dataset as widely known in the ML literature. Moreover, in Fig. <a href="#S6.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ VI-B Discussion on the degree of non-IID ‣ VI Experimental analysis ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(b), FedDif outperforms the baseline FedAvg in the communication costs of every task. This is because FedDif can find suitable PUEs for each model to converge the model rapidly.</p>

For a fair comparison, we adopt the baselines of each study as CNN with CIFAR10, FCN with MNIST, and LSTM with FMNIST.

Compared to STC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, FedDif achieves better test accuracy at the minimum of 0.15% in LSTM and the maximum of 7.53% in CNN. However, several ML tasks of FedSwap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> tend to show slightly better performance than FedDif.

<p id="S6.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We compare the communication costs with the previous methods for the case of CNN with CIFAR10, as shown in Table <a href="#S7.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VII Conclusion and future works ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. We measure the communication costs until achieving the test accuracy of 80%. TT-HF is not available to compare communication efficiency because it cannot achieve the target accuracy by 100 communication rounds. We can see that FedDif reduces the number of consumed sub-frames by 28.56% compared to FedSwap and 2.85 folds compared to the baseline FL. Similarly, FedDif reduces the number of transmitted models by 42.67% compared to FedSwap and 2.67 folds compared to baseline FL. However, FedDif reduces the number of transmitted models by 3.03 folds compared to STC but consumes sub-frames by 10.82 folds more than STC. The reason is that STC transmits the compressed models, but STC does not consider the channel states in wireless networks. Note that STC can be utilized as an add-on for the FedDif. Meanwhile, FedSwap requires more sub-frames relatively because of the number of model transmissions as much as the full-diffusion in FedDif. In contrast, FedDif performs diffusion rounds by optimizing the decrement of diffusion efficiency so that it requires fewer sub-frames compared to the other methods. FedDif transmits fewer models per sub-frame because only part of PUEs send their models where the IID distance decreases. Consequently, FedDif is communication-efficient because it can achieve the target accuracy despite fewer sub-frames and models.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a novel diffusion strategy for preventing performance degradation by non-IID data in federated learning. We designed FedDif for the models to obtain knowledge of various local datasets before global aggregation. We regarded every user as non-IID batch data, and models can learn different non-IID data by passing through multiple users before the global aggregation step. Every model can obtain the same effect to be trained by the nearly IID dataset. Furthermore, based on auction theory, we empower communication efficiency in FedDif for the trade-off between improving learning performance and minimizing communication costs. Our study provides several research opportunities to study future works. For example, FedDif deals with the horizontal FL where the feature set of every dataset is the same. Considering vertical federated learning in which each user has a different feature set, the server aggregates the feature set is a crucial topic to tackle in future works.</p>

Note that the full diffusion is to participate all PUEs in the diffusion. In full diffusion, PUEs devouring substantial communication resources may exist because faraway PUEs can be paired to get any improvement of IID distance. We set the minimum tolerable QoS requirement to constraint consuming the excessive communication resources expressed as (<a href="#S3.E16.5" title="In 16 ‣ III-C Problem formulation ‣ III System model and problem formulation ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16e</span></a>). However, the isolation problem may occur when no neighboring PUE satisfies the minimum tolerable QoS. The models of the isolated PUEs may break the synchronization of FL or create an undertrained global model. This occurs in a similar issue to the insufficient batch data in centralized learning. Therefore, the higher value of the minimum tolerable QoS may deepen the isolation problem. In terms of consistency of the D2D communications, considering outage probability for PUE pairing is crucial.

AR of IID distance is computed utilizing the closed form of the IID distance for real-world DoL in (<a href="#S5.E36" title="In Lemma 2. ‣ Proof. ‣ Proposition 2. ‣ V Theoretical analysis ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">36</span></a>). We can see that the AR and ER of IID distance converge to zero as the diffusion rounds increase. We divide the universal dataset into ten non-IID datasets by Dirichlet distribution and distribute each non-IID dataset to PUEs. We can see that the IID distances converge in ten diffusion rounds because each model can learn the entire dataset when it learns ten pieces of the universal dataset, namely, ten types of non-IID datasets. In the case of diffusion efficiency, the entire trends are the same as in the case of IID distance. The diffusion efficiency and IID distance in the case of high concentration parameter <math id="A1.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha" display="inline"><semantics id="A1.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="A1.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="A1.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">α</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A1.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="A1.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝛼</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A1.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math>, which means a high degree of non-IID, steeply decrease comparing the low concentration parameter. This means that FedDif requires more diffusion rounds under a lower concentration parameter where the dataset is highly biased. Meanwhile, the diffusion mechanism entails the typical issues of existing machine learning, such as overshooting and gradient exploding. Overshooting and gradient exploding by the immoderate learning rate and upper bound of gradients may induce the weight divergence because <math id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\eta\mu/\left|\mathcal{P}_{K}^{(m)}\right|" display="inline"><semantics id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2a"><mrow id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml"><mrow id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.2" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.2.cmml">η</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.1" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.3" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.3.cmml">μ</mi></mrow><mo id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.2" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.cmml">/</mo><mrow id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.2.cmml"><mo id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.2.1.cmml">|</mo><msubsup id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.2" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.2.cmml">𝒫</mi><mi id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.3" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.3.cmml">K</mi><mrow id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.3" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.3.1" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml">m</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.3.2" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.3" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.2.1.cmml">|</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2b"><apply id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2"><divide id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.2"></divide><apply id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3"><times id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.1.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.1"></times><ci id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.2.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.2">𝜂</ci><ci id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.3.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.3">𝜇</ci></apply><apply id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.2.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1"><abs id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.2.1.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.2"></abs><apply id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.2">𝒫</ci><ci id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2.2.1.1.1.2.3">𝐾</ci></apply><ci id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1">𝑚</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A1.SS4.p1.2.m2.2c">\eta\mu/\left|\mathcal{P}_{K}^{(m)}\right|</annotation></semantics></math> can push up the upper bound of the weight difference.

However, diffusing more complex models can require more communication resources. We first investigate the performance of FedDif using the ResNet34 model, which has 600 times larger than our basic CNN model described in Fig. <a href="#A4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ D-C Scenario 3: large-scale neural networks and complex dataset ‣ Appendix D Additional experimental analysis ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.
In the case of the complex dataset, more classes may increase the complexity of the ML task because the model should distinguish samples in finer-grained scope. A finer-grained scope may confuse the model when the probabilities of multiple classes are similar to each other. To demonstrate FedDif using the complex dataset, we perform experiments using the ResNet34 model and CIFAR100. Note that the CIFAR100 dataset has ten times more classes than the CIFAR10 dataset as the following Fig. <a href="#A4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ D-C Scenario 3: large-scale neural networks and complex dataset ‣ Appendix D Additional experimental analysis ‣ Communication-Efficient Diffusion Strategy for Performance Improvement of Federated Learning with Non-IID Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.</p>

When there are a few neighboring PUEs in the range satisfying the minimum tolerable QoS, PUEs may continuously give and take the model for a specific PUE.

We can see that the learning performances of the two scenarios are similar, but the communication costs of the underlay mode are higher than the overlay mode. Although designing the optimal power control and resource allocation algorithms may improve the performance of FedDif utilizing the underlay mode of D2D communications, we focus on improving learning performance with non-IID data by increasing the diffusion rounds, and the resource allocation may be out of our scope.</p>
