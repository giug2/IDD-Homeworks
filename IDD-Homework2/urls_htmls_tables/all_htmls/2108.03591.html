<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), which usually utilizes machine learning methods and is effective in disaggregating smart meter readings from the household-level into appliance-level consumptions, can help to analyze electricity consumption behaviours of users and enable practical smart energy and smart grid applications. However, smart meters are privately owned and distributed, which make real-world applications of NILM challenging. To this end, this paper develops a distributed and privacy-preserving federated deep learning framework for NILM (FederatedNILM), which combines federated learning with a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture to conduct NILM for the classification of typical states of household appliances. Through extensive comparative experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed FederatedNILM framework is demonstrated.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of smart grids, smart meters have been increasingly installed, which provides enormous opportunities for various smart energy applications such as smart homes and demand response <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Smart meters can record high-resolution energy consumption data and therefore have great potential to provide useful insights into the energy use patterns from the individual household level to the grid level. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which usually utilizes machine learning in disaggregating smart meter readings from the household-level into appliance-level, is particularly useful for analyzing detailed energy consumption behaviours and enabling practical smart energy applications especially at the low-voltage level such as energy demand management and local energy trading.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing studies on NILM can be broadly categorized into supervised learning and unsupervised learning approaches. For the former, deep learning based models, which provide new opportunities for the electrical utility industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, are the most representative structures applied to NILM. The commonly adopted deep learning models include convolutional neural network (CNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and recurrent neural network (RNN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. For unsupervised learning, combinatorial optimization (CO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and clustering analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> are commonly used for NILM. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> compared unsupervised learning (CO, FHMM) with supervised learning (CNN) for NILM where results showed that the CNN-based model performed better than unsupervised models. Although deep learning models usually perform well on NILM, such models still face several challenges:</p>

<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The number of the labelled data generated by a single household is limited, and the size of the training set has a great impact on the effectiveness of the deep learning model. Therefore, it is necessary to collect the labelled data from multiple data sources on the premise of ensuring data security.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different users have different lifestyles and thus have different electricity usage patterns (i.e. data distribution), which put forward higher requirements for the generalization ability of the NILM model.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the increasing public attention to data privacy and security preservation, it is necessary to satisfy the needs of training models with not only high precision but also reasonable communication efficiency under the premise of ensuring individual data privacy.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the above challenges, federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> was proposed where private data of individual users do not need to be uploaded to a central server for centralized training. Instead, under the coordination of the central cloud server, each participant can carry out the model training locally and only exchange typical parameters of their local model such as updated gradients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Compared with other privacy-preserving technologies that need to encrypt the original data set, federated learning does not need to collect the original data centrally, therefore model training in this framework does not involve data transmission and public sharing, and can thus help to achieve individual data privacy protection. On the other hand, the wide penetration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in various areas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> has sparked new opportunities for federated learning by providing massive amounts of distributed user-generated data on intelligent IoT devices and applications, which is poised to make substantial contributions in all aspects of our modern life, such as smart healthcare and smart grid system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although federated learning, as a newly proposed distributed and privacy-preserving framework, has been studied in various areas, limited attention has been paid to smart grid applications especially for NILM. Since NILM is one of the key technologies to unlock the full potential of local and distributed energy resources, a distributed and privacy-preserving framework is urgently needed to enable its practical applications. To this end, this paper develops a distributed and privacy-preserving federated deep learning framework for NILM (FederatedNILM). The main contributions of this paper are summarised as follows.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing research shows that the analysis of real-time data may expose user’s privacy information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Many studies designed privacy protection schemes for NILM, which can be mainly divided into identity privacy and data privacy protection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Identity privacy protection refers to implement user identity recognition while hiding the real ID of the users by special mechanisms such as blind signature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> adopted blind signature to protect the identity privacy of smart meter users. In the proposed scheme, the power company has access to real-time electricity data but does not know the identity of owners so the privacies of users are protected.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Data privacy protection, on the other hand, is usually achieved by adding noises or encryptions to electricity consumption data. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> suggested that the load signatures of appliances in individual households could be moderated by home electrical power routing. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> studied the sensitive data in smart metering from an information-theoretic perspective. In the paper, the smart meter readings were diversified by the alternative energy source and the real consumption data were filtered by the storage units. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a fog computing approach based on differential privacy against NILM, which adds noises to the behaviour parameter derived from the FHMM rather than the original consumption data. The proposed scheme achieved a satisfying trade-off between data utility and privacy. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> compared four variants of differential privacy in blockchain-based smart metering, and the experiment showed that such mechanisms could provide an effective privacy-preserving scheme.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When data owners intend to combine their local data to train a deep neural network model, the traditional way is to integrate their individual data into the central server and use the integrated data to train a standard centralized model. However, the data uploading and integration process often involves legal issues such as data privacy and security. Therefore federated learning was introduced to overcome the problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As described in the figure, at step 1, each client (i.e. each household) uses its local private data to train the local model and update its local parameters during each training round. Then, each client passes the updated parameters to a central cloud server. At step 2, the global model aggregates the updated parameters from all local clients and updates its own parameters accordingly in the central cloud server. Subsequently, the updated global model parameters are broadcast to each local client at step 3. The process is iterated for multiple rounds until convergence.</p>

After going through a convolutional layer, the feature dimension of the input is reduced to a quarter of its original size, and the acquired feature maps were upsampled to increase their size to the size of the input time signals. Then the upsampled feature maps (shallow features) are concatenated with the original input signal (deep features) from the temporal pooling to get the final feature maps.

Firstly, experimental settings including the environment setup, data preprocessing, training and testing split, and the evaluation metrics are introduced. Secondly, we compare our proposed FederatedNILM with the centralized counterpart in terms of model performance and training time efficiency. Finally, we compare adopted deep learning architecture (used in the FederatedNILM and the centralized counterpart) with several existing advanced NILM models to evaluate the performance of the proposed FederatedNILM framework.</p>

It is worth pointing out that the fridge consumes relatively low power compared with other appliances and is likely to be learned with less evident signature during model training since its consumption can easily be omitted as unidentified load noise. This might explain why testing results of the fridge show relatively low scores compared with other appliances.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In general, the deep neural network-based models for NILM have relatively better performance than other models. It is also worth pointing out that both the Centralized-NILM and FederatedNILM achieved better testing results on the unseen house 2 (see Tables <a href="#S5.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ 5.2.4 Performance comparison with state-of-the-arts ‣ 5.2 Comparative studies ‣ 5 Performance evaluation ‣ FederatedNILM: A Distributed and Privacy-preserving Framework for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring based on Federated Deep Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> and <a href="#S5.T10" title="Table 10 ‣ 5.2.4 Performance comparison with state-of-the-arts ‣ 5.2 Comparative studies ‣ 5 Performance evaluation ‣ FederatedNILM: A Distributed and Privacy-preserving Framework for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring based on Federated Deep Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>) than the average testing results of all three cases in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1.3 Training and testing ‣ 5.1 Experimental settings ‣ 5 Performance evaluation ‣ FederatedNILM: A Distributed and Privacy-preserving Framework for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring based on Federated Deep Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> for the washing machine. One possible reason is that house 1 provides the largest dataset, and when this house is considered as an unseen house as in Table <a href="#S5.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 5.1.3 Training and testing ‣ 5.1 Experimental settings ‣ 5 Performance evaluation ‣ FederatedNILM: A Distributed and Privacy-preserving Framework for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring based on Federated Deep Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the training size of the model becomes much smaller, which could impact the model performance. Among all the methods, the Centralized-NILM model achieved the highest accuracy score for both appliances, which proves that the deep learning architecture we utilized in this paper could enhance the local training performance and thus improve the overall state inference accuracy in our framework. As already discussed in previous subsections, the above results also demonstrated that our proposed FederatedNILM with the same deep learning architecture as in Centralized-NILM could achieve promising generalization performance. Considering FederatedNILM works in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner, which is fundamentally different from the other considered methods (i.e. centralized based methods), our proposed framework could achieve a good trade-off between data privacy protection and data utility.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a distributed and privacy-preserving framework based on federated learning for NILM (FederatedNILM) to classify the typical states of appliances on the household level. The proposed FederatedNILM combines federated learning with a novel deep neural network model, which could benefit from labelled data of multiple distributed user data sources for NILM. More importantly, compared with the standard centralized model, the framework only requires model parameters uploading instead of data transmitting, which has good capability for data privacy protection. Comparative experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and good performance of the proposed distributed and privacy-preserving framework as well as the superior model performance of the adopted deep learning architecture for NILM.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although our proposed FederatedNILM achieved satisfactory results for most of the cases, its average disaggregation performance on the washing machine for the unseen house case still needs to be improved. The same situation has been found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Therefore, in our future work, we will explore to further improve the NILM generalization model performance for particular appliances with more complicated characteristics. In addition, how to further optimize our FederatedNILM framework to enhance its privacy-preserving level with minimal reduction of data utility is another future research direction that is worth exploring.</p>
