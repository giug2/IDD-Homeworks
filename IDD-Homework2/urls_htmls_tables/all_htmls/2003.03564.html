<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Learning over massive data stored in different locations is essential in many real-world applications. However, sharing data is full of challenges due to the increasing demands of privacy and security with the growing use of smart mobile devices and IoT devices. Federated learning provides a potential solution to privacy-preserving and secure machine learning, by means of jointly training a global model without uploading data distributed on multiple devices to a central server. However, most existing work on federated learning adopts machine learning models with full-precision weights, and almost all these models contain a large number of redundant parameters that do not need to be transmitted to the server, consuming an excessive amount of communication costs. To address this issue, we propose a federated trained ternary quantization (FTTQ) algorithm, which optimizes the quantized networks on the clients through a self-learning quantization factor. Theoretical proofs of the convergence of quantization factors, unbiasedness of FTTQ, as well as a reduced weight divergence are given. On the basis of FTTQ, we propose a ternary federated averaging protocol (T-FedAvg) to reduce the upstream and downstream communication of federated learning systems. Empirical experiments are conducted to train widely used deep learning models on publicly available datasets, and our results demonstrate that the proposed T-FedAvg is effective in reducing communication costs and can even achieve slightly better performance on non-IID data in contrast to the canonical federated learning algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The number of Internet of Things (IoTs) and deployed smart mobile devices in factories has dramatically grown over the past decades, generating massive amounts of data stored distributively every moment. Meanwhile, recent achievements in deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, such as AlphaGo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, rely heavily on the knowledge stored in big data. Naturally, the utilization of the vast amounts of data stored in decentralized client devices will significantly benefit human life and industrial production. However, training deep learning models using distributed data is challenging, and uploading private data to the cloud is controversial, due to limited network bandwidths, limited computational resources and regulations on security and privacy preservation, e.g., the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many research efforts have been devoted to distributed machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which focuses on model training on multiple machines to alleviate the computational burden caused by large data volumes. These methods have achieved promising performance by splitting big data into smaller sets, partitioning models or sharing updates of the model to accelerate the training process with the help of data parallelism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, model parallelism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and parameter server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, among others. Correspondingly, weights optimization strategies for multiple machines have also been proposed. For example, Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> introduce asynchronous mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm (ASGD) on multi-GPU devices for deep neural networks (DNNs) training and achieved more than three times speedup on four GPUs than on a single one without loss of precision. Distributed machine learning algorithms for multiple data centers located in different regions have been studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, little attention has been paid to the data security and the impact of data distribution on the performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To protect data security and privacy while training models on distributed devices, an interesting framework for training a global model while storing the private data locally, known as federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, has been proposed. This approach makes it possible to extract knowledge from data distributed on local devices without uploading private data to a server. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Ternary Compression for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> illustrates a simplified workflow and an application scenario in the process industry. Several extensions have been introduced to the standard federated learning system. Zhao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> have observed weight divergence caused by extreme data distributions and proposed a method of sharing a small amount of data with other clients to enhance the performance of federated learning algorithms. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> have proposed an adaptive federated learning system under a given computational budget based on a control algorithm that balances the client update and global aggregation, and analyzed the convergence bound of the distributed gradient descent. Recent comprehensive overviews of federated learning can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, and design ideas, challenges and future research directions of federated learning on massively mobile devices are presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

This is due to the needed massive communication costs for uploading and downloading, and the average upload and download speeds are asymmetric, e.g., the mean mobile download speed is 26.36 Mbps while the upload speed is 11.05 Mbps in Q3-Q4 2017 in the UK <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Clearly, high communication costs is one of the main reasons hindering distributed and federated training. Although the research on model compression was originally not meant to reduce the communication costs, it has become a source of inspiration for communication-efficient distributed learning. Neural network pruning is an early method for model compression proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.

A multi-objective evolutionary federated learning framework is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, which aims to simultaneously maximize the learning performance and minimize the model complexity to reduce communication costs. Lu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> significantly enhance the communication efficiency by uploading significant updates of the local models only. Recently, an layer-wise asynchronous model update approach has been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> to reduce the number of the parameters to be transmitted.</p>

However, since STC is a model compression method after local training is completed, the quantization process is not optimized during the training.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, most existing federated learning methods emphasize on the application of full-precision models or streamline the models after the training procedure on the clients is completed, rather than simplifying the model during the training. Therefore, deploying federated learning in real-world systems such as the widely used IoT devices in the process industry is somehow difficult. To address this issue, we focus on model compression on clients during the training to reduce the required computational resources at the inference stage and the communication costs of federated learning. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p>

This is done by mapping the parameters in a continuous space to a quantization discrete space, which can greatly reduce model redundancy and save memory overhead.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we first propose a federated trained ternary quantization (FTTQ for short) to reduce the energy consumption (computational resources) required for each client during inference and the upstream and downstream communication costs.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One challenge remains when threshold-based quantization is to be implemented in a federated learning system: Since the sparsity of the quantized local models may greatly differ from client to client, the global model will be biased towards the local model having the maximum weight range, if the same threshold is used for all clients. To address this issue, we start by normalizing the weights to [-1, 1]:</p>

Consequently, FTTQ significantly reduces the size of the updates transmitted to the server, thus reducing the costs of upstream communications. However, the costs of the downstream communications will not be reduced if no additional measures are taken, since the weights of the global model becomes real-values again after aggregation. To address this issue, a ternary federated learning protocol is presented in the next subsection.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">By quantizing the local and global models, our method is able to reduce communications in both upload and download phases, which brings a major advantage when deploying DNNs for resource-constrained devices. The difference between Strategy I and Strategy II lies in the downstream communication costs, and Strategy I is more communication-efficient. According to our experiments, we observed that the server has implemented Strategy I all the time when MLP is adopted as the learning model. Specifically, the clients quantize the local 32-bits full-precision networks to 2-bit quantized models and push the 2-bit network weights and the quantization factor to the server, and then download the quantized global model from the server at the end. For example, if we configure a federated learning environment involving 20 clients and a global model that requires 25 Mb of storage space, the total communication costs of the standard federated learning is about 1 Gb per round (upload and download). By contrast, our method reduces the costs to 65 Mb per round (upload and download), which is about 1/16 of the standard method. The overall workflow of the proposed ternary federated protocol is summarized in Algorithm <a href="#alg2" title="In III-B2 Downstream ‣ III-B Ternary Federated Averaging ‣ III Proposed Algorithm ‣ Ternary Compression for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is found that Strategy II is not used by the server when training MLP, hence the communication costs of T-FedAvg are reduced by 88% in the upload and download phases compared to the standard FedAvg. When training CNN, the uploaded communication costs of T-FedAvg are reduced to 13%, and the download communication costs are 82% of FedAvg and CMFL, which means that the server implements Strategy II for several times to maintain the performance. Similarly, T-FedAvg compresses nearly 94% of the upstream, 25% of the downstream communications, and outperforms CMFL when training ResNet<sup id="S5.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_sup">∗</sup>.

From the table, we see that MLP using centralized learning achieves an accuracy of 92.25%. By contrast, MLP using CMFL and T-FedAvg achieve 90.91% and 91.95%, respectively, both outperforming FedAvg although slightly underperformed by the baseline mode. This may be attributed to the fact that much less data is involved in training in the federated learning frameworks than in the baseline, since the participation ratio is set to 0.1. It is interesting that the quantized T-FedAvg outperforms FedAvg, and one possible reason is that the ternary layer may play the role of weight regularization in MLP.</p>

The test accuracy of CMFL on CIFAR10 is not as good as expected, which may be affected by the reduction in communication costs. Generally speaking, T-FedAvg underperforms FedAvg under a limited weight width, which is known as the quantization error. However, the model size of the ternary part in the global and local models of T-FedAvg is only 1/16 compared to the full-precision models, and CMFL reduces a large number of communication rounds. Thus we consider that both methods have achieved satisfying performance in the federated learning framework.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To take a closer look at the performance of the four algorithms under comparison, we also plot the convergence curves in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-B Results on IID Data ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Ternary Compression for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. From these results, we find that T-FedAvg converges faster than CMFL in all test instances, although FedAvg converges slightly faster than T-FedAvg when CNN is trained on CIFAR10. However, it is clear to see that T-FedAvg converges the fastest over the bits upload among the three federated learning frameworks in the three instances. This can be attributed to the fact that FTTQ optimizes the quantized network based on the full-precision model during the training process. Finally, it is noted that the federated learning methods converge more slowly than the centralized learning algorithm.</p>

<p id="S5.SS6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As we can see, when training MLP, the elapsed time of T-FedAvg is almost the same as FedAvg and is much less than CMFL. However, as the depth of global model increases, the time complexity of our algorithm will increase significantly. Indeed, this will be a potential limitation of model quantization when the model becomes deeper, despite that the proposed method has already reduced a large number of quantization factors. In the future, we will work out solutions to reduce the time complexity of T-FedAvg, for example, by implementing quantization only on the last local epoch.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is effective in privacy preservation, although it is constrained by limited upstream and downstream bandwidths and the performance may seriously degrade when the data distribution is non-IID. To address these issues, we have proposed federated trained ternary quantization (FTTQ), a compression method adjusted for federated learning based on TTQ algorithm, to reduce the energy consumption at the inference stage on the clients. Furthermore, we have proposed ternary federated learning protocol, which compress both uploading and downloading communications. Detailed theoretic proofs of the unbiasedness of quantization, and reduction of weight divergence. Our experimental results on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Moreover, since we have reduced the downstream and upstream communication costs between the clients and server, we can increase the number of clients or the rounds of communications within the same constraint of budgets to improve the performance of federated learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our approach can be seen as an application of trained ternary quantization method by quantizing the local and global model to reduce the communication costs. However, the reduction in communication costs is at the expense of increased computational costs on the clients, in particular when the model becomes very deep. Our future work will aim at finding more efficient approaches to improving the performance of federated learning on non-IID data and more efficient encoding strategies for quantization.
