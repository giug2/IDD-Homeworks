<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Client selection significantly affects the system convergence efficiency and is a crucial problem in federated learning. Existing methods often select clients by evaluating each round individually and overlook the necessity for long-term optimization, resulting in suboptimal performance and potential fairness issues. In this study, we propose a novel client selection strategy designed to emulate the performance achieved with full client participation. In a single round, we select clients by minimizing the gradient-space estimation error between the client subset and the full client set. In multi-round selection, we introduce a novel individual fairness constraint, which ensures that clients with similar data distributions have similar frequencies of being selected. This constraint guides the client selection process from a long-term perspective. We employ Lyapunov optimization and submodular functions to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients, and provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence ability. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves both accuracy and fairness compared to previous methods while also exhibiting efficiency by incurring minimal time overhead.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training without the necessity of sharing local data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and is widely used in various domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
In FL, model parameters or gradient updates are frequently exchanged between the central server and participating clients, leading to substantial communication overhead. To address the challenge posed by the limited bandwidth, a common approach is to select a subset of clients for local training, which reduces the communication costs compared with involving all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. However, in heterogeneous scenarios, different selection strategies lead to distinct optimization trajectories, and an improper client selection strategy can cause the optimization trajectory to deviate seriously from the optimal one, significantly hindering the model performance.
Therefore, a critical challenge is to develop an effective client selection strategy that reduces the communication overhead while ensuring model convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In most cases, the global models generated by full client participation are considered the gold standard or benchmark. This is because they represent models trained on the entire dataset available across all clients, offering a comprehensive reference point for evaluating model performance. Building upon this understanding, we propose an intuitive strategy where clients are selected in a manner that ensures the optimization trajectory closely resembles that achieved with full client participation over the long term. We refer to this strategy as the long-term client selection strategy. This strategy yields two key advantages. First, by emulating the optimization trajectory of full client participation, it aims to achieve comparable performance. Moreover, it reduces communication overhead by involving only a subset of clients in the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our Goal.</span> In this work, we investigate the three questions: 1) what principles should be followed to implement this strategy; 2) how to mathematically formulate this strategy and provide a fast solution; and 3) is this strategy more effective than existing methods? To answer the first question, we propose two crucial principles to be followed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Principle I</span>: <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">In each round, the data distribution generated by the selected subset of clients should closely resemble the data distribution of the full client participation</em>. For example, in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a), clients collaboratively train an image classification model, where each client has images of only one kind of animal, and three clusters exist in their data distributions. Due to limited bandwidth, the server is required only to select three clients in each round. In this case, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b), the ideal strategy is to select one client from each cluster instead of three clients from the same cluster. This ensures that the data distribution resulting from the subset of selected clients serves as a reliable estimation of that from the full set of clients. However, in real-world applications, the clustering pattern in data distributions may be unknown or non-existent. Therefore, the key challenge here is to determine the subset of clients that best approximates the full client set without imposing extensive assumptions on their data distributions.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, if only Principle I is followed and client selection is performed by evaluating each round individually, there is a risk that the same subset of clients may be consistently selected across multiple rounds, while others may have minimal opportunities for selection. This phenomenon is indeed observed in our experimental results.
In such cases, the system may accurately predict outcomes for frequently selected clients but makes inaccurate or biased predictions for those rarely selected, resulting in degradation of the global model’s performance and ineffective convergence. Furthermore, these seldom-selected clients may perceive unfair treatment and lose motivation to participate, ultimately endangering the sustainability of the federated system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate this problem, we propose Principle II, which guides client selection across multiple rounds from a long-term perspective. <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Principle II</span>: <em id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">In multi-round selection, clients with similar data distributions should have similar frequencies of being selected.</em> For example, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, clients 1, 2, and 3 should share similar selection frequencies, as should clients 4 and 5, while the frequencies for clients 1 and 4 may differ. This principle aligns with the concept of individual fairness (IF) in central machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which posits that similar instances or individuals in a dataset should yield similar predictions or outcomes. In our work, we refer to this principle as the individual fairness constraint. Here, the key challenge is to quantify the similarity between clients in terms of data distribution and selection frequency, respectively, and further formulate individual fairness mathematically.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">This proposed individual fairness offers two key benefits. First, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (c), it promotes the diversity of selected clients across multiple rounds and reduces model prediction bias. Furthermore, existing fair federated learning approaches often utilize a uniform sampling constraint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> to ensure similar selection probabilities for all clients. However, this uniform approach may compromise selection performance, as it disregards the heterogeneous data distribution among clients. In contrast, our proposed fairness constraint specifically targets clients with similar data distributions. Thus, it allows for varying selection frequencies among clients with heterogeneous data distributions, such as clients 1 and 4 in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. This flexibility enables the individual constraint to accommodate the data heterogeneity without compromising selection performance in single rounds.</p>

<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limitation of Prior Works.</span> To address the client selection problem, a common approach is the random selection strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Recent works have proposed various improvements, including contribution-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, loss-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and cluster-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, these methods typically evaluate each round individually and fail to select clients from a long-term perspective, potentially leading to model biases and fairness issues. Additionally, the clustering pattern in data distributions may be unknown or non-existent, making the application of cluster-based methods challenging. Furthermore, fair federated learning has discussed collaborative fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, group fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and performance fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, where performance fairness aligns most closely with our objectives. Existing fair federated learning approaches often utilize a uniform sampling constraint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> to ensure similar selection probabilities for all clients. However, it disregards the heterogeneous data distribution among clients and requires their selection probabilities to be uniformly similar. This may hinder the identification of the optimal subset of clients that best approximates the full set of clients.</p>

<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose a novel long-term client selection strategy in federated learning (<em id="S1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">LongFed</em>), designed to emulate the model performance achieved with full client participation. In a single round, we perform client selection by minimizing the estimation error between a representative subset of clients and the full set of clients. In multi-round selection, we propose a novel individual fairness constraint to promote the diversity of selected clients without compromising selection performance in single rounds. Subsequently, we formulate the client selection problem as a time-averaged optimization function and simplify it using Lyapunov optimization from control theory. In addition, leveraging the submodular nature of the optimization function, we propose a fast greedy algorithm to find the optimal subset of clients in each round. The convergence of the proposed strategy is also analyzed. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the proposed <em id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">LongFed</em> strategy. First, the proposed strategy effectively guides the system to converge along a trajectory similar to that of full client participation. Second, it outperforms prior works in terms of both accuracy and fairness. Last, the proposed strategy introduces minimal time overhead compared to the random selection strategy.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In vanilla federated learning systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the random selection strategy is commonly employed to choose clients. Recent works have proposed various improvements, including contribution-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, loss-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and cluster-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The first type focuses on evaluating client contributions, where clients with higher contributions are assigned higher selection probabilities. One commonly used metric is the local data size, and clients with larger datasets are considered to have higher contributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Another approach involves employing the Shapley value <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> from game theory, which calculates the average marginal model improvement of each client over all possible coalitions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Clients that result in larger model performance improvements are regarded as making larger contributions and are assigned higher probabilities of selection. Additionally, some methods evaluate the similarity between the local model at each client and the aggregated global model at the server. Clients with higher similarities are considered to bring little improvement to the global model and are thus assigned lower selection probabilities in subsequent training epochs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second type involves selecting clients based on their training losses. These methods consider that clients with higher training losses may struggle to effectively fit their local data. As a result, they assign higher selection probabilities or weights to these clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. FedCor is a representative work in loss-based approaches that employs Gaussian processes to model the loss correlations between clients and selects clients with a substantial reduction in expected global loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, recognizing that clients may contain similar and redundant information, a diverse strategy is proposed to choose a subset of clients that can best represent the full client set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The third approach involves a cluster-based strategy. Recognizing that clients may have different data distributions or have their own learning tasks, these clustering-based approaches divide the clients into several clusters. Clients within the same cluster exhibit similar data distributions, whereas those in different clusters may display significant variations in their data distributions. In aggregation, the server randomly selects a client from each cluster. In this cluster-based paradigm, FedCG leverages a graph neural network to capture gradient sharing across multiple clusters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Moreover, IFCA addresses the cluster identification problem by determining the cluster membership of each client and optimizes each of the cluster models in a federated learning framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, most of these methods select clients by evaluating each round individually, thus failing to optimize a series of client subsets from a long-term perspective. These limitations could cause potential model biases and fairness issues, ultimately resulting in lower convergence efficiency. Furthermore, if the clustering pattern among clients is known, the long-term client selection problem becomes straightforward: simply selecting one client randomly from each cluster in every communication round <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. However, in practical scenarios, the clustering pattern is usually unknown or, in some cases, does not exist. This limitation renders cluster-based methods ineffective for solving the long-term client selection problem.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are three types of fairness in federated learning: collaborative fairness, group fairness, and performance fairness. Collaborative fairness emphasizes that clients who make larger contributions should be rewarded with correspondingly larger rewards, and the assessment of client contributions is a key challenge. Client contribution evaluation methods have been discussed in Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="II-A Client Selection in Federated Learning ‣ II Related Work ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">II-A</span></span></a> in the context of contribution-based client selection methods.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Group fairness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, also known as algorithmic fairness, emphasizes that model outputs should not unfairly discriminate against vulnerable or underrepresented groups, such as minorities, women, or the aged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. FairFed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> serves as one of the representative works of addressing this concern. In FairFed, both global fairness metrics at the server and local fairness metrics at each client are defined. These metrics assess disparities in opportunities among different groups. FairFed then dynamically adjusts aggregation weights at each round based on the discrepancies between global and local fairness metrics, which effectively mitigates the biases towards sensitive attributes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Performance fairness refers that the model should produce similar performance across all clients, where the uniformity of performance is commonly used as the metric for evaluation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Various approaches have emerged to achieve performance fairness. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, fairness is defined by assigning uniform weight to each client and introduced as an additional constraint in the optimization function. Besides, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> identifies a trade-off between model robustness and fairness, and proposes a personalized framework to inherently achieve both fairness and robustness benefits. Moreover, several works study the fairness issue by considering that the probability of being selected is similar for all clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, the three types of fairness described above cannot effectively address the fairness issue outlined in Principle II. While collaborative fairness and group fairness focus on different aspects compared to our work, performance fairness aligns most closely with our objectives. In these works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the uniform sampling method ensures a similar probability of being selected for all clients. However, we argue that it is unsuitable for achieving the long-term client selection strategy. This is because the uniform sampling method disregards the heterogeneous data distribution among clients. Consequently, it may hinder the identification of the optimal subset of clients that best approximates the data distribution of full client participation.</p>

The data coreset involves selecting a weighted small sample of training data to approximate the gradient of the whole training data set. It is important to highlight that data coreset is commonly employed to enhance training efficiency in centralized machine learning scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, while our focus is on optimizing client selection to reduce communication bandwidth in decentralized and federated scenarios. Moreover, data coreset is typically utilized for a one-time data selection process, while client selection in federated learning is a long-term process carried out across multiple rounds. The long-term optimization nature introduces new challenges, such as fairness issues and potential model biases introduced in Section <a href="#S1" title="I Introduction ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>.</p>

The main idea behind Lyapunov optimization is to break down the long-term time-averaged constraints in the optimization problem into constraints that can be adhered to in each communication round. This allows us to optimize the objective function directly in each round without violating the constraints specific to that round.
Furthermore, by ensuring that these constraints are adhered to in each round, we can automatically achieve compliance with the long-term time-averaged constraints at the end of the <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> round.

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Lyapunov optimization typically involves three steps <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. First, a virtual queue is defined for each time-averaged constraint. This step converts the time-averaged constraints into stability constraints for virtual queues. Second, a Lyapunov function is defined based on virtual queues, and the Lyapunov drift is introduced. This step breaks down the time-averaged constraints into requirements for Lyapunov drift in each communication round. Finally, the Lyapunov drift is integrated into the optimization objective, allowing us to minimize both the Lyapunov drift and the optimization objective simultaneously. In the following, we illustrate how to transform problem P1 using these three steps.</p>

Specifically, for the FMNIST dataset, we utilize a multilayer perception (MLP) with two hidden layers as the global model. For CIFAR-10, our global model adopts a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture consisting of three convolutional layers, with the outputs of these layers fed into an MLP layer.

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.2" class="ltx_p">First, examining the time solely for client selection, our proposed method exhibits only a marginal increase (less than 0.4ms) compared to existing methods. This increment is acceptable in most real applications. In addition, the time required for client selection (about 0.5ms) is almost negligible compared to the total time required to complete a communication round (about 2000ms). This highlights that the majority of time is allocated to local updates within clients. Second, examining the time required to complete a round, our proposed strategy imposes only a modest additional computational time (about 400 ms) compared to existing approaches.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our work, we introduce a novel long-term client selection approach for federated learning, aiming to emulate the optimization trajectory achieved by full client participation. We establish two guiding principles to steer the client selection process effectively. We formulate the client selection problem as a long-term optimization task, where the objective is to minimize the estimation error in gradient space between the selected subset of clients and the full client set. Besides, we impose the individual fairness constraint to ensure similar selection frequencies among clients with similar data distributions. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization techniques from control theory, we transform this problem and propose a greedy algorithm to find solutions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy closely approximates the performance achieved under full client participation, with significant improvements over previous methods in terms of both accuracy and fairness. Additionally, our method exhibits efficiency by incurring minimal time overhead, which is often negligible when compared to local training duration.</p>

<p id="S9.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The visualization results in Fig. <a href="#S9.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IX-B Visualization of Client Selection Strategy ‣ IX Additional Details of Experiment ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> for the FMNIST dataset under the Dir scenario are similar to the 2SPC scenario. Specifically, in Fig. <a href="#S9.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IX-B Visualization of Client Selection Strategy ‣ IX Additional Details of Experiment ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> (b)-(d), the circles around selected clients for baseline methods often overlap and cover only a minority of clients. Moreover, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S9.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IX-B Visualization of Client Selection Strategy ‣ IX Additional Details of Experiment ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> (e), the clients selected by our proposed method effectively cover the majority of remaining clients. Additionally, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S9.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IX-B Visualization of Client Selection Strategy ‣ IX Additional Details of Experiment ‣ Emulating Full Client Participation: A Long-Term Client Selection Strategy for Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> (f), the strategy selects different clients in different rounds, adhering to the fairness constraint.</p>
