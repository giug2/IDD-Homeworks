<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is a distributed learning setting where the main aim is to train machine learning models without having to share raw data but only what is required for learning. To guarantee training data privacy and high-utility models, differential privacy and secure aggregation techniques are often combined with federated learning. However, with fine-grained protection granularities the currently existing techniques require the parties to communicate for each local optimisation step, if they want to fully benefit from the secure aggregation in terms of the resulting formal privacy guarantees. In this paper, we show how a simple new analysis allows the parties to perform multiple local optimisation steps while still benefiting from joint noise scaling when using secure aggregation. We show that our analysis enables higher utility models with guaranteed privacy protection under limited number of communication rounds.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> is a common distributed learning setting, where a central server and several clients holding their own local data sets collaborate to learn a single global model. The main feature in FL is that the clients do not directly communicate data, but only what is required for learning, e.g., gradients or updated model parameters (pseudo-gradients).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While FL satisfies the data minimization principle, i.e., only what is actually needed is communicated while the actual raw data never leaves the client, it does not protect against privacy attacks such as membership inference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> or reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.
Instead, training data privacy is commonly ensured by combining differential privacy (DP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>), a formal privacy definition, and secure multiparty computation (MPC), <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> with FL (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">DP is essentially a robustness guarantee for stochastic algorithms, which guarantees that small perturbations to the inputs have small effects on the algorithms’ output probabilities. What constitutes a small perturbation depends on the chosen protection granularity: the same basic DP definition can be used for ensuring privacy on anything from single sample to entire data set level.
In turn, MPC protocols can be used to limit the amount of information an adversary has about computations. In FL, secure aggregation (SecAgg) protocols, a specialised form of secure computation that requires significantly less resources than general MPC, are commonly used for communicating model updates from the clients to the server, which can result in provably better joint DP guarantees than is possible to achieve by any single client in isolation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Under the general FL setup, two main alternatives are commonly considered: cross-device FL and cross-silo FL. In cross-device FL, each client is assumed to have a small local data set, while the total number of clients is large, e.g., thousands or millions. In the cross-silo case, the total number of clients is small, for example, a dozen, but each client is assumed to have a larger local data set.
In this paper, our running example is standard cross-silo differentially private FL (DPFL) where the clients communicate all updates to the server using SecAgg.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Instead of considering any specific SecAgg implementation, in this work we mostly assume an idealised trusted aggregator.</span></span></span>
In this setting, the most useful DP protection granularity is typically something strictly more fine-grained than client-level: when clients are, e.g., different hospitals or banks, there are typically several individuals in a single clients’ local data set and the protection granularity needs to match the use case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">While client-level granularity in DPFL is, at least in principle, straightforward to combine with SecAgg, more fine-grained granularities present a problem: using existing techniques one has to choose between i) having joint DP guarantees with less noise due to SecAgg but with all clients using only a single local optimisation step per FL round, and ii) having more noisy local DP (LDP) guarantees that do not formally benefit from SecAgg while allowing the clients to do more local optimisation steps per FL round.
Both of these options have significant drawbacks: the amount of server-client communications is typically one of the first bottlenecks that limit model training in FL, while LDP guarantees regularly require noise levels that heavily affect the resulting model utility. In this paper we show that this trade-off is not unavoidable but can be largely remedied by a simple new analysis of the problem.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There is a significant amount of existing work focusing on the general problem of combining DP with FL, although the focus has mostly been on the cross-device FL setting with user-level DP. To the best of our knowledge, while the combination of DPFL with SecAgg is certainly not novel (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>), there is no existing work on the privacy analysis when the clients do multiple local optimisation steps fine-grained sample-level DP granularity and communicate the results via SecAgg.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>Note that <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, Algorithm 4]</cite> seem to state a weaker, specialised version of our results, i.e., they use several local optimisation steps with sample-level DP and SecAgg in FL, while scaling the noise jointly over the clients. However, as noted in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>,
the approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> would require a separate proof of privacy beyond what is actually provided in the paper.</span></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the existing work in more detail, we can distinguish several main lines of research.
There are many papers proposing novel learning methods for FL, assuming sample-level DP and joint noise scaling with SecAgg. While the existing work only uses a single local optimisation step (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>), our analysis can be utilised in this setting to enable multiple local steps generally for many such methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another clear line of work has focused on introducing novel discrete DP mechanisms that can be used with additively homomorphic encryption techniques, which typically operate on the group of integers with modulo additions.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposed a binomial mechanism that provides DP using discrete binomial noise. Improving on the binomial mechanism, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed a discrete Gaussian mechanism, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> introduced a Skellam mechanism and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> a Poisson-binomial mechanism, both of which improve on the discrete Gaussian, e.g., by being infinitely divisible distributions: the sum of Skellam/Poisson-binomial distributed random variables is another Skellam/Poisson-binomial random variable. Our work is not focused on introducing new DP mechanisms, but our analysis allows for using many different DP noise mechanism. In particular, our analysis allows for joint noise scaling under SecAgg including when using infinitely divisible DP mechanisms, such as the Skellam mechanism, with pseudo-gradients and fine-grained DP protection level.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">One theme that has seen much recent activity is the combination of DPFL with quantization techniques to minimize the amount of bits communicated by the clients.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> combined quantisation with the binomial mechanism,
while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> used discrete Gaussian with randomised rounding for DPFL, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> did the same with the Skellam mechanism. Again, one main motivation stated for introducing the Poisson-binomial mechanism <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is that it requires the clients to communicate less bits as the privacy gets tighter, contrary to what happens, e.g., with the discrete Gaussian mechanism.
Furthermore, in the tight communication budget regime, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed stochastic DP sign-SGD, which provides LDP guarantees and communicates 1 bit per client gradient dimension.
In the same vein, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed the Minimum Variance Unbiased (MVU) mechanism for combining DPFL and heavy compression, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> introduced Interpolated MVU (I-MVU), that improves on MVU for DPFL especially in the case of high-dimensional data by relaxing the requirement of unbiasedness. While in principle it is possible to combine our analysis with quantisation techniques which are compatible with SecAgg, since the model updates in our case are pseudo-gradients and not gradients, this is not entirely straightforward.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another alternative approach to improve communication-efficiency of DPFL is to compress the updates directly instead of or in addition to quantising them. On this front, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> introduced an approach based on relative entropy coding, where the DP guarantees are derived based on the inherent randomness of the compression method without needing any additional DP noise mechanism. However, their approach does not support using SecAgg for joint noise scaling but results in LDP guarantees, and so is not directly compatible with our approach. Finally,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposed and analysed a linear compression scheme, that is compatible with SecAgg, based on sparse random projections. Due to linearity, our approach should be compatible with their method, and lead to reduced communications while still allowing for joint noise scaling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We leave the detailed consideration and comparison of the possible methods for reducing the required communication budget beyond what is possible by pushing more optimisation steps to the clients while reducing FL rounds for future work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, while many of the contributions cited above, e.g., novel DP mechanisms, are not limited to cross-device FL, all the experiments and use cases mentioned in the cited papers that are compatible with SecAgg and use multiple local steps only consider joint noise scaling with <em id="S2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">user- or client level DP</em> in cross-device FL. In contrast,
we focus on more fine-grained DP granularities, e.g., on <em id="S2.p7.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">sample-level DP</em>. As we discuss in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Background ‣ On Joint Noise Scaling in Differentially Private Federated Learning with Multiple Local Steps" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, combining sample-level DP with multiple local steps and joint noise scaling using SecAgg with good utility requires a novel privacy analysis. The main aim of this paper is to provide such an analysis.</p>

On each FL round, the server chooses a group of clients for an update and sends them the current model parameters. The chosen clients update their local model parameters by taking some amount of optimisation steps using only their own local data, and then send an update back to the server. The server then aggregates the client-specific contributions to update the global model.

<p id="S3.p9.1" class="ltx_p">While DP offers strict privacy protection, it comes at the cost of reduced model utility. This is especially true in the LDP setting, where each client protects their own data independently of any other party <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. One well-known technique to improve model utility in DPFL has been to utilise SecAgg to turn LDP guarantees into joint guarantees or distributed DP guarantees that depend on multiple clients (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>). However, naively combining fine-grained DP protection with SecAgg for distributed DP runs into problems, as we demonstrate in the rest of this section.</p>

<p id="S3.p13.1" class="ltx_p">As noted before, the obvious problem in using only a single local optimisation step per FL round is that the number of communication rounds is often one of the main bottlenecks in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, under some assumptions it is also possible to theoretically show that increasing the number of local steps leads to faster convergence (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, Theorem 3.2]</cite>). Our novel analysis therefore enables provably faster convergence under some assumptions (e.g., when the assumptions of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, Theorem 3.2]</cite> as well as those stated in Assumption <a href="#S4.Thmthm1" title="Assumption 4.1. ‣ 4 Joint Noise Calibration with Multiple Local Steps Using a Trusted Aggregator ‣ On Joint Noise Scaling in Differentially Private Federated Learning with Multiple Local Steps" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a> hold).

In effect, to allow for all hbc clients, we would need to scale up the noise level somewhat (see, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> for a discussion on noise scaling and for formal proofs).</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In principle, the same technique can also protect against privacy threats in the case of including some fully malicious clients in the protocol (i.e, simply scale the noise so that the hbc clients are enough to guarantee the required DP level). However, in this case the required level of extra noise will increase quickly with the number of malicious clients leading to heavier utility loss. With malicious clients, there would also be no guarantee that the learning algorithm terminates properly.</p>

and by exchanging the order of summation
the claim follows. Note that all the mechanisms are assumed to be DP w.r.t. their first argument for any given auxiliary value, which allows us to do the exchange without affecting privacy (in the context of FL, we effectively switch from communicating between each local step to
running all local steps and then communicating).

it is worth noting that
since the accounting relies on Lemma <a href="#S4.Thmthm6" title="Lemma 4.6. ‣ 4 Joint Noise Calibration with Multiple Local Steps Using a Trusted Aggregator ‣ On Joint Noise Scaling in Differentially Private Federated Learning with Multiple Local Steps" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.6</span></a>, which assumes releasing each local step while the actually released query answer is a sum over the local steps, the resulting privacy bound need not be tight, but an upper bound on the privacy budget. However, this matches the usual DP-SGD privacy accounting analysis (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>), which typically needs to account for each local optimisation step due to technical reasons even if only the final model is released. In the general case,
it has been shown that hiding the intermediate steps does not bring any privacy benefits compared to the per-step accounting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we empirically demonstrate the benefits of being able to run more than a single local optimisation step under limited communication budgets. Our chosen settings mimic a typical cross-silo FL setup: there are a limited number of clients, each having a smallish local database. The clients have enough local compute to run optimisation on the chosen model, while the server-client communications required for updating the global model are the main bottle-neck.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this setting, it makes sense to try and push more optimisation steps to the clients while reducing the number of global updates (FL rounds). We also assume that the clients send their local updates via some trusted aggregator (which we only assume and do not implement in practice in the experiments).

Since the inherent split is heterogeneous (different states have very number of samples as well as different data distributions), we would expect the benefits of doing more local optimisation steps between global communication rounds to dwindle, since the local models from different clients could diverge when only trained locally. However, as shown in Figure <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ On Joint Noise Scaling in Differentially Private Federated Learning with Multiple Local Steps" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, even in this setting taking more local steps is very beneficial.

<p id="Sx2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we do privacy accounting based on RDP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>: we account for the privacy of each individual local optimisation step with joint noise from all the clients selected for a given FL round. When the clients use Poisson subsampling to sample minibatches (we assume each client uses the same probability for including any individual sample in the minibatch), we use standard RDP privacy amplification results. In practice, we use the RDP accountant implemented in Opacus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, as well as bounds for Skellam mechanism from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and tight RDP amplification by Poisson subsampling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. We calculate the privacy cost of the entire training run in RDP, and then convert into ADP using <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, Proposition 3]</cite>. Note that, as is common in DP research, we do not include the privacy cost of hyperparameter tuning in the reported privacy budgets (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> for some reasoning on this practice).</p>

<p id="Sx2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use DP-SGD with Skellam mechanism to optimise the local model parameters, and standard federated averaging as the aggregation rule for updating the global model in all experiments. For each centralised data set (combining original train and test sets), we split the data randomly into equal shares, which results in having almost the same data distribution on each client.
For hyperparameter optimisation with each dataset, we first split each clients’ data internally into train and test parts with fractions (.8-.2). For tuning all hyperparameters, we use only the training fraction, and divide it further (.7-.3) into hyperparameter train-validation. We use Bayesian optimisation-based approach implemented in Weights and Biases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> for hyperparameter tuning, and simulate FL using Flower <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
