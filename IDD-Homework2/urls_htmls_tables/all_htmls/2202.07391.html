<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has been increasingly considered to preserve data training privacy from eavesdropping attacks in
mobile edge computing-based Internet of Thing (EdgeIoT). On the one hand, the learning accuracy of FL can be improved by selecting the IoT devices with large datasets for training, which gives rise to a higher energy consumption. On the other hand, the energy consumption can be reduced by selecting the IoT devices with small datasets for FL, resulting in a falling learning accuracy. In this paper, we formulate a new resource allocation problem for privacy-preserving EdgeIoT to balance the learning accuracy of FL and the energy consumption of the IoT device.
We propose a new federated learning-enabled twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (FL-DLT3) framework to achieve the optimal accuracy and energy balance in a continuous domain. Furthermore, long short term memory (LSTM) is leveraged in FL-DLT3 to predict the time-varying network state while FL-DLT3 is trained to select the IoT devices and allocate the transmit power. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FL-DLT3 achieves fast convergence (less than 100 iterations) while the FL accuracy-to-energy consumption ratio is improved by 51.8% compared to existing state-of-the-art benchmark.</p>

To prevent private data leakage of the IoT devices, federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is used to train a global data learning model at the edge server by aggregating the data structure parameters of the IoT devices, while the source data remains at the IoT devices.</p>

Specifically, mobile phones use image classification models to classify pictures or images. FL can help multiple mobile phones to cooperatively train an effective global image classification model, without the need of sharing the images and pictures used for the training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Likewise, vehicles can train an accurate autonomous driving model by aggregating the local models trained separately by multiple vehicles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A local model (e.g., the weight vector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> or gradient <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>) is trained on the sensing data of an IoT device to sense and process private information, such as private health reports of patients. Next, the edge server aggregates the local models of all IoT devices to create a comprehensive and effective global model without collecting the private data of the IoT devices. A global model is obtained at the edge server, e.g., by applying FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to the local models. The edge server broadcasts the global model back to all the IoT devices. According to the global model, each of the IoT devices renews the training of its local model. By iteratively training the local model at the IoT device and updating the global model at the edge server, the learning accuracy of FL on the data classification and event prediction can be progressively improved <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>

On the other hand, selecting the IoT devices with small data for training the local models can save the battery energy of the IoT devices, but likely leads to a low accuracy of the global model. In this sense, balancing the learning accuracy of FL and energy consumption of the IoT devices is crucial to EdgeIoT.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the FL process is time-slotted by design and sequential decision making is required. Hence, in this paper, we propose an online resource allocation optimization to balance the learning accuracy of FL and energy consumption of the IoT devices. In practice, the instantaneous information of data size, transmit power, and link qualities between the edge server and the IoT devices is unlikely to be known. The optimization is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where the network state consists of the source data size of the IoT devices, channel conditions between the edge server and the IoT devices, bandwidth and remaining energy of the selected IoT devices. All the entries of a network state are continuous. The action space includes the discrete selection of IoT devices and the continuous transmit power allocation. Given the continuous network states and actions, a large number of IoT nodes lead to a large state and action space, and complex network state transitions. This results in difficulty in the joint optimization of IoT device selection and transmit power allocation. Due to a large and continuous state and action space in the formulated POMDP, a new deep reinforcement learning-based device selection and transmit power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the ratio of the learning accuracy of FL and the energy consumption of the IoT devices.

A deep Q-learning-based resource allocation for data, energy, and CPU cycles is developed to reduce the energy consumption of FL-based mobile devices and training time of the FL. Given limited computation and communication resources at the devices, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> analyzes the convergence bound of distributed gradient descent.

advantage of the a-priori knowledge of the network state

<p id="S5.SS1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">The state and action space increases dramatically with the number of devices, and the action space has both continuous and discrete actions. Moreover, the network state, in practice, is not always observable at the edge server because the data size and remaining energy information of IoT devices are always kept locally before the server takes the devices selection. In view of these challenges, it is difficult to find the exact solution of <span id="S5.SS1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">P1</span>.

FL-DLT3 leverages the actor-critic neural network structure to develop the TD3-based deep reinforcement learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. The TD3 at the edge server is trained to optimize IoT device selection and transmit power allocation in a continuous action space, where the edge server has no priori information on the state transition probabilities. The LSTM is used to predict the hidden state of the IoT devices as input state of TD3. The AE gain is maximized over the large continuous state and action spaces. Specially, the global model is trained iteratively to improve the learning accuracy of the local model. With the growth of FL iterations, FL-DLT3 optimally selects the IoT devices to maximize the accuracy of FL while ensuring the energy consumption requirement.</p>

The edge server running the FL-DLT3 cannot observe the complete states of all the IoT devices. It can only make the observation of a IoT device when the device is selected and uploads its state information to the edge server. The learning efficiency and accuracy of the TD3-based FL-DLT3 can be compromised by the imperfect knowledge of the states of the IoT devices. Motivated by this fact, we develop a state characterization layer to predict the states of the IoT devices which are not observable, and feed the predicted states into the every neural network of FL-DLT3.</p>

In general, the proposed FL-DLT3 achieves the highest AE gain, as compared to the existing FedAECS, FedCS, and FedAvg, improved by 51.8%, 82.4% and 85.0% respectively. The reason is that FL-DLT3 leverages experience replay and predict the states of the IoT devices which are not observable, however, FedAECS, FedCS, and

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed FL-DLT3, which is a new deep reinforcement learning based resource allocation with FL for EdgeIoT. Given the large state and action space, FL-DLT3 learns the network state dynamics while maximizing the ratio of the learning accuracy of FL to the energy consumption of the IoT devices in a continuous domain. To improve the learning accuracy, a new state characterization layer based on LSTM is developed in FL-DLT3 to predict the time-varying data size, bandwidth, channel gain, and remaining energy of the IoT devices. FL-DLT3 is implemented in PyTorch. The effectiveness of FL-DLT3 is validated with the experimental data.</p>
