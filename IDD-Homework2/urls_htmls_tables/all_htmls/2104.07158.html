<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">User active authentication on mobile devices aims to learn a model that can correctly recognize the enrolled user based on device sensor information. Due to lack of negative class data, it is often modeled as a one-class classification problem. In practice, mobile devices are connected to a central server, e.g, all android-based devices are connected to Google server through internet. This device-server structure can be exploited by recently proposed Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) frameworks to perform collaborative learning over the data distributed among multiple devices. Using FL/SL frameworks, we can alleviate the lack of negative data problem by training a user authentication model over multiple user data distributed across devices. To this end, we propose a novel user active authentication training, termed as <span id="id3.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Federated Active Authentication (FAA)</span>, that utilizes the principles of FL/SL. We first show that existing FL/SL methods are suboptimal for FAA as they rely on the data to be distributed homogeneously (i.e. IID) across devices, which is not true in the case of FAA. Subsequently, we propose a novel method that is able to tackle heterogeneous/non-IID distribution of data in FAA. Specifically, we first extract feature statistics such as mean and variance corresponding to data from each user which are later combined in a central server to learn a multi-class classifier and sent back to the individual devices. We conduct extensive experiments using three active authentication benchmark datasets (MOBIO, UMDAA-01, UMDAA-02) and show that such approach performs better than state-of-the-art one-class based FAA methods and is also able to outperform traditional FL/SL methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have seen a surge in the number of mobile device users in the world. According to an estimate, nearly 60% of the world’s population own at least one mobile device<span id="footnotex1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world</span></span></span>. This increasing popularity is driven by the flexibility and convenience of mobile devices in handling many important tasks such as banking, finance management, social media, navigation etc. The handing of these tasks require users to store their personal information such as bank account details, social media profiles and other passwords in the mobile device. As a result, when mobile devices are lost or stolen it can compromise sensitive and private information of the user. Hence, increasing the security of mobile devices and protecting private information of users becomes extremely important. Most of the conventional authentication approaches prompt the user initially and grant access to the device until the session is over (i.e. explicit authentication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>). As long as the mobile phone remains active, typical devices incorporate no mechanisms to verify that the user originally authenticated is still the user in control of the device. Thus, unauthorized individuals may improperly obtain access to a user’s personal information if a password is compromised or if the user does not exercise adequate vigilance after initial authentication.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">User active authentication was specifically introduced to address this issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In user active authentication, built-in sensor information such as touch-sensor, gyroscope, microphone, accelerometer, camera, finger-print reader etc. are used to continuously monitor user <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. These sensors can capture behavioral (touch patterns, accelerometer etc.) or physiological (fingerprint, face etc.) biometric traits of the user. In this paper, we focus on developing active authentication systems based on face images collected by the front-facing camera of the device.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One way to develop such an authentication system would be to combine all user data from different devices in a central server and develop a multi-class classification model. However, it is not feasible to transfer mobile device data from multiple users to a server due to user data-privacy concerns. Most work in the literature overcome this issue by modeling active authentication as a one-class classification problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning-based Active Authentication on Mobile Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(a), in one-class based authentication systems only the data from an enrolled user is used to train the classifier which is later used to detect unauthorized users. However, such models often rely on prior assumptions and can be suboptimal due to the absence of negative class data during training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.2" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and Split Learning (SL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> frameworks were recently introduced in which mobile phones collaboratively learn a shared authentication model while keeping all the training data private on the individual devices. In the FL/SL framework, the model parameters are shared between server and mobile devices and the user data are kept on the individual devices. This makes information sharing between server-device feasible and addresses the user privacy concerns. The most popular algorithm to train deep neural networks in these frameworks is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning-based Active Authentication on Mobile Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(b), federated averaging algorithm trains a local model for all devices, which are averaged in a central server and sent back to the individual devices. However, the performance of FedAvg heavily relies on the assumption that data distribution across devices is independent and identically distributed, i.e. IID. For example, in a federated learning task of identifying <math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>-users, each device is required to contain sufficient data from all <math id="S1.p4.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.p4.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p4.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.2.m2.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.2.m2.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> users. When the device data distribution deviates from this IID assumption, (i.e., becomes non-IID), the performance of FedAvg algorithm drops significantly (see <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Challenges ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Federated Learning-based Active Authentication on Mobile Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>). This creates a problem for active authentication where the device data are distributed in a highly non-IID manner. Specifically, in the active authentication setting, each device contains data from only a single user. Hence, directly applying existing FL/SL algorithms will not be useful for federated active authentication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel method for active authentication in the FL/SL framework that addresses these issues by tackling the non-IID nature of the distribution of data among mobile devices. In the proposed method, we first train the full model on an exiting publicly available face recognition dataset. This pre-trained model is then split into a feature extractor network and a classifier network. We share the feature extractor network to all devices which is used to get the feature statistics from data samples of the enrolled user. This makes information sharing between device-server more efficient as we need to share only feature statistics instead of features from the entire dataset. Each device estimates the feature mean and variance, which we call <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">user impressions</span>. We send these <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">user impressions</span> of all users to a central server where the classifier network is trained on the dataset created by sampling from individual user statistics. This process is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Federated Learning-based Active Authentication on Mobile Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We evaluate the proposed method on three active authentication datasets – MOBIO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, UMDAA-01 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and UMDAA-02 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Experiments show that the proposed method is able perform better than the previous one-class classification-based methods and existing FL/SL approaches.</p>

Most conventional approaches utilize off-the-shelf one-class classification models such as one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, support vector data descriptor (SVDD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, mini-max probability machine (MPM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> etc. These one-class classifiers are trained on either hand-crafted features or features extracted from a pre-trained deep neural network. Few recent works attempt to extend these basic one-class classifier formulations by adding more constraints to their objective functions. Noticeably, the work by Perera and Patel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> extends single mini-max probability machine (SMPM) formulation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> with additional hyperplane constraint to propose a better one-class classifier called dual-minimax probability machines (DMPM).

However, the proposed method is more communication efficient as it requires only one round of forward and backward information passing between server and mobile devices as opposed to SL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which requires multiple rounds. Additionally, instead of directly passing the features of individual data points in mobile devices as done in SL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, we only share feature statistics of the individual mobile device data.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">As explained in the previous section, the key challenge in FAA is the non-IID nature of the data distribution across mobile devices. This issue directly affects the user authentication performance. First, let us briefly discuss the definition of independent and identically distributed data. In the context of federated learning, when data is said to be distributed in an IID manner, it means that each device has equal number of data samples from all users. This is the most common assumption in federated learning and is very crucial to train a model using the FedAvg algorithm. To show how deviation from this assumption affects the performance of FedAvg algorithm, let us quantify the <span id="S3.SS2.p1.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IID-ness</span> of the data distributed among devices.

The more distribution of data among devices in the federated learning framework deviates from the IID assumption, the performance of FedAvg degrades significantly. The reason for this reduction in performance is due to averaging of weights at the central server. This makes sense as the individual models are trained on the data with similar data distributions.

(b) Modeling as a one-class classification problem to learn a decision boundary for user-1. When such a model is tested there are many samples from user-2 and user-3 that are mis-classified as user-1. (c) Learning a decision boundary using the proposed method to train the authentication model for user-1 using user-1, user-2 and user-3’s mean and variance. This model does not make the same mistake of mis-classifying user-2 and user-3 data as user-1 similar to one-class based method. As can be seen from the figure, the learned decision boundary is also better in comparison to one-class method.</figcaption>

The current state-of-the-art algorithms model the active authentication problem as one-class classification. Due to this, the classifier learned to separate a particular user data still has some risk of failing to restrict the device access to other users, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3.3.1 Training ‣ 3.3 Proposed method ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Federated Learning-based Active Authentication on Mobile Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(b).

The data is collected using smart phones and/or laptop. For experiments, we only consider the face data. Out of the three datasets, MOBIO is relatively easy as it contains only front facing face images captured in well-lit conditions. Sample images are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.2 Datasets ‣ 4 Experiments and results ‣ Federated Learning-based Active Authentication on Mobile Devices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>(a). The figures provide a reasonable illustration of the variations present in the dataset. For the experiment, we consider the first 75 individuals as the enrolled users and the remaining 75 individuals as unknown/unauthorized users. We create a 50/50 split of data for training and testing for all 150 individuals.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a novel approach for user active authentication based on federated and split learning frameworks, called Federate Active Authentication. We point out the limitations of existing active authentication methods that model it as a one-class classification problem. The proposed method utilizes the federated/split learning framework to go beyond the one-class assumption for user active authentication. We also show that existing federated/split learning algorithms perform poorly on the federated active authentication setting. To address these issues, we proposed a novel method that extracts feature statistics of each user and trains a classification network to perform a multi-class classification, resulting in an efficient training strategy and improved authentication model. The proposed method is evaluated on three publicly available datasets and it is shown that it can perform better compared to both one-class modeling based active authentication methods and existing federated/split learning approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method under varying number of enrolled and unknown/unauthorized users.</p>
