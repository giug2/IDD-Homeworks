<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">As artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wireless communication systems continue their evolution, distributed learning has gained widespread attention for its ability to offer enhanced data privacy protection, improved resource utilization, and enhanced fault tolerance within wireless communication applications. Federated learning further enhances the ability of resource coordination and model generalization across nodes based on the above foundation, enabling the realization of an AI-driven communication and computing integrated wireless network. This paper proposes a novel wireless communication system to cater to a personalized service needs of both privacy-sensitive and privacy-insensitive users. We design the system based on based on multi-agent federated weighting deep reinforcement learning (MAFWDRL). The system, while fulfilling service requirements for users, facilitates real-time optimization of local communication resources allocation and concurrent decision-making concerning computing resources. Additionally, exploration noise is incorporated to enhance the exploration process of off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for wireless channels. Federated weighting (FedWgt) effectively compensates for heterogeneous differences in channel status between communication nodes. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline methods significantly in terms of throughput, calculation latency, and energy consumption improvement.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to relevant studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, the current number of wireless communication access networks is significantly and continuously growing. A large number of wireless devices will be connected to these networks, resulting in massive data transmission and task computation requirements. The traditional cloud computing paradigm is not suitable for latency-sensitive applications and fails to meet the wireless communication latency-sensitive demands of future network systems. To address this issue, researchers have introduced mobile edge computing (MEC) into the field of wireless communication. Internet of things (IoT) devices can offload data and computational tasks to edge servers. This could have several advantages to the future wireless systems: 1) Processing computational tasks at edge devices or edge servers reduces round-trip data transmission time, which is crucial for latency-sensitive communication scenarios like autonomous driving, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). 2) Edge computing nodes can locally process computational tasks, which reduce server load and time delay for data transmission from terminal devices to server. 3) Edge computing can decentralize computation loads, thereby lowering the probability of network congestion. 4) Deploying computational resources at the edge allows for local task computation, thereby reducing security risks associated with long distance transmitting privacy-sensitive data.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, considering the distributed deployment characteristics of the future wireless network, if the centralized learning method is still adopted in the future network, this will cause the algorithm strategy to be unable to expand to large-scale network systems, and cannot cope with increasingly complex wireless network communication needs. Therefore, in order to meet the requirements of future distributed communication scenarios, research on network optimization for distributed communication problems is essential. In a distributed mobile communication scenario, effectively managing computing tasks and communication resources is a complex issue that needs to jointly consider computing task priorities, resource allocation, and scheduling strategies to achieve efficient computing and communication services. Tang <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> considered deployment of a deep learning model (deep learning, DL) to optimize the problem that is difficult to complete local training and upload weights to the edge server in time, which effectively reduces the computing delay.

For privacy-sensitive and privacy-insensitive user equipments (UEs) in distributed networks, Huang <em id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> adjusted an FL strategy to optimize computing resources allocation and reduce computing delay.

</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, when multiple nodes are involved in computing and communication tasks, it is necessary to consider the issue of coordinating data updates and synchronization among nodes to ensure the accuracy and consistency of calculations. In addition, task computing and communication will also affect each other. When the computing task delay is too long, the waiting time for communication will increase, and vice versa, which will directly degrade the overall performance of the system. In addition, privacy and security issues are also important and difficult challenges in wireless communication systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Each node may face security risks such as tampering, eavesdropping, and unauthorized access during data transmission. For privacy-sensitive UEs with security risks, effective security measures must be taken to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.5" class="ltx_p">Without loss of generality, to realize the MAFWDRL application, this paper constructs a wireless communication environment following Wi-Fi standards using the NS3-simulator. It is worth mentioning that the actions and states of individual agents can be adjusted as necessary to suit Non-Wi-Fi standard wireless scenarios. The objective of this paper is to optimize communication and computing resource allocation in scenarios with varying degrees of communication sensitivity, aiming to minimize the dispersion of task weights by federated learning in the wireless system, minimize federated energy consumption or calculation latency, and maximize system throughput.

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Introducing exploration noise is an effective approach to address the limited exploration capability in off-policy DRL. During the learning process of NN, our objective is to encourage extensive exploration of the environment by the early-stage network, enabling the collection of a diverse range of environmental states. With the exploration progressing, the scale of noise decreases at an accelerated rate. As the later-stage NN network approaches convergence, the noise level tends to a lower bound for the exploration.

<p id="S3.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of our distributed wireless system is to optimize the throughput and calculation latency or calculation energy consumption of the overall system. If the actions are entirely independent, certain constraints will arise that impact the system as a whole. Taking these considerations into account, we propose a system optimization framework based on the MAFWDRL method for wireless systems with privacy-sensitive and privacy-insensitive requirements. We consider soft MADRL under the off-policy mechanism as the core optimization algorithm. Our algorithm, as shown in Algorithm 1, consists of three main components: 1) Privacy-sensitive users learn actor NN and critic NN based solely on local information. 2) Privacy-insensitive users, having no concerns about privacy issues, would benefit more from prioritizing the semi-centralized training mode to enhance system performance. 3) A FedWgt learning approach is employed to optimize the global NN model.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The experiment involves the construction of a cross-platform collaboration simulation for NS3 (communication terminal) and Python (AI terminal) using NS3AI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. This simulation platform ensures the reality and reliability of the communication system simulation. The communication process between the STAs and the AP is fully captured by the NS3 terminal, spanning from the application layer to the physical layer. However, our focus lies in the adjustment of certain network parameters in the MAC layer through AI methods. Within this section, we present simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MAFWDRL algorithm for jointly optimizing computing and communication resource allocation in distributed wireless systems. The impact of adjusting specific parameters of the MAFWDRL algorithm and the execution strategy on wireless communication networks is considered in our analysis.</p>

Therefore, reward 1) is more conducive to throughput improvement than reward 2). The simulation analysis results align with our theoretical analysis, thereby enabling the MAFWDRL model to effectively address the diverse communication needs for the future. Furthermore, in Fig. 7, we note that the throughput for both privacy-sensitive and privacy-insensitive users remains relatively consistent. This consistency arises from the federated weighted policy, which synchronously updates all training model parameters on the server and transmits them to the agent within the same communication environment. This approach allows the model to compensate for differences between privacy-sensitive and privacy-insensitive training modes. From the perspective of algorithm application, the simulation results show that the throughput performance of the proposed FedWgt strategy is significantly better than that of the FedAvg strategy in scheme 1) and scheme 2). Theoretical analysis shows that the greater the difference between agents, the better the FedWgt strategy is than the FedAvg strategy, and the model has stronger generalization ability.</p>

Figs 8(a) and 8(c) depict the global average latency and convergence latency achieved under reward scheme 1, while Figs. 8(b) and 8(d) illustrate the outcomes for reward scheme 2. The global average latency is indicative of the multi-agent algorithm’s stability, whereas convergence latency reflects the optimal performance attainable by the model. Under reward scheme 2, the MAFWDRL exhibits superior performance in terms of global average latency, maintaining stability within a 500 ms latency constraint, thereby demonstrating enhanced algorithmic stability. Conversely, the MAFADRL achieves a lower convergence latency, correlated to its reduced throughput compared to MAFWDRL. With reward scheme 1, both MAFWDRL and MAFADRL display not stable enough for the wireless system. MAFWDRL’s higher system throughput results in a larger optimal convergence latency which absent a latency constraint. Furthermore, our simulations reveal that under the architecture designed in this study, both FedAvg and FedWgt enable agents to converge to an improved system state.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Fig.s 7 and 8 present the results that form the basis for the analysis in Fig. 9, which illustrates the total energy consumption of both MAFADRL and the proposed MAFWDRL. It is observed that MAFWDRL demonstrates superior system throughput compared to MAFADRL. Consequently, the lower bound for the total energy consumption of MAFWDRL is expected to be higher than that of MAFADRL. Moreover, the trend in total energy consumption depicted in Fig. 9 is consistent with the patterns observed in Fig. 7, further corroborating this conclusion.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel wireless intelligent distributed communication system based on MAFWDRL. The system comprises two core modules: the MADRL module and the FedWgt module. To address the crucial issue of privacy security, we have devised distinct MADRL training modes for various privacy categories. These training modes effectively tackle the challenge of distributed wireless resource allocation while ensuring robust user privacy protection. However, one limitation of this training approach is that it mainly concentrates on the local communication status of individual agents, overlooking the intricate interplay of communication resource allocation across the entire distributed system. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a FedWgt strategy that considers the diverse training needs of each agent model while protecting the security of privacy. This innovative approach optimizes the global critic model, endowing it with the versatility to accommodate different privacy types. Additionally, we delve into the design of the noise curve within the off-policy DRL model, enabling the model to explore more extensively, enriching the experiment pool of the system, and elevating model optimization performance. The results of our simulation experiments underscore the substantial enhancements achieved by our MAFWDRL model. Notably, it significantly boosts the throughput of the entire communication system, and diminishes computing latency and energy consumption, all while maintaining stringent privacy security requisites.</p>
