<p id="id4.4" class="ltx_p">Although federated learning improves privacy of training data by exchanging local gradients or parameters rather than raw data, the adversary still can leverage local gradients and parameters to obtain local training data by launching reconstruction and membership inference attacks. To defend such privacy attacks, many noises perturbation methods (like differential privacy or CountSketch matrix) have been widely designed. However, the strong defence ability and high learning accuracy of these schemes cannot be ensured at the same time, which will impede the wide application of FL in practice (especially for medical or financial institutions that require both high accuracy and strong privacy guarantee). To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose <em id="id4.4.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">an efficient model perturbation method for federated learning</em> to defend reconstruction and membership inference attacks launched by curious clients. On the one hand, similar to the differential privacy, our method also selects random numbers as perturbed noises added to the global model parameters, and thus it is very efficient and easy to be integrated in practice. Meanwhile, the random selected noises are positive real numbers and the corresponding value can be arbitrarily large, and thus the strong defence ability can be ensured. On the other hand, unlike differential privacy or other perturbation methods that cannot eliminate the added noises, our method allows the server to recover the true gradients by eliminating the added noises. Therefore, our method does not hinder learning accuracy at all. Extensive experiments demonstrate that for both regression and classification tasks, our method achieves the same accuracy as non-private approaches and outperforms the state-of-the-art related schemes. Besides, the defence ability of our method is significantly better than the state-of-the-art related defence schemes. Specifically, for the membership inference attack, our method achieves attack success rate (ASR) of around <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="50\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">50</mn><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">%</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.1">percent</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.2">50</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">50\%</annotation></semantics></math>, which is equivalent to blind guessing.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the continued emergence of privacy breaches and data abuse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, data privacy and security issues gradually impede the flourishing development of deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. In order to mitigate such privacy concerns, <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">federated learning</em> (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> has recently been presented as an appealing solution. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ An Accuracy-Lossless Perturbation Method for Defending Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, FL is essentially a distributed learning framework where many clients collaboratively train a shared global model under the orchestration of a central server, while ensuring that each client’s raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred.</p>
</div>
<figure id="S1.F1" class="ltx_figure"><img src="/html/2002.09843/assets/x1.png" id="S1.F1.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_landscape" width="269" height="111" alt="Refer to caption">
<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>The overall framework of federated learning. During the phase of deep model training, clients run stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm on local training data to compute local gradients and upload them. After receiving local gradients from clients, the server aggregates them, updates the current global model parameters, and then distributes the updates global model parameters to clients for the next iteration.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As we all know, data is the huge digital wealth in recent big data era, and thus all clients (especially for companies) wants to obtain as much training data as possible. And if clients own enough training data, they can train an effective model independently, instead of joining the Fl to share the trained global model. This can totally protect privacy and save huge overheads, especially for communication overhead. FL seemingly can protect the training data of clients by exchanging local gradients and current model parameters rather than raw data, however, sharing local gradients and model parameters is still a well-known privacy risk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Specifically, inference attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> has been widely adopted to reconstruct or infer the property of clients’ training data based on the model output. Inference attacks on FL mainly includes two attacks: tracing (a.k.a. membership inference) attacks, and reconstruction attacks. The goal of <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">reconstruction attacks</em> is to recover original training data as accurate as possible. The goal of <em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">membership inference attacks</em> is to infer if a particular individual data record was included in
the training dataset. This is a decisional problem, and its accuracy directly demonstrates the leakage of the model about its training data. Note that we mainly focus on the privacy attacks that will leak the training data of clients, and thus other attacks are beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To defense inference attacks launched by curious clients, many privacy-preserving federated learning schemes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> widely adopt the <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">differential privacy</em> technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> due to its theoretical guarantee of privacy protection and low computational and communication complexity. However, there is a trade-off between privacy guarantee and learning accuracy. If the added noises is strong, the differential privacy works for defence, but the noise inevitably hurts the accuracy and may even stop FL from making progress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. If the noise is not strong enough, the defence may face failure. In order to overcome such drawback, many related works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> have been designed. For example, the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> has suggested to randomly select and share a small fraction of gradient elements (those with large magnitudes) to reduce privacy loss. Fan et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> have leveraged element-wise adaptive gradients perturbations to defeat reconstruction attacks and maintain high model accuracy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, a CountSketch matrix is used to perturb global model parameters for defending reconstruction and membership inference attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, the defence ability and learning accuracy of these schemes are still unsatisfactory, especially for medical or financial institutions that require both high accuracy and strong privacy guarantee. The main reason is that the perturbed noises added in gradients or model parameters cannot be eliminated, which will inevitably reduce the learning accuracy compared with the training without perturbation. Meanwhile, the defence ability is not strong enough due to the utility consideration in practice (i.e., It should avoid reducing the learning accuracy too much to make the trained model unusable). Therefore, how to design an efficient method in FL that can ensure high defence ability for inference attacks without sacrificing learning accuracy is still a big challenge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.2" class="ltx_p">Note that we admit that our method alone does not fundamentally defend all the attacks launched from curious clients. As claimed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, there does not exist any defense that is effective for all the attacks that infer privacy. Meanwhile, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, we focus on the inference attacks launched by curious clients and do not consider the attacks launched by the server. Actually, we can assume the server is honest and clients are honest-but-curious. To the best of our knowledge, this assumption is widespread in the real word. For example, a insurance headquarter requires all its subsidiaries to join the FL to train a global model for analyzing the insurance behavior of customers. Obviously, the headquarter is trusted by all subsidiaries, but the competing relationships between subsidiaries and they distrust each other, so it should be ensured that none of subsidiaries can obtain the private data of other subsidiaries. If we want to consider both the server and clients are honest-but-curious, our method can be easily incorporated with existing methods such as homomorphic encryption, secret sharing or secure multi-party computing to satisfy the privacy-preserving requirements.</p>

This is a decisional problem, and its accuracy directly demonstrates the leakage of the model about the corresponding training data. Note that, since the privacy preservation is our focus, other active attacks (like poisoning attacks or backdoor attacks) that will destroy the integrity or availability are beyond the scope of this work and will be discussed in the future.</p>

More specifically, it is better for our scheme to achieve the same model accuracy as the plain training model, e.g., FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we evaluate our method for the classification task with ResNet20, ResNet32 and ResNet56 models on the LDC and CIFAR-10 datasets. All the training methods adopt the cross entropy as the loss function. The accuracy of converged models on testsets is shown in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ VI-B2 Classification ‣ VI-B Learning Accuracy ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ An Accuracy-Lossless Perturbation Method for Defending Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>. From the table, we can obtain the learning accuracy of our method elegantly aligns with the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and has significant advantage over PPDL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, SPN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and DBCL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Note that one of the appealing features of our method is to allow clients to train over noisy models without accuracy loss. To this end, we further empirically prove this claim by comparing the convergence process of our method against the FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Specifically, we train ResNet20 and ResNet32 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> models on Lesion Disease Classification dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> for <math id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="200" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">200</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">200</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1c">200</annotation></semantics></math> epochs for our method and the FedAvg, respectively. For the fairness of comparison, we use different random seeds for each run, and set the seeds for our method and the FedAvg to be the same. Then we demonstrate the mean and standard deviation of test accuracy after each epoch in Figure <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VI-B2 Classification ‣ VI-B Learning Accuracy ‣ VI Performance Evaluation ‣ An Accuracy-Lossless Perturbation Method for Defending Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. As shown in the figure, the convergence process of our method and the FedAvg is almost exactly consistent. Although the curves of our method and the FedAvg may be noisy in the early stage, they tend to stabilize and converge to similar results as the training proceeds.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we launch two types of reconstruction attacks. On the one hand, recent research, dubbed GMI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, found that the private images from the training set of a certain model can be easily reconstructed with the help of a generative model (i.e. GAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>). Thus, we first perform the experiments to show the defence ability of the attack that reconstruct the training images of certain category with the model output. On the other hand, Zhu et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> presented the reconstruct attack, dubbed DLG, to recover training data from the local gradient information in FL. Thus, we also perform experiments to show the defence ability of the attack that reconstruct the training data from the local gradients.</p>

We evaluate the defensive ability of existing defence methods against GMI on LDC and CIFAR-10 datasets. Specifically, following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, we evenly split the training set based on the labels, and use one half as private set and the remainder as public set (the labels in the public set and private set have no overlaps). We evaluate the defence ability under the most strict setting: the attacker does not have any auxiliary knowledge about the private image, in which case he/she will recover the image from scratch. Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, we adopt the following three metrics for evaluation: 1) Attack success rate (ASR): the prediction accuracy of the attacked model over the <span id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">reconstructed images</span>; 2) Feature Distance (Feat Dist): the feature distance between the reconstructed image and the centroid of the target class. The feature space is taken to be the output of the penultimate layer of the attacked model; and 3) K-Nearest Neighbor Distance (KNN Dist): We select the closest data point to the reconstructed image in the training set and the KNN Dist is set as their <math id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="l_{2}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">l</mi><mn id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑙</ci><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">2</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS3.SSS2.p2.1.m1.1c">l_{2}</annotation></semantics></math> distance in the feature space.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) was formally introduced by Google in 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to address data privacy in machine learning. However, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proved that the original FL schemes still face the risk of privacy leakage. Specifically, two types of inference attacks called reconstruction and membership inference attacks have been widely leveraged to obtain local training data of clients. To defend these two privacy attacks, some compression methods such as selective gradients sharing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, reducing dimensionality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> were presented to decrease information disclosure, thereby defending against privacy attacks. However, these methods were proved to be almost ineffective for the defence ability or had a negative impact on the quality of the FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. After that, due to the high efficiency and easy integration, differential privacy technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> was widely adopted in FL to improve the defence ability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> demonstrated how to maintain data privacy by adding Gaussian noise to shared gradients during the training of deep neural network. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> also suggested adding Gaussian noise to shared gradients to defend reconstruction attacks. However, differential privacy-based methods sacrifice model accuracy in exchange for privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, which is not suitable in some FL applications requiring high model accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Following the idea of differential privacy that injects random noises to perturb the shared parameters, the matrix sketching method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> was considered in FL to perturb the global model parameters. Besides, Fan et. al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> leveraged element-wise adaptive gradients perturbations to defend reconstruction and membership inference attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, these noises perturbation methods cannot achieve high learning accuracy and strong defence ability for reconstruction and membership inference attacks at the same time. Thus, in this paper, we try to design a novelty noise perturbation method that can achieve strong defence ability without sacrificing the learning accuracy. Note that there are other cryptography technologies, such as secure multi-party computation (MPC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> and homomorphic encryption (HE) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> were proposed to address privacy risks in FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. These schemes can provide strong privacy protection, but often incur significantly more demanding computational and communication cost while cannot be efficiently implemented in practice <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. In this paper, our work is similar to the differential privacy, and thus does not consider the MPC and HE based schemes therein and refer readers to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have presented an efficient model perturbation method in federated learning to defense the state-of-the-art privacy attacks launched by honest-but-curious clients. Specifically, the server perturbs the global model parameters by adding random selected noises before broadcasting them to clients, which prevents clients from obtaining true model parameters including the true local gradients. Therefore, it can defense two famous privacy attacks, i.e., reconstruction attack and membership inference attack. Meanwhile, unlike the differential privacy that cannot remove the added random noises, the proposed method ensures that the server can remove the added random noises from the aggregated local gradients, and thus would not reduce the learning accuracy. Extensive experiments about both regression and classification tasks demonstrate that the model accuracy of our scheme are almost the same as the plain training, and better than the state-of-the-art privacy defense schemes. Besides, extensive experiments about both reconstruction and membership inference attacks show that the defense ability of our scheme significantly outperforms than the state-of-the-art privacy defense schemes.</p>
