<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention as a promising approach to driving a vast number of end devices with artificial intelligence. However, it is very challenging to guarantee the efficiency of FL considering the unreliable nature of end devices while the cost of device-server communication cannot be neglected. In this paper, we propose SAFA, a semi-asynchronous FL protocol, to address the problems in federated learning such as low round efficiency and poor convergence rate in extreme conditions (e.g., clients dropping offline frequently). We introduce novel designs in the steps of model distribution, client selection and global aggregation to mitigate the impacts of stragglers, crashes and model staleness in order to boost efficiency and improve the quality of the global model. We have conducted extensive experiments with typical machine learning tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is effective in terms of shortening federated round duration, reducing local resource wastage, and improving the accuracy of the global model at an acceptable communication cost.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT), the advance in Machine Learning (ML) techniques stimulates the demand of compute capacity significantly from a broad range of applications which more or less integrate Artificial Intelligent (AI) into the edge and end devices to empower their underlying business logic. By 2022, more than 80% of enterprise IoT projects are expected to have AI components embedded <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Gartner</span>]</cite>. Also, it has been an emerging trend that users are becoming more sensitive to the data privacy protection mechanism of AI applications, while their performance, in many cases, is still expected to be guaranteed in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is promising for intelligent applications to learn their models on massively distributed data. However, there are still several obstacles to date. First, it is unrealistic to collect decentralized data constantly from all the end devices and store them in a centralized location, which can probably cause a lot of potential risks (e.g., data leakage) and poses privacy threats to end users. Second, it could be communication-intensive to train a global model using traditional optimization methods, no matter in a cloud-central or a distributed manner. On-cloud centralized training incurs heavy load (as well as big risks) in data transfer when moving the data from the edge of network to the cloud, whilst most distributed optimization approaches incur fairly frequent communications between devices and the cloud in order to exchange gradients (of a mini-batch, typically) and weights. However, in practical circumstances (e.g., edge computing environments), the devices are hardly reliable and the cost of communication can be prohibitive. For example, devices may drop offline intermittently and data transfer is charged in cellular networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Privacy concerns may prohibit moving data outside local devices. Machine learning in such environments is challenging due to the following properties: 1) <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Unbalanced and biased data distribution</span>: the end devices may own a variable amount of on-device data and the distribution of the data in different devices may be different; 2) <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Massive distribution</span>: it is usual to see a huge fleet of disparate devices at the edge as participants; 3) <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Unreliability</span>: either the devices themselves and the connection to the cloud are unreliable. End devices could opt out occasionally or go offline unexpectedly. The communication could be expensive.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_comm</span>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">origin_FL</span>]</cite>, a promising framework, was proposed by Google to address the aforementioned challenges. The work presents a distributed solution (i.e., Federated Optimization) to optimizing a global machine learning model without moving data out of local devices, and introduces <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> as an optimization protocol in federated setting. Rather than collecting gradients from clients (i.e., end devices), FedAvg adopts a different approach, in which multiple iterations of local updates (using gradient descent) are followed by a global aggregation that takes a weighted average of the resulting models from the clients. An obvious advantage of FedAvg is the reduction of communication frequency. FedAvg and many implementations of FL systems (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_system</span>]</cite>) adopt synchronous training protocols to avoid the prohibitive number of updates. Although synchronous protocols seem to be the natural choice for the FL setting, a number of limitations stand out as follows: 1) <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Unreliable fraction of effective participants</span>: in each round, the server selects a fraction of clients randomly to perform local training and expects them to commit their local training results. However, the number of clients which manage to commit their results are very uncertain given the unreliable nature of end devices; 2) <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Low round efficiency</span>: To aggregate the local results at the end of each round, FedAvg has to wait for all selected clients to finish, among which there may be stragglers while the crashed ones may never respond. Consequently, the global learning progress is suspended until a timeout threshold is reached; 3) <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Under-utilization of clients</span>: With random selection, many capable clients are likely to remain idle even if they are ready and willing to participate in the training; 4) <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Progress waste</span>: The selected clients may not finish local training in time, and the progress made could be wasted because the client will be forced to overwrite its local model with the global model next time when the client is selected again.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Semi-Asynchronous Federated Averaging (SAFA) protocol based on FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">origin_FL</span>]</cite> to achieve fast, lag-tolerant federated optimization. SAFA takes advantage of several efficiency-boosting features from asynchronous machine learning approaches (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">async_multi_task</span>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FedAsync</span>]</cite>) while making use of a refined pace steering mechanism to mitigate the impact of straggling clients and stale models (i.e., staleness <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FedAsync</span>]</cite>) on the global learning progress. Moreover, we adopt a novel aggregation algorithm that exploits a cache structure (in the cloud) to bypass a fraction of client updates so as to improve convergence rate at a low cost of communication.

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed machine learning is believed to be an ideal solution for big data analytics according the rule ”moving computation closer to data”. However, the majority of distributed ML approaches (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">distML1</span>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">distML2</span>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DC-ASGD</span>]</cite>) claim their efficacy based on the conditions such as homogeneity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">DC-ASGD</span>]</cite>, high-performance nodes, ultra-fast connections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">QSGD</span>]</cite> and so on, which are unrealistic in edge computing or IoT environment. In fact, end devices in an edge environment can be fairly unreliable, highly heterogeneous in performance and have limited communication. The limitation of data access is another prominent issue. Many distributed ML approaches cannot achieve the desired accuracy without making the entire dataset available to every worker. However, it is impossible in many situations to gather the data from a massive number of distributed devices given the expensive communication (via cellular networks) and, most importantly, the data privacy requirements by end users <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">IBM_FL</span>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">origin_FL</span>]</cite>, first proposed by Google, is a new approach to fitting machine learning into the edge. The survey by Zhou et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">EI3</span>]</cite> summarizes recent studies on edge intelligence and lists FL as one of the most uprising technologies for distributed training at the edge. As the primitive FL protocol, <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAvg</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">origin_FL</span>]</cite> was designed to perform synchronous optimization in federated settings. Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FedAsync</span>]</cite> proposed <span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FedAsync</span>, an asynchronous federated optimization scheme that regularizes local optimization and adopts the non-blocking update of the global model. A similar protocol has been exploited by Sprague et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">Async_geo</span>]</cite> in a geo-spatial application for training a global model asynchronously, allowing the devices to join halfway. However, the main issue of the asynchronous approaches is that the server may receive too many local updates sent from a massive number of clients that remain active, which could overwhelm the server but with little benefit to the model convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In terms of model accuracy, Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">exp_SSGD</span>]</cite> experimentally demonstrated that synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can outperform asynchronous approaches in the data center setting, which to some extent inspired the synchronous design of FL. A number of variants have been proposed to mitigate the deficiencies of FL from different aspects such as round efficiency <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FedCS</span>]</cite> and communication cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_comm</span>]</cite>. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FL_WangS</span>]</cite> proposed a control algorithm that adaptively determines the interval of global aggregation under a given resource budget. To address the inefficiency of FL under poor wireless channel conditions, Nishio and Yonetani <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">FedCS</span>]</cite> implemented a mobile edge computing (MEC) framework in which a protocol is designed to filter out slow clients based on the estimation of the clients’ work time at the selection stage and consequently shorten round length. However, their scheme relies on accurate estimation and does not take the client unreliability into account.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">How to speedup the convergence rate of FL remains an open challenge. On this point, we argue that the optimization mechanisms for traditional distributed SGD have great potential in FL. For example, gradient staleness control has been shown critical to guarantee convergence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">staleness1</span>]</cite>. Dutta et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">staleness2</span>]</cite> theoretically characterized the trade-off between reducing error (by including more stragglers) and shortening run time (by bounding staleness). Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">staleness3</span>]</cite> refined ASGD by modulating the learning rate based on the staleness of incoming gradients.

Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">backup_workers</span>]</cite> introduced backup workers to reduce server waiting time in synchronous stochastic optimization. Inspired by these approaches, we investigate the impact of straggling clients and model staleness on FL, and design a fast FL protocol that is well adapted to unreliable environments.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the federated setting, an important guarantee for the convergence of the global model is the quality of local models. The quality of a local model depends on whether local training is sufficient (i.e., training sufficiency) and on the starting model on which local training is based. Training sufficiency can be achieved by allowing adequate local iterations (i.e., epochs), while the version control is a non-trivial task. The original FL algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">origin_FL</span>]</cite> prevents outdated clients with stale models from committing, which simplifies FL process but also throttles the potential of accelerating convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by the problem, we first present a lag-tolerant model distribution algorithm which does not always enforce synchronization (i.e., allows some clients to stay asynchronous with the cloud) and is tolerant to outdated local models (i.e., staleness). The key idea is to develop a better way to get the stragglers (i.e., clients with stale models) involved in the model aggregation and leverage their progress for faster federated learning. In this paper, we refer <span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stragglers</span> to the clients who are slow and still conducting local training based on an outdated model. Normally, the clients are supposed to start epochs of training based on the latest global model received from the server. However, device crashes or network problems generate the stragglers inevitably.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With a version-based criterion, SAFA only requires specific clients to retrieve the latest global model from the server. Before a round of local training starts, the server classifies all clients into three states (or categories) based on their current versions: <span id="S3.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Up-to-date</span>, <span id="S3.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">deprecated</span> and <span id="S3.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">tolerable</span>, which are defined as follows.</p>
