<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">SynDiffix is a new open-source tool for structured data synthesis. It has anonymization features that allow it to generate multiple synthetic tables while maintaining strong anonymity. Compared to the more common single-table approach, multi-table leads to more accurate data, since only the features of interest for a given analysis need be synthesized. This paper compares SynDiffix with 15 other commercial and academic synthetic data techniques using the SDNIST analysis framework, modified by us to accommodate multi-table synthetic data. The results show that SynDiffix is many times more accurate than other approaches for low-dimension tables, but somewhat worse than the best single-table techniques for high-dimension tables.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years there has been a lot of interest in synthetic structured data for statistical disclosure control. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a research program <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> to better understand the utility and privacy of data deidentification mechanisms. They have developed the SDNIST software tool and several sample datasets to analyze and compare the utility and privacy of synthetic data mechanisms<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://github.com/usnistgov/sdnist</span></span></span>. NIST has so far archived the test results of nearly 30 different techniques from more than a dozen organizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are a variety of use cases for synthetic data, including for instance data enhancement and generating test data. These use cases do not necessarily require that the synthetic data very accurately mimics the original data. Indeed sometimes the goal is to modify the statistics of the original data, for instance to remove bias or increase certain profiles.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The primary use case for SDNIST, however, is statistical disclosure. The goal is to replicate the original data as accurately as possible while preserving anonymity. The original datasets supplied by SDNIST come from US Census American Community Survey (ACS) data, and the SDNIST utility metrics measure how closely the synthetic data matches the original data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Most synthetic data techniques are designed to produce <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">single-table</em> datasets—all columns of the original dataset are synthesized to produce a single synthesized dataset. An advantage of single-table approaches is ease of use. The single table can be pulled into any data analysis tool and manipulated exactly as with the original data. An important disadvantage of single-table approaches, however, is that data accuracy degrades with increased columns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">An alternate approach is to make <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">multi-table</em> datasets. Each table synthesizes only the columns necessary for a given analytic task. For instance, suppose there are 50 columns in the data, and the analyst is interested in the correlation between two columns. In the single-table approach, nominally all 50 columns would be synthesized, and the two columns of interest taken from the 50-column synthesized table. In a multi-table approach, a synthesized table with only those two columns would be built.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In the multi-table approach thousands of tables, one for each analytic question, can easily be required. Multi-table is therefore only viable if it is strongly anonymous despite multiple tables. Prior synthetic data mechanisms do not have this characteristic. The more tables that are generated from the same data, the more privacy is lost. It is unknown how many tables can be built before anonymity is dangerously degraded, because existing systems are not designed to be used in multi-table mode, and therefore such testing is unnecessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Although multi-table is certainly less convenient than single-table, it is common practice among statistics offices to release data as multiple tables, each with a relatively small number of columns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">SynDiffix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is a new structured synthetic data generator that remains strongly anonymous no matter how many tables are generated (§<a href="#S2" title="2 Overview of SynDiffix ‣ A Comparison of SynDiffix Multi-table versus Single-table Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). This paper uses SDNIST to compare the utility and privacy of SynDiffix against 15 other mechanisms, each of which have been submitted to SDNIST by its respective developers. We show that SynDiffix is many times more accurate than the best alternative techniques for low-dimensional tables (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ A Comparison of SynDiffix Multi-table versus Single-table Synthetic Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Compared to the next best techniques, which are proprietary commercial products, SynDiffix’ median measure is many times more accurate for low-dimension measures: 10x more accurate for single-column measures, 17x more accurate for 2-column measures, and 2x more accurate for 3-column measures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">That advantage degrades for higher-dimension measures. For a 4-column measure (linear regression), SynDiffix is more accurate than most techniques, but 30% less accurate than the best techniques. For the 24-column measure (PCA), SynDiffix is again more accurate than most techniques, but 3x less accurate than the best technique.</p>

<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">We also show that, using SDNIST’s simple privacy metric, SynDiffix has very strong anonymity.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here we give a brief overview of SynDiffix. A full description can be found at <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">SynDiffix operates by building multi-dimensional search trees from the original data, and then assigning synthetic data from the nodes of the search trees. SynDiffix builds a family of trees with different dimensions: all one-dimension trees, all two-dimension trees, up to a single tree with all columns. Lower-dimension trees have better precision, while higher-dimension trees better capture the relationship between attributes. SynDiffix uses information from all trees to synthesize data. If the original data has too many columns to build all combinations of all dimensions, SynDiffix partitions the original table into multiple lower-dimension tables, synthesizes each table, and then merges them back together.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">SynDiffix’ anonymity derives from how it assigns nodes in the trees. The nodes themselves incorporate three core anonymization features, <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">range snapping, sticky noise, and aggregation</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Range snapping:</span> Unlike most search trees, which partition ranges by splitting them in half or in a way that balances the tree, SynDiffix forces ranges to conform to a fixed set of sizes and offsets. Specifically, ranges conform to a power-of-two sequence (<span id="S2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" style="font-size:90%;">..., 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, ...</span>), and likewise for offsets (a range of 2 can fall on offsets <span id="S2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" style="font-size:90%;">..., -2, 0, 2, 4, ...</span>). Text and datetime values are converted to numbers prior to tree building, and converted back when values are assigned from the tree nodes.</p>
</div>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Aggregation:</span> All nodes in all trees are aggregates of multiple individuals. Nodes without enough individuals are pruned from the trees. For time-series data, SynDiffix is configured to identify which rows belong to which individuals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sticky noise:</span> Noise is added to each node’s row count. The noise is sticky in that for any given node, as defined by the ranges and offsets of each attribute, the amount of noise is always the same.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Taken together, these three mechanisms lead to strong anonymization. Aggregation ensures that no individual data is released. Range snapping and sticky noise ensures that any given data value will always appear in the same limited set of aggregates with the same noise, no matter how many synthetic tables are generated. In this sense, SynDiffix is similar to the Cell Key Method used by the statistics offices of Australia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, Germany <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, and the UK <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. SynDiffix, however, generalizes the approach to work automatically, including with time-series data, and to produce synthetic data rather than tabular data.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For SynDiffix, we generated 455 separate tables, one for each column combination measured by SDNIST. These include 24 1-column tables, 181 2-column, 232 3-column, one 4-column, 16 9-column, and one 24-column table. This amounts to 1254 total columns, making the storage requirements for SynDiffix 52 times that of a single table. We used the default settings for SynDiffix’ average suppression threshold (5 rows), absolute suppression threshold (3 rows), and per-bucket noise standard deviation (1.4). It took just under 4 hours to generate all 455 synthetic tables on a windows laptop with 32G RAM and an Intel i7-7820HQ CPU running at 2.9GHz.</p>

One can find thousands of unique matches among subsets of columns. What is important is whether inferences well above a precision baseline can be made. Nevertheless, SDNIST tabulates the information, and so we repeat it for completeness.</p>

<p id="S4.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As a means of measuring synthetic data quality across all features, SDNIST runs a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the full dataset.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper compares SynDiffix, a new open-source tool for generating structured synthetic data, with 15 other techniques (both commercial and open source), for both privacy and utility metrics. SynDiffix is different from other approaches in that it can safely generate multiple tables, each focused on a given analytic goal. This makes SynDiffix suitable for census data, which commonly releases data as multiple tables.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Using the SDNIST measurement tool modified by us to work with multi-table data, we show that SynDiffix is many times more accurate than other techniques for low-dimension measures, but somewhat worse for high-dimension measures. This suggests that one approach statistics offices may take is to use SynDiffix to release multiple accurate low-dimensional tables, and use a generative technique to release a single full table suitable for ML applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While the present study allows for a direct comparison between techniques, it does not evaluate the efficacy of SynDiffix for real analytic use cases. Doing so is an important step in determining whether SynDiffix can serve as a replacement for existing statistical disclosure methods. We hope that the present study motivates work in this direction.</p>
