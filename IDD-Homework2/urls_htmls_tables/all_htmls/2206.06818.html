<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Attributes skew hinders the current federated learning (FL) frameworks from consistent optimization directions among the clients, which inevitably leads to performance reduction and unstable convergence. The core problems lie in that: 1) Domain-specific attributes, which are non-causal and only locally valid, are indeliberately mixed into global aggregation. 2) The one-stage optimizations of entangled attributes cannot simultaneously satisfy two conflicting objectives, i.e., generalization and personalization. To cope with these, we proposed disentangled federated learning (DFL) to disentangle the domain-specific and cross-invariant attributes into two complementary branches, which are trained by the proposed alternating local-global optimization independently. Importantly, convergence analysis proves that the FL system can be stably converged even if incomplete client models participate in the global aggregation, which greatly expands the application scope of FL. Extensive experiments verify that DFL facilitates FL with higher performance, better interpretability, and faster convergence rate, compared with SOTA FL methods on both manually synthesized and realistic attributes skew datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, as a decentralized and privacy-preserving machine learning framework, aims to build a client-server system that can adapt to different distributions without access to local raw data. A key challenge lies in the Non-i.i.d factors between clients’ data domains. The huge distribution shift comes from the diverse contextual information across devices/locations, which causes suboptimal or detrimental performance. In addition, the aggregated global model could be unstable and even nonconvergent due to the different optimization directions of client models. To mitigate this problem, a plethora of techniques are introduced to adjust the system, such as local model adaptation, global reweighting aggregation, and optimization direction correction. These methods make FL rapidly adapt to the local distributions and corresponding tasks. Although effective, the basic problem still exists. Especially, the attributes skew, as one challenging factor of Non-i.i.d, indicates the scenarios in which the representation distribution across attributes on each client is different from each other. The domain-specific attributes are inevitably extracted by the single-branch client model and mixed into the global aggregation. These attributes are decision-correlated but not causal, which is only locally valid. It leads to essential differences in the optimization directions of client models. Taking bird classification as an example in the left part of <a href="#S0.F1" title="In Disentangled Federated Learning for Tackling Attributes Skew via Invariant Aggregation and Diversity Transferring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The attributes of the bird itself and the blue sky are extracted by the client network simultaneously by the local extractor, which both contribute to the task decision in the flying birds’ domain. Unfortunately, this blue sky as domain-specific attributes will be infused into the global server by model aggregation. It causes performance degradation to the domain where birds all sit on tree branches. Because there is no blue sky in this data domain. This phenomenon of attributes skew distribution is widespread, which causes concerns about the robustness and the trustworthiness of the FL system.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To mitigate this negative transfer<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Negative transfer, i.e., leveraging other clients’ knowledge undesirably reduces the learning performance of the local client <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>)</cite>.</span></span></span> caused by attributes skew, we proposed disentangled federated learning (DFL). The motivation is to spin off the domain-specific attributes from model aggregation. However, the single-branch-based client model of the traditional FL framework cannot support DFL. The reason is that the specific and invariant attributes are entangled and extracted by a single extractor. Although these two attributes both contribute to the task decision locally, the huge differences are that: 1) invariant attributes are intrinsic and causal, which is cross-domain generic; 2) specific attributes are only locally valid, which may bring performance degradation to other domains. Thus, DFL applied two complementary branches client model, which are presented in the right part of <a href="#S0.F1" title="In Disentangled Federated Learning for Tackling Attributes Skew via Invariant Aggregation and Diversity Transferring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. These two attributes are disentangled by mutual information (MI) constraints and focused by two branches respectively. 1) Domain-specific branch is only trained locally. 2) Domain-invariant branch is applied for global aggregation. Except for redesigning the local model, the other two innovations are proposed as invariant aggregation and diversity transferring.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Invariant aggregation</span> is proposed to employ the local invariant branch for global model aggregation. The MI maximization between the local invariant branch and the global invariant model restricts clients’ optimizations in the same direction. The combination of the invariant aggregation and MI constraint drives the local invariant branch to focus on the intrinsic and causal attributes (e.g. bird itself). In the theory of  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Schölkopf et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Peters et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>, these cross-domain invariant attributes can provide transferable and reliable knowledge, which leads to proper domain adaptation and lighter catastrophic forgetting. In addition, MI minimization is employed to disentangle the invariant and specific locally. Although these domain-specific attributes are dropped out from model aggregation, they can still contribute to the final decision (e.g., things that fly in the blue sky are most likely birds). It is not wise to throw these task-correlated domain-specific attributes away directly. <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Diversity transferring</span> is proposed to make full use of these attributes, enhancing the diversity of representation. In theoretical analysis, this diversity augmentation has proved to mitigate overfitting and correct inaccurate distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Shorten &amp; Khoshgoftaar, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Specifically, the diverse representations are extracted by combining the local invariant extractor and transferred specific extractors. Thus, the local client model is forced to pay attention to these tailed attributes, which the local extractor may ignore but has a decision contribution (e.g. trees may appear in the blue-sky domain).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We emphasize that two-stage training in an alternating manner is an essential innovation because it changes the optimization purpose of FL. Compared with one-stage global optimization, alternating optimization easily finds the optimal solution of the global invariant model based on multiple local optimal points. Specifically, part of the optimization process is separated into local clients and is personalized trained. It provides both generalized adaption and personalized performance. Besides, the theoretical analysis proves that DFL is convergent even if incomplete client models participate in the global aggregation, based on the bounded gradient of the remaining model part. As far as we know, this work is the first to provide the convergence guarantee of partial aggregation. With sufficient theoretical guarantees, we design the following experiments: 1) <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Clarification experiments</span> demonstrate the unstable convergence and performance degradation with the introduction of manually synthesized attributes skew in Colored-MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Arjovsky et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>; 2) <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Verification experiments</span> verify the superiority of DFL on convergence rate and classification accuracy, compared with other SOTA personalized FL methods. In addition, the ablation study proves the complementary effectiveness of invariant aggregation and diversity transferring; 3) <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Application experiments</span> on DomainNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Peng et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>)</cite> and Office-Caltech <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gong et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> point out that DFL can adapt to the realistic attributes skew. The accuracies are all greatly improved in different backbones. The visualization on DomainNet verifies that the specific and invariant attributes can be successfully disentangled, proving the interpretability improvement by DFL.

The reason is that the domain-specific and invariant attributes are entangled and indiscriminately extracted by the single-branch local extractor. It leads to generalization problems. The MI-based disentanglement is introduced to disentangle these two attributes into two local branches, which are optimized independently. The client network is divided as representation extractors, i.e., the invariant branch <math id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E_{c}^{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml">E</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml">c</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.2">𝐸</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.3">𝑐</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.4.m4.1c">E_{c}^{k}</annotation></semantics></math> and the specific branch <math id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="E_{s}^{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.2.cmml">E</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.3.cmml">s</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.2">𝐸</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.2.3">𝑠</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.5.m5.1c">E_{s}^{k}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It should be emphasized that attribute disentanglement is leveraged to break through the limitation of one-stage global optimization of traditional FL methods. One-stage global optimization strives to find an optimal solution that simultaneously meets two conflicting objectives: generalized adaption and personalized performance. However, such efforts are usually in vain. To overcome this problem, we proposed two-stage alternating optimization. Specifically, only the invariant extraction branch of each client participates in the global model aggregation. The specific branches are optimized locally.

In summary, one-stage optimization is divided into two alternating local and global parts. The advantages are: 1) Finding the optimal global invariant aggregated model with better generalization is easier. 2) The specific branch is optimized locally, which provides personalized adaption. 3) The stability of convergence is enhanced by alternating local-global optimization.

Thus, for better specific/invariant disentanglement, parameters of the aggregated model are frozen. MI maximization drives the local invariant branch close to global aggregation, which abandons the domain-specific attributes and pays more attention to the cross-domain invariant attributes. After that, the optimal local invariant branch contributes to the global invariant aggregation.</p>

During each process, the parameters of some model parts are frozen for more targeted training. In the local process, the local invariant parameter is frozen for spinning off the specific attributes into the local specific branch, which is only optimized locally. Then, the optimal local specific and aggregated model parameters are frozen in the global process for better disentanglement of domain-invariant attributes. MI maximization drives the local invariant branch to concentrate on the decision-casual and cross-domain invariant attributes. Afterward, the optimal local invariant parameters are sent to the server for the next round of invariant aggregation. The diversity transfer is employed for representation augmentation in both two training stages.

It means that the DFL system is convergent even if only part of the extractor participates in the aggregation, based on the bounded gradient of the local specific branch. Compared with FedAvg, the convergence rate of DFL can be sped up with better optimization of local specific branches. This process is only trained locally, which reduces the entire time cost with fewer communication rounds. The other benefits of this theory are that: 1) The constraint of the client’s model consistency is relaxed, amplifying the FL application. 2) The incomplete model makes the raw data reconstruction more difficult, enhancing privacy security.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section consists of three experimental parts: clarification, verification, and application. The first part shows the complex problems caused by attributes skew in FL, which is the independent component of Non-i.i.d and exists ubiquitously. Clarification experiments clarify that attributes skew can cause unstable convergence and performance degradation. Verification experiments focus on manually synthesized attributes skew, which aims to verify the effectiveness, loss convergence, and performance improvement of DFL compared with other critical related works. Application experiments pay attention to the performance of DFL in datasets with realistic attributes skew, which tries to prove that DFL can adapt to the practical environment.</p>

Besides, the training sampling ratio in verification experiments is reduced to increase the classification difficulty. However, one thing is sure the comparisons are fair for every FL method in each experiment.
The application experiments employ two datasets: 1) <span id="S4.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Office-Caltech10</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gong et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, which contains ten overlapping classes from four domains acquired in different cameras or environments. 2) <span id="S4.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DomainNet</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Peng et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019a</a>)</cite> has 345 overlapping classes from six domains with different image styles.

With the decrease in sampling ratio, the performance damage rapid growth, which increased from less than 4% at 0.1 ratio to over 10% at 0.01 ratio. In addition, the negative transfer caused by the background color attributes skew is worse than the foreground color skew. To further explore the influence of attributes skew on the FL system, the attributes skew and label skew are mixed, which is closer to reality. The accuracy curves as (c) and (d) in <a href="#S3.F3" title="In 3.3 Convergence Analysis ‣ 3 Disentangled Federated Learning ‣ Disentangled Federated Learning for Tackling Attributes Skew via Invariant Aggregation and Diversity Transferring" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure</span> <span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> show both the performance and convergence are severely damaged in any FL methods, which even tends to be un-convergent. In summary, the stability, convergence, and performance of the FL system suffer from the introduction of attributes skew. Worse yet, this phenomenon widely exists in reality, which seriously hinders the application of FL. Thus, It is crucial to delve into and mitigate the bad influence of attributes skew.</p>

In Office-Caltech10, DFL significantly improves all categories and mean accuracy by almost 3%. For DomainNet, regardless of whether the backbone is AlexNet or ResNet101, the mean accuracy of DFL is improved. In addition, the performance of DFL is better than SingleSet training, which is only trained by the source data. It proves that DFL transfers knowledge from other domains successfully.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel FL paradigm that applies MI-based disentanglement to mitigate the negative transfer caused by distributed attributes skew. The invariant aggregation is proposed to spin off the mixed domain-specific attributes, which essentially corrects the optimization direction. The proposed diversity transferring augmented the representation in local latent space. The convergence of global aggregation using an incomplete client model expands the application scope of FL. Extensive experiments, guided by our solid convergence analysis, verify that DFL benefits FL with higher performance, better interpretability, and fewer communication rounds.</p>
