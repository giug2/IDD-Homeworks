<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In federated learning (FL), distributed clients can collaboratively train a shared global model while retaining their own training data locally.
Nevertheless, the performance of FL is often limited by the slow convergence due to poor communications links when FL is deployed over wireless networks.
Due to the scarceness of radio resources, it is crucial to select clients precisely and allocate communicaiton resource accurately for enhancing FL performance.
To address these challenges, in this paper, a joint optimization problem of client selection and resource allocation is formulated, aiming to minimize the total time consumption of each round in FL over a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled wireless network.
Specifically, considering the staleness of the local FL models, we propose an age of update (AoU) based novel client selection scheme.
Subsequently, the closed-form expressions for resource allocation are derived by monotonicity analysis and dual decomposition method.
In addition, a server-side artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to predict the FL models of clients who are not selected at each round to further improve FL performance.
Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed schemes over FL performance, average AoU and total time consumption.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, there has been a significant increase in both volume of the data traffic and a number of smart devices. The trend can be attributed to the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
This necessitates data-intensive machine learning (ML) to effectively utilize the massive amount of data for supporting intelligent services and applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
However, traditional ML relies on centralized data processing, which requires all distributed raw data (normally with large size) to be gathered for the ML training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Thus, such centralized paradigm inevitably brings heavy communication overhead and growing concerns on data privacy.
To effectively address these issues, various decentralized learning approaches including federated learning (FL) have been investigated extensively in recent years.
In comparison with centralized machine learning, FL allows edge entities, namely clients, to collaborate on training a common global model while retaining their own raw data locally <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
As a direct benefit, distributed computing resources can be effectively utilized without incurring data privacy concerns.
Specifically, clients in FL utilize the local private data to train their local FL models which they then send to the server.
Subsequently, after receiving these local models successfully, the server performs model aggregation to train a global FL model that is returned to all clients.
Through multiple rounds of learning and communication, the global FL model converges while eliminating the need to collect the private data from the involved clients.
As a result, this new approach overcomes both the data privacy concerns and high communication overhead challenge in conventional centralized ML <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Client selection plays an important role in FL, given that all clients involved will determine the overall learning performance.
Generally, the number of selected clients at different rounds of FL is limited due to communication and computing resource constraint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Most of the existing FL client selection policies are designed mainly based on threshold or probability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
However, timely model updates are crucial for the performance of FL as staleness of model update can significantly increase the convergence time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
To address this issue, the concept of age of update (AoU), is adopted as the metric to measure the elapsed time since the server received the latest update in FL and further to assist client selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Note that if the AoU value of a client is large, the degree of staleness associated with that client’s local FL model will also be large, which negatively affects the FL convergence.
In this case, the server needs to obtain timely FL training updates from clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The FL outcome can be improved by enhancing the performance of underlying wireless communication networks for reduced access latency and increased throughput.
However, this could be a challenge when the overall communication resource is insufficient.
As a result, resource-efficient channel access techniques could be very helpful in improving the performance of FL.
With the ever-increasing level of resource scarceness, it has been recognized that non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is an important enabler to enhance communication efficiency in FL systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
It has also been proved that NOMA can achieve positive effect on the decrease of AoU by improving channel access and reducing user collisions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
When integrating NOMA in FL systems, multiple clients can transmit their signals simultaneously on the same resource block, hence achieving the low level AoU of the entire FL system.
Thus, the integration of AoU and NOMA to achieve efficient resource allocation in FL is deserved to be investigated.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.ix1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Client selection in FL:
It has been shown that client selection is crucial in determining the FL performance, particularly in scenarios where there are numerous clients and limited wireless resources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Generally, FL is characterized by dynamic environments and limited network bandwidth, which makes the number of clients engaging in global FL model training at each round is limited.
Therefore, the proper selection policy is vital to achieving the desired accuracy and convergence in FL.
Current existing FL client selection policies are designed mainly based on probability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, threshold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, reputation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and so forth.
More specifically, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> selected the clients in FL via a probabilistic policy, aiming to solve the minimization problem of communication time. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the client that consumes the least amount of updating time was selected at each round by the optimal bandwidth allocation algorithm.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> presented a threshold-based client selection approach, which is designed to choose as many clients as possible who are capable of completing the local FL training within a given threshold to achieve the desired performance.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed a reputation-based client scheduling strategy, which selects the trustworthy clients based on both direct interactions and recommendations from other servers.
Nevertheless, the concept of AoU was not considered in these schemes, which plays a crucial role in determining the fast FL convergence.</p>

According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, an AoU based client scheduling policy was proposed that accounts for both the staleness of local models and the channel qualities to increase FL efficiency.

<p id="S1.I1.ix2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Resource allocation in FL:
A number of works have proposed resource allocation in FL with the goal of minimizing FL convergence time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Specifically, aiming to achieve the minimization of FL convergence time, a joint problem of client scheduling and wireless resource allocation was formulated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, to address the total FL delay minimization problem, the authors empirically studied the impacts of local computation and model compression on FL delay, communication and computing.
Besides, the resource allocation of energy efficient FL was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
In particular, with the objective of total energy consumption minimization, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> jointly considered the allocation of dataset size, transmitting power and subcarrier in FL systems.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, the problem of computational resource allocation and energy efficient transmission in FL was investigated, and the closed-form solutions were derived via an iterative algorithm.
There also are some other works investigating the global FL loss minimization problem while guaranteeing efficient resource allocation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> jointly addressed the client selection and bandwidth optimization problems for the purpose of minimizing the FL training loss.
It was proposed to use the packet error rate in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to determine the parameter transmission, followed by a joint analysis of resource allocation and client selection.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, aiming to achieve the global loss minimization, FL was deployed in a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system to jointly optimize the client selection strategy and power allocation.
However, all these works consider the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technology in their FL systems, which has limited improvement to the FL performance in resource constrained scenarios.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.ix2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When integrating NOMA technology in FL, the same resource block can be shared by multiple clients to simultaneously upload their respective local models to the server, which improves the data rate and enhances FL performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a FL system over NOMA network to realize the maximization of sum transmission rate with optimal power allocation.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, an intelligent reflecting surface aided over-the-air FL system over NOMA network was proposed.
By optimizing the reflection coefficients and transmitting power, the achievable data rate was maximized.
According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, NOMA was combined with adaptive gradient sparsification and quantization in order to accelerate FL updates in uplink channels while taking spectrum limitations into account.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From above observations, the client selection and resource allocation are two crucial factors needed to be considered jointly in determining the performance of FL, especially in resource constrained systems.
It is nessary to consider staleness of model update in FL, which significantly affect the convergence performance of FL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Therefore, AoU should be regarded as a metric for the protocol of client selection, that is, there is a tendency for the server to select clients with larger AoU for model aggregation at any FL round.
In this case, the fairness of client selection can be guaranteed, hence mitigating the overfitting risk of global FL model.
There are some current works considering AoU in FL systems with OMA transmission, while ignoring the effect of NOMA on AoU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
With NOMA in FL, more clients can be selected by the server for model aggregation at each round, hence achieving the low level AoU of the entire system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Besides, NOMA is promising to improve communciation efficiency in resource constrained scenarios, which is beneficial to facilitate the implementation of FL.
Therefore, the integration of AoU and NOMA in FL is necessary, but little research has been done in this regard.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated from above analysis, we propose an AoU based client selection and optimal resource allocation scheme to minimize the convergence time in NOMA enabled FL system.
Specifically, we formulate a joint client selection and resource allocation problem, which is a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem.
Subsequently, it is decomposed into two subproblems, including the client selection subproblem and the resource allocation subproblem.
Then, a novel AoU based client selection scheme is proposed and we obtain the closed-form expressions for resource allocation.
To make further improvement of FL performance, we propose to deploy the server-side artificial neural network (ANN) to realize the prediction of the unselected clients’ local models at every round.

Note that the number of selected clients at each round is limited to reduce the communication overhead within limited wireless communication resources.
Then, these trained local FL models will be transmitted to the server by the selected clients for model aggregation via uplink NOMA network.
After many rounds of communicating and training, the global FL model comes to convergence finally.
In this paper, it is assumed that the server is capable of providing reliable and lossless communications for downlink broadcast channels.
Thus, the communication cost for downlink transmission is negligible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.</p>

Thus, to accelerate FL convergence, we propose an AoU based client selection policy in this paper, so that the AoU of the whole system can be kept at a low level, i.e., the model update in FL is guaranteed as fresh as possible.

In our proposed FL over NOMA system, the selected clients transmit their local FL models through uplink NOMA transmission over a same channel.

Specifically, the strongest signal is first decoded by the server, while other signals are treated as interference.
When decoding is completed successfully, the server conducts the subtraction of the decoded signal from the superposition before decoding the next strongest signal.
The server continues to decode the signals until all signals have been decoded.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Problem (<a href="#S2.E9" title="In II-C Problem Formulation ‣ II System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>) is a MINLP problem, and it is difficult to solve it optimally.
In this section, to efficiently address the original formulated problem, we propose to decompose it into two subproblems, namely the client selection subproblem and the resource allocation subproblem.
More specifically, we first derive the AoU based client selection scheme according to the analysis of the convergence of global FL model.
Then, given the AoU based client selection scheme, the problem (<a href="#S2.E9" title="In II-C Problem Formulation ‣ II System Model and Problem Formulation ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>) can be transformed into a more tractable one, and the monotonicity analysis and the dual decomposition methods can be utilized to obtain the optimal closed-form solutions of the resource allocation subproblem.</p>

In this case, to achieve the minimization of global FL loss, we can minimize the expected gap instead.
Note that the first and second terms in (<a href="#S3.E16" title="In III-A Design of AoU based Client Selection ‣ III AoU based client selection and optimal resource allocation ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">16</span></a>) can be regarded as constants.
Thus, we only need to analyze the third term related to the AoU based client selection.

Because in the uplink NOMA transmission, the clients with larger channel gains need to be allocated with higher power so that the interference from other clients decoded behind them can be guaranteed to be small.
In this case, the performance of NOMA can be guaranteed.
To derive the optimal power allocation, we first analyze the problem (<a href="#S3.E20" title="In III-B Optimization of Resource Allocation ‣ III AoU based client selection and optimal resource allocation ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">20</span></a>) and then transform it to a more tractable one.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In last section, the AoU based client selection policy is proposed to achieve the minimization of total time consumption via optimal resource allocation at each FL round.
However, in practical FL scenarios with numerous clients, the client with poor communication resource will not be selected for the global model aggregation.
Among these unselected clients, some may have good local FL models, which can contribute more to the global training at the server.
To address this issue, in this section, we propose the utilization of the server-side ANN to predict the unselected clients’ local FL models at each FL round.
Note that ANN outperforms other machine learning techniques when dealing with cluttered and unstructured data, such as images, audio and text.
It is worthwhile to point out that finding a correlation between diverse clients’ local FL models belongs to a regression task, while the ANN has also demonstrated strong capabilities for function fitting tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
In this paper, using ANN, the server can aggregate more clients’ local FL models for the global FL model update, thereby reducing training loss and convergence time.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">To obtain the predicting results of the unselected clients’ local FL models at any round, the server must utilize a specific client’s local model to be the ANN input.
Hence, one client must be selected to connect with the server and the FL training performance of this client needs to be superior.
Different from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> which selects such a client during the entire FL training process, in our scheme, we propose to select this specific client adaptively.

Furthermore, Proposition 2 is able to demonstrate that both the learning accuracy and convergence time are affected by the predicting results of local FL models.
Particularly, when the prediction accuracy requirement is satisfied,
the predicting local models of unselected clients can be utilized for model aggregation, thereby enhancing the performance of the proposed ANN-based FL scheme.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are three steps for the server to make implementation of the proposed ANN-based FL scheme.
Firstly, the server needs to determine the client selection policy based on the AoU value and data size;
Secondly, the optimization algorithm should be utilized to realize the resource allocation among selected clients;
Lastly, the server must exploit ANN to predict the unselected clients’ local FL models.
More specifically, during each FL round, the server determines the selected clients according to the AoU value and the number of data samples, which is referred as the selecting weight.
Then, those selected clients send their respective local FL models to the server via uplink NOMA transmission.
The optimal resource allocation algorithm is performed by the server for each selected client.
To train the ANN which predicts the unselected clients’ local models, the server uses a specific client’s local FL model as the ANN input, which owns the highest model aggregation weight at each round.
Note that, due to the fact that this local FL model was originally used for updating the global FL model, no additional information is required for training the ANN at the server.
The details of implementation of the proposed ANN based FL scheme can be illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-B1 Convergence Analysis ‣ IV-B Analysis for ANN based FL ‣ IV Further improvement of FL performance ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this part, the superior performance of the proposed AoU based client selection (ACS) scheme in NOMA network is demonstrated via extensive simulation results.
A circular network area of radius 500 meters is considered with a server at its center serving 64 uniformly distributed clients.
We assume a resource constrained scenario, where at most 8 clients can be selected by the server at one FL round, which is far fewer than the total clients.
The random client selection (RCS) scheme in NOMA and the ACS scheme in OMA are regarded as the benchmarks for performance comparison.
More specifically, in the RCS scheme, the clients are selected by the server at a random manner at each round, which does not consider the AoU of the clients.
For the ACS scheme in OMA, the selected clients transmit their trained local FL models via OMA transmission, and the AoU of the clients are considered in this scheme.
Moreover, as a demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed ACS with optimal power allocation (ACS-OPA) scheme in NOMA, we compare it with the ACS with random power allocation (ACS-RPA) scheme in NOMA, the RCS with random power (RCS-RPA) scheme in NOMA and the ACS-OPA scheme in OMA.
Note in these schemes, the same computational resource allocation is adopted and we only consider one channel in the system.
In our simulation, the standard MNIST data set is used for the FL training.
Table I presents the simulation parameters.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of FL accuracy and global loss on independent and identically distributed (iid) data are shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, respectively.
It can be found that, with the iid data, the convergence of FL is robust, as there is an identical distribution of labels of MNIST data among all clients.
From Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we find that as FL rounds grows, the learning accuracy increases rapidly in 100 rounds and then come to the convergence gradually.
It can also be found in Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that, compared with other two schemes, our proposed ASC scheme in NOMA can achieve superior learning accuracy performance and hold at the highest learning accuracy value when it reaches the convergence.
Besides, we observe that the ACS scheme in OMA has the worst robustness, which is because in the OMA based scheme, there are fewer selected clients at each FL round compared with the NOMA based schemes.
In this case, the FL requires more training rounds so that enough local models can be utilized to achieve the convergence of FL, which is consistent with Fig. <a href="#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
Thus, the effectiveness of NOMA applied in FL can be demonstrated.
In Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, as FL rounds increase, the global FL loss decreases quickly until achieving the convergence.
From Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, we also find that the proposed ASC scheme in NOMA can achieve the lowest global FL loss compared with the other two schemes, which validates that the ASC scheme can bring performance improvement in FL systems.</p>

The generation of the non-iid data is based on the label types the clients hold.
In others words, each client in the system only holds no more than two types of labels, which is a common way to generate the non-iid data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.
Based on the observation of Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, the overall performance of FL and the robustness of FL convergence decrease a lot on non-iid data compared with that on iid data, which is determined by the property of non-iid data.
Besides, more FL rounds are required to achieve FL convergence when deploying FL on non-iid data compared with that on iid data.
Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-A Performance of FL on iid data and non-iid data ‣ V Simulation Results ‣ Joint Age-based Client Selection and Resource Allocation for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning over NOMA Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> reveal that our proposed ACS scheme in NOMA can still achieve the highest learning accuracy and the lowest global loss in comparison with the ACS scheme in OMA and the RCS scheme in NOMA.
This is because with our proposed AoU based scheme, the fairness of client selection in FL can be guaranteed, which is beneficial for the improvement of FL accuracy.
Besides, the uplink NOMA transmission in our proposed scheme allows the server to select more clients at one FL round, and hence the total data rate is increased and the performance of FL is improved.
It is also obvious to find that the ACS scheme in OMA has the lowest FL convergence rate when compared with NOMA-based schemes, which is due to the insufficient selected clients at one FL round in OMA based scheme.
Thus, the effectiveness of NOMA technology in FL can be demonstrated.</p>

Obviously, our proposed ACS scheme in NOMA can achieve the lowest average AoU during the entire process of FL training compared with other two schemes.
With the growth of FL training rounds, both the average AoU of the RCS scheme in NOMA and the ACS scheme in OMA increase gradually, while the latter has the lower average AoU compared with the former.
This is because in the ACS scheme in OMA, it also considers the AoU for the client selection, although there is a limited number of clients selected at each FL round.
Note in our simulation, the selected clients are far fewer than the total clients.
In this case, for the RCS scheme in NOMA, as the random selecting manner is adopted, the average AoU of the system cannot be guaranteed.
Nevertheless, the average AoU of our proposed ACS scheme in NOMA can always keep at a relative low value with the increase of communication rounds, i.e., the model update in FL can be guaranteed as fresh as possible, and hence the enhanced FL performance can be realized.
Besides, the fairness of the client selection in FL can also be guaranteed, which is meaningful in current large scale communication networks consisting of numerous mobile devices.</p>

We can observe that in NOMA transmission, compared with the ACS-RPA scheme and the RCS-RPA scheme, our proposed ACS-OPA scheme can achieve the least total latency during the entire FL training process.
Thus, our proposed resource allocation scheme can be demonstrated to be effective.
Besides, we find that the ACS-OPA scheme in OMA can achieve less total latency compared with the NOMA based schemes.
This is because the number of selected clients in OMA based scheme is much less than that in NOMA based schemes at each FL round, which leads to less time consumption per round under the synchronous model aggregation criteria.
Nevertheless, our proposed NOMA based scheme performs better in terms of FL training accuracy and global loss than the OMA based scheme.</p>

Note that we only consider the scenario of the ANN-based FL on non-iid data here, as it is more meaningful in practical systems, and the similar trend can be found on the iid data.
It is obvious to find that with the deployment of ANN at the server, both the performance of learning accuracy and global loss of FL can be improved.
This is because the deployed ANN allows the server to perform prediction of the local FL models of the clients who are not selected at each FL round, which equivalently increases the number of local models engaging in the model aggregation without additional wireless communication overhead.
Thus, it can be proved that it is effective to deploy ANN at the server side to make further improvement of FL performance.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed an AoU based FL system over NOMA network in this paper, where the effect of AoU on the global FL convergence was analyzed and the communication efficiency was improved via NOMA transmission.
More specifically, our objective was to achieve the minimization of total time consumption at each FL round, which includes the training time of local FL models and the uplink NOMA transmission time.
The joint client selection and resource allocation problem was formulated as a non-convex MINLP problem.
To address it efficiently, we decomposed it into two subproblems, i.e., the client selection subproblem as well as the resource allocation subproblem, and solved them iteratively until FL convergence.
Particularly, by analyzing the influence of AoU on the global FL loss, we formulated a weighted client selection problem and derived the AoU based client selecting list.
Given the AoU based client selection scheme, to obtain the optimal resource allocation, we first derived the optimal computational resource allocation based on the monotonic analysis.
Then, the dual decomposition method was utilized to derive the closed-form solution for power allocation.
To make further improvement of FL performance, we proposed the use of server-side ANN to achieve the prediction of the unselected clients’ local FL models at any round.
In this case, more local FL models can be utilized for model aggregation at the server, and hence the performance of FL can be improved without extra communication overhead.
We demonstrated the superior performance of our proposed schemes via extensive simulation results.</p>
