<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge distillation has recently become popular as a method of model aggregation on the server for federated learning. It is generally assumed that there are abundant public unlabeled data on the server. However, in reality, there exists a domain discrepancy between the datasets of the server domain and a client domain, which limits the performance of knowledge distillation. How to improve the aggregation under such a domain discrepancy setting is still an open problem. In this paper, we first analyze the generalization bound of the aggregation model produced from knowledge distillation for the client domains, and then describe two challenges, server-to-client discrepancy and client-to-client discrepancy, brought to the aggregation model by the domain discrepancies. Following our analysis, we propose an adaptive knowledge aggregation algorithm FedD3A based on domain discrepancy aware distillation to lower the bound. FedD3A performs adaptive weighting at the sample level in each round of FL. For each sample in the server domain, only the client models of its similar domains will be selected for playing the teacher role. To achieve this, we show that the discrepancy between the server-side sample and the client domain can be approximately measured using a subspace projection matrix calculated on each client without accessing its raw data. The server can thus leverage the projection matrices from multiple clients to assign weights to the corresponding teacher models for each server-side sample. We validate FedD3A on two popular cross-domain datasets and show that it outperforms the compared competitors in both cross-silo and cross-device FL settings.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Federated Learning (FL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> is proposed and achieves rapid development for the purpose of privacy protection. It allows multiple clients to conduct joint machine learning training in which the client datasets are not shared. In each round of communication, the server sends the global model (a random initialization model for the first round) to the clients. Then each client utilizes its local data to train a local model based on the global model, and the server gathers the updated local models of the clients for aggregation. The aggregated model will eventually be able to handle the data of multiple clients after going through several rounds of communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al. <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is a traditional FL algorithm that obtains the aggregated model by directly averaging the local model parameters on the server. However, parameter averaging based aggregation methods can only be applied when the local models have exactly the same structure, which limits the application scenarios of FL.
In some scenarios, such as automatic driving, the server often has a large amount of unlabeled data. Therefore, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guha, Talwalkar, and Smith <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>; Lin et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Gong et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Sturluson et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> replace parameter averaging with knowledge distillation (KD). They propose to use the public unlabeled data on the server, and leverage the ensemble output of the local models as a teacher to guide student’s (aggregated model) learning. This solution can achieve an aggregated model from heterogeneous local models, and also reduce the number of communication rounds required for federated learning, because the server’s training process can accelerate the convergence of the aggregated model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the existing work based on KD does not consider the impact of the discrepancy between different domains. As we will point out in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Proposed Method ‣ Domain Discrepancy Aware Distillation for Model Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, when there is a discrepancy between the public unlabeled data available on the server and the data in the client domains, the performance of the student (aggregated) model will drop significantly. Some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhang and Yuan <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> employ the data-free distillation by restoring pseudo samples on the server from the local models that fit the original domain data distributions. To use the data-free method in real natural images, the running mean and variance of the batch normalization layers must be obtained. However, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yin et al. <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> show that the mean and variance may leak the user’s training data. In addition, the data-free method requires a large amount of additional calculation cost. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the setting that the server has public unlabeled data. Now the problem is: how can we extract as much knowledge as possible from available unlabeled data on the server to maximize the performance of the aggregated model obtained through distillation?</p>

We find that when the teacher models (local models) originate from different domains, there are two main factors that affect the performance of the aggregated model: 1) Server-to-Client (S2C) discrepancy. When the domain discrepancy between the server domain and each client domain increases, the performance of the aggregated model on the client side will decrease. 2) Client-to-Clients (C2C) discrepancy. There is a knowledge conflict among multiple client models. Since the teacher models are learned from different client domains, the sample in the server domain is likely to obtain different predictions from different teacher models, which may severely interfere with each other. Based on these two factors, we can see that if we can reasonably take into account the similarity between the server domain and different client domains, and assign the most appropriate teacher models to different samples in the server domain, the generalization error upper bound can be reduced.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by our analysis, we propose an adaptive knowledge aggregation method, Domain Discrepancy Aware Distillation, called FedD3A. During distillation, we assign independent teacher weights to a server-side sample based on how similar this sample is to the client domains. Then we can reduce the knowledge conflict between different teacher models. In each round, the client extracts the features of the local data using the backbone of the global model, and then calculates the subspace projection matrix of the local feature space. The server obtains the projection matrices from the clients, and calculates the angles between the server data and the local feature space to measure similarity without accessing client data features.

There are several ways of applying KD in FL: 1) The first is to perform distillation on the clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yao et al. <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wu et al. <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Zhu, Hong, and Zhou <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, treating the global aggregated model as the teacher. 2) In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gong et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Sun and Lyu <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, the server and all the clients share a public unlabeled dataset. The predictions of different models on the dataset are transmitted among all parties to perform distillation. This is often used for personalized federated learning.
3) The third way is to directly use the client models as the teachers. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al. <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Guha, Talwalkar, and Smith <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> suppose the server has unlabeled data and use an ensemble of multiple client models as the teacher. The average output of the teacher model is then used to calculate the distillation loss. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Sturluson et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> proposes using the median-based scores instead of the average logits of teacher outputs for distillation. In addition, the date-free method has also been applied on the server, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Zhang and Yuan <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> try to learn a generative model based on the ensemble of client models. However, high-quality pseudo samples rely on the running mean and variance carried by BN layers in the client models, which may reveal privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yin et al. <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. The data-free method requires a large amount of computational cost, and there is no evidence that it can be applied to tasks other than image classification.
Nevertheless, data-free method is orthogonal to FedD3A, and all pseudo samples can be used as our training data.</p>

Theorem <a href="#Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ Notations and Analysis ‣ 3 Proposed Method ‣ Domain Discrepancy Aware Distillation for Model Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> implies that the error upper bound is related to three terms, from which we can summarize two major challenges for model aggregation through KD. The first challenge is related to the second term, that is server-to-client (S2C) discrepancy. When the difference between server domain data and client domain data is large, the risk upper bound will also increase. This domain discrepancy can naturally be reduced if we can access the client domain data and perform data augmentation through image mixing. Unfortunately, in the context of federated learning, we cannot obtain client data. The second challenge is related to the third term, we call it client-to-clients (C2C) discrepancy, that is, the difference between a single client and all clients. In the extreme case that we have only one client <math id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(\mathcal{T}_{1},f_{1})" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.3" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">(</mo><msub id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">𝒯</mi><mn id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml">f</mi><mn id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.5" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2b"><interval closure="open" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2"><apply id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">𝒯</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2">𝑓</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3">1</cn></apply></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SSx1.p4.1.m1.2c">(\mathcal{T}_{1},f_{1})</annotation></semantics></math>, the third term becomes:</p>

This special setting has been studied in FedAws <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yu et al. <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. FedAws performs multiple rounds of federated training to jointly learn a classifier when each client has only one class of data. However, if FedAws is adopted, an additional auxiliary FL task for domain classification has to be introduced before the main FL task, which greatly increases the communication cost and computational overhead. Therefore, below we propose a lightweight approach based on subspace projection to implement <math id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\text{dom}(\cdot)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1a"><mrow id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.cmml"><mtext id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.2" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.2a.cmml">dom</mtext><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.1" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml">⋅</mo><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1b"><apply id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2"><times id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.1"></times><ci id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.2a.cmml" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.2"><mtext id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.2.2">dom</mtext></ci><ci id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1.1">⋅</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SSx2.p2.5.m5.1c">\text{dom}(\cdot)</annotation></semantics></math>.

After obtaining the projection matrix, the client uses the local dataset to train the local model. When the global model and the local model are homogeneous, the local model is initialized with the global model parameters. When the global model and the local model are heterogeneous, the global model and the local models have different structures. The client needs to use the global model as a teacher for training, that is, using the cross entropy loss and a distillation loss to guide the local model training at the same time. In the experimental part, we will show the effectiveness of FedD3A under both the homogeneous and heterogeneous setting.</p>

Our method only needs to exchange model parameters and projection matrices, without sharing the raw client-side datasets or features. Compared with the operation of directly transmitting the running mean images or the features extracted from the backbone in some works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Peng et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019b</a>; Yoon et al. <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, the projection matrix can avoid directly further disclosing the user data features. It is also worth noting that, in the proposed method, it is not required to transmit the mean and variance in the BN layers of local models. Therefore the risk of restoring raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yin et al. <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> can be avoided.</p>

Knowledge distillation based model aggregation methods only involve the outputs of the local models, thus allowing local models to have different structures. In this paper, we focus on the following heterogeneous model aggregation scenario: the clients have different model structures, the server aggregates these models into a public model structure. After the aggregated model is sent to the clients, each client uses KD for knowledge transfer. Ultimately, the server can obtain the global model while the clients retain their personalized models.</p>

It can be seen that: 1) In FedD3A, the mean accuracy of all clients is slightly improved compared with the original results and this improvement mainly comes from the <span id="S4.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clipart</span> domain. The performance of the other four domains has hardly changed. This is because the server data coincides with the first client (<span id="S4.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clipart</span>), so that the student can learn more from the teacher corresponding to that client. 2) In FedDF, all domains have a slight decrease.</p>

It can be seen that non-IID has a great impact on the performance of model averaging. 2) Compared with FedAvg, FedProx has a significant improvement, but its performance is still inferior to that of the distillation based method FedDF. While in the cross-silo experiment, FedDF is worse than FedProx. This indicates that the distillation based method is more effective when the clients are extreme non-IID.
3) In general, our FedD3A clearly outperforms other competitors with higher convergence speed and higher accuracy.</p>

For cross-device setting, five clients within each domain use the same kind of model. We take ResNet50 as the global model. In each round, the clients take the global model as a teacher, and then trains its own local model by cross-entropy loss and distillation loss (KL divergence). The server uses the heterogeneous models uploaded by the clients for multi-teacher distillation to obtain the global model.

It can be seen that random weighting is close to the average strategy, both of which have lower accuracy. In contrast, our FedD3A method has an obvious performance improvement. This shows that it is very important to carry out adaptive knowledge filtering for teacher models. In addition, FedD3A-soft is better than FedD3A-onehot, which implies that onehot strategy may ignore the overlapping knowledge among local models.</p>

<p id="S4.p12.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.p12.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Classification Ability of Subspace Projection.</span> In the above experiments, we verify the effectiveness of FedD3A in the FL context. One remaining problem is that, based on subspace projection, can we really judge which domain the test image comes from? To intuitively verify this, we design the following experiments. We divide the dataset according to category, and each client has one class. For example, the training set of CIFAR100 is divided into 100 clients according to category, and the client index is consistent with the class label. By uploading the subspace projection matrices, we try to classify the test set in the server <span id="S4.p12.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">with only one round</span>. In this experiment, each category can be regarded as a domain, there is no need to consider cross-domain datasets. Therefore, we add several more common datasets in addition to Digit-5 and DomainNet. The backbone is a 3-layer MLP for MNIST, and a ResNet18 for CIFAR10/100, a ResNet50 for the other datasets. In this experiment, we take the prototype-based method as a baseline, in which, each client upload the mean feature as the class prototype. The server calculates which prototype the feature of the test image is most similar to. We take three random seeds and average the results. See Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Domain Discrepancy Aware Distillation for Model Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the projection-based method does not need to upload the raw features, and achieves better test accuracy.</p>

It can be seen that: 1) Compared with the baseline method, FedD3A can learn better feature representations that are more conducive to classification. On the contrary, the features learned by FedAvg are greatly affected by domain discrepancy. 2) Domain information can be distinguished from the extracted features. In the same cluster, data from different domains are not mixed, which indicates that the subspace projection can be used to distinguish data domains.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we explore the data domain discrepancy issue faced when leveraging server unlabeled data for model aggregation in federated learning. We show that the generalization error upper bound of the aggregation model on the clients can be reduced by assigning appropriate teacher weights to the unlabeled data on the server. Based on our analysis, we propose a domain discrepancy aware knowledge distillation algorithm FedD3A. Experimental results show that FedD3A outperforms the baseline methods in both cross-silo and cross-device FL settings, and heterogeneous model aggregation scenarios. Moreover, The experiments also verify that the adaptive filtering of teacher knowledge is very important to improve the performance of the aggregated model, which validate the claims in the contributions in Section <a href="#S1" title="1 Introduction ‣ Domain Discrepancy Aware Distillation for Model Aggregation in Federated Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>
