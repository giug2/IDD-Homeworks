<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning (FL) requires edge devices to perform local training and exchange information with a parameter server, leading to substantial energy consumption. A critical challenge in practical FL systems is the rapid energy depletion of battery-limited edge devices, which curtails their operational lifespan and affects the learning performance.
To address this issue, we apply energy harvesting technique in FL systems to extract ambient energy for continuously powering edge devices.
We first establish the convergence bound for the wireless FL system with energy harvesting devices, illustrating that the convergence is impacted by partial device participation and packet drops, both of which depend on the energy supply.
To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP).
By solving this MDP, we derive the optimal transmission policy and demonstrate that it possesses a monotone structure with respect to the battery and channel states.
To overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential complexity of computing the optimal policy, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases.
Furthermore, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are presented to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Machine learning is a cornerstone technology driving artificial intelligence (AI) in diverse fields, such as autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and the Internet of Things <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Traditional centralized machine learning requires the aggregation and processing of distributed data on a central server, which leads to increased data traffic and raises concerns about data privacy and security.
To address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without uploading raw data to a central server<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
In FL, edge devices (e.g., mobile phones and sensors) conduct local training on their respective datasets and subsequently exchange information (e.g., model parameters or gradients) with a parameter server.
Due to its distinctive architecture, FL can alleviate the computation and communication burdens and preserve the data privacy of involved edge devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In practical scenarios, the performance of FL is severely affected by radio resources, such as transmission power and bandwidth.
The limited radio resources among participating edge devices hinder data transmission and increase communication latency, degrading the learning performance.
To tackle these issues, numerous papers have investigated communication resource management for wireless FL systems.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, the authors investigated a joint radio resource allocation and user selection problem for wireless FL, aiming to minimize the training loss under delay and energy consumption constraints. A similar resource allocation problem of achieving the optimal tradeoff between convergence speed and power consumption for wireless FL was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors developed a joint computation and transmission scheme for wireless FL under a more challenging setting with heterogeneous data.
While the aforementioned studies explored static resource allocation according to the statistical properties of wireless channels, other research focused on the dynamic allocation of communication resources.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a dynamic power control policy based on instant channel state information (CSI) to speed up the convergence of over-the-air FL. Similarly, a dynamic device scheduling and power control scheme for over-the-air FL was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Bandwidth allocation for wireless FL has also been studied extensively.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, the authors investigated a joint device selection and bandwidth allocation problem for wireless FL, devising an online algorithm to maximize the number of participating devices in each round. A similar problem incorporating latency constraints was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> studied a joint power and bandwidth allocation problem to simultaneously minimize the power consumption, computation cost, and time cost of wireless FL systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the extensive research, all the aforementioned studies have either considered finite energy supply for edge devices or completely neglected the energy limitations.
However, merely utilizing the finite energy stored in the batteries of edge devices will lead to a reduced operational lifespan. Once the battery is depleted, edge devices cannot contribute to the training process of FL, which degrades the learning performance.
Additionally, frequent battery replacements and recharges are impractical, especially for devices deployed in remote or inaccessible environments.
To address this issue, energy harvesting (EH) FL has emerged as a promising solution. This technique collects ambient energy (e.g., solar, wind or thermoelectric energy) to continuously power edge devices, thereby extending their operational lifetime and improving the learning performance.
Furthermore, EH FL uses clean and renewable energy sources, making it more environmentally friendly compared to conventional FL with battery-powered edge devices.
Several recent studies have investigated EH FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, a client scheduling algorithm was introduced to accelerate the convergence of FL over EH-enabled wireless networks.
A joint device selection and resource allocation problem was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to reduce training latency and improve the data utility of EH FL. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> extended this problem to a more sophisticated system, where the server employs massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to serve clients.
Exploiting the over-the-air computation, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a bandwidth-efficient scheme for joint client selection and energy management in EH FL.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a joint client selection and bandwidth allocation scheme was designed for FL with EH devices, aiming to minimize the ages of local models and the latency of global iterations.
To accelerate the convergence of EH FL, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> formulated a joint transceiver design and device scheduling problem and developed a Lyapunov-based online optimization algorithm to solve it.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The prior works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> on EH FL concentrate on designing transmission strategies for one typical time slot.
However, the overall performance of FL is affected by the cumulative model aggregation errors over the entire training period, necessitating careful utilization of harvested energy from a long-term perspective.
We note that <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> is an early attempt to optimize the long-term efficiency of EH FL.
However, its online optimization algorithm fails to exploit the statistical knowledge of system dynamics, e.g., the distributions of the channel gains and the amount of harvested energy, resulting in suboptimal learning performance.
Thus, in this paper, we are motivated to develop a Markov decision process (MDP) framework for designing the optimal transmission policy of EH FL.
The proposed MDP framework utilizes the statistical knowledge of channels and harvested energy to address their inherent stochastic nature, thereby enabling efficient utilization of harvested energy and enhanced learning performance.
The main contributions are summarized as follows.</p>

Specifically, the convergence rate of wireless FL can be improved by scheduling more devices and increasing their transmission power.
However, in practical scenarios, both device scheduling and transmission power are constrained by the battery energy level.
Thus, the transmission policy should be carefully designed to utilize the limited and uncertain harvested energy effectively.</span></p>

Moreover, we ignore the first term on the RHS of (<a href="#S3.E17" title="In Theorem 1. ‣ III-A Convergence Analysis ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning With Energy Harvesting Devices: An MDP Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">17</span></a>) since it only relates to the initial error and converges to zero as <math id="S3.SS2.p1.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml">T</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.5.m5.1.1">𝑇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.5.m5.1c">T</annotation></semantics></math> increases.

Constraint C1 corresponds to the bandwidth constraint, while constraint C2 is the energy causality constraint.
We remark that instead of adopting heuristic performance metrics (e.g., energy consumption and the number of scheduled devices), we provide a more reasonable objective function based on the convergence bound derived in Theorem <a href="#Thmthm1" title="Theorem 1. ‣ III-A Convergence Analysis ‣ III Convergence Analysis and Problem Formulation ‣ Federated Learning With Energy Harvesting Devices: An MDP Framework" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

The benefits for the monotone structure are twofold. First, it reduces the storage space for online implementation, as only the boundary states used for switching transmission power need to be stored. Second, the monotone structure can reduce the computational overhead for solving the Bellman equation.
According to the monotone structure, the standard value iteration algorithm can be modified as follows.

However, this information may be unknown a priori in practice (e.g., edge devices are deployed in unknown or time-varying environments).
To address this challenge, the DQN algorithm has been widely adopted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
DQN is an extension of the Q-learning algorithm, which uses a state-action value function, known as the Q-function, to estimate the quality of state-action pairs.

As observed, the proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal learning performance and outperform other benchmarks.
The greedy optimality gap minimization scheme myopically uses up all remaining energy at each time slot, leading to poor performance in subsequent time slots.
The Lyapunov-based online optimization scheme does not utilize the statistical knowledge of system dynamics, e.g., the distributions of the channel gains and the amount of harvested energy, resulting in poor long-term performance.
In contrast, the proposed algorithms leverage the previously known or learned knowledge of channel and energy dynamics to design the transmission policy from a long-term perspective, thereby improving the learning performance.</p>

As can be observed, our proposed algorithms exhibit considerable performance improvements under different battery capacities.
For all schemes, the test accuracy increases with battery capacity, since smaller capacities lead to quicker saturation and potential waste of harvested energy.
However, once the battery capacity exceeds 9, the accuracy of other benchmarks plateaus, whereas the proposed algorithms continue to exhibit improvement. This divergence can be attributed to the benchmarks’ neglect of battery capacity limitations in their algorithm design.
In contrast, the proposed algorithms leverage increased battery capacity to improve state representation and decision-making flexibility, thereby enhancing the learning performance.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have studied FL with EH devices.
We have conducted convergence analysis to demonstrate the influence of transmission policy on the learning performance.
Based on the convergence bound, we have formulated a joint device scheduling and power control problem to minimize the optimality gap under energy and bandwidth constraints.
We have further modeled this optimization problem as an MDP and demonstrated that its optimal policy possesses a monotone structure.
We have also proposed a low-complexity relax-and-truncate algorithm that is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases.
Moreover, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we have developed an SE-DQN algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance. Finally, extensive numerical experiments have been presented to validate the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p>
