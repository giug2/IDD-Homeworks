<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">With growing concerns regarding data privacy and rapid increase in data volume, Federated Learning (FL) has become an important learning paradigm. However, jointly learning a deep neural network model in a FL setting proves to be a non-trivial task because of the complexities associated with the neural networks, such as varied architectures across clients, permutation invariance of the neurons, and presence of non-linear transformations in each layer. This work introduces a novel framework, <em id="id4.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated Heterogeneous Neural Networks</em> (FedHeNN), that allows each client to build a personalised model without enforcing a common architecture across clients. This allows each client to optimize with respect to local data and compute constraints, while still benefiting from the learnings of other (potentially more powerful) clients. The key idea of FedHeNN is to use the instance-level representations obtained from peer clients to guide the simultaneous training on each client. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the FedHeNN framework is capable of learning better performing models on clients in both the settings of homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures across clients.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed machine learning has been an important field of study for long and is becoming more and more important with time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Park &amp; Kargupta, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>. Federated Learning is a type of distributed machine learning setting that consists of many end devices or silo organisations (<span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clients</span>) which have access to the data stored locally and a global server which can orchestrate the learning without accessing all the data. With the ever so rapidly growing amount of data and the concerns around data privacy, federated learning has emerged as a very promising direction, as it allows learning of a global model using the data present at each client but without explicitly sharing the data outside the client devices, thus helping in ensuring data privacy and also reducing the cost of centralised training and storage.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> is the de-facto federated learning algorithm where each client performs SGD steps towards training its local model using its own data and compute resources. The client models are then periodically shared with the server and the server aggregates the client models to create a global model which is sent back to the clients. However, the solution obtained from FedAvg has been shown to diverge in presence of statistical heterogeneity across clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. Over the years several modifications have been proposed to the original algorithm addressing different aspects like data heterogeneity, availability of clients for training, modifying the aggregation mechanism, optimizing communication costs, personalised client models etc. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Eichner et al., <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Smith et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017a</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Collins et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>. In all of these methods the global model parameters are obtained by appropriately aggregating the local model parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Yet in most practical settings where the clients are heterogeneous and differ a lot in their compute resources and data distributions, these methods may face significant challenges. Several real-world FL scenarios require training over end devices which have very different hardware. In such cases, for the above methods, the clients that are incapable of training large models will never be able to take part in the training process. Similarly, if the common model architecture is kept small to accommodate all the clients, some clients will be under-utilised. These negative effects might become more prominent in the cross-silo FL setting where the total number of clients is even smaller (typically less than 100). An illustrative experiment shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Architecture Agnostic Federated Learning for Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> demonstrates the drop in accuracy of the global methods like FedAvg and FedProx when a few clients are left out of the training.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a systematic framework for architecture agnostic federated learning called FedHeNN. This framework is able to overcome the aforementioned challenges of client heterogeneity by allowing each client to build a personalised model without any constraint on the model architecture including number and size of the hidden layers, activation functions, etc. The learning across clients is transferred by grounding the representations being learnt at each client through a proximal term. Specifically, the optimisation objective at each client comprises of two terms - the task loss, and a proximal term that pulls the final learned representations of the models together. This also makes the neural networks learn more robust representations on a wide range of data leading to better performance. We test our framework on a suite of federated learning datasets in both the settings of homogeneous and heterogeneous model architectures across clients.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed learning algorithms were extensively studied in the data mining community in the early 2000s under topics such as distributed (and privacy preserving) data mining <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lindell &amp; Pinkas, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Merugu &amp; Ghosh, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">Nov, 2003</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Merugu &amp; Ghosh, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Park &amp; Kargupta, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ghosh &amp; Tumer, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>)</cite>. This topic was re-framed as <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_inline-quote ltx_outerquote">“Federated Learning”</span> in an influential paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> that introduced the FedAvg algorithm, and has rapidly gained new adherents since then.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The framework proposed by FedAvg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(McMahan et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> has been the standard solution for Federated Learning since 2017. However when the data across clients is non-iid, averaging the local optima of the multiple clients to obtain the global solution may lead to divergence in the optimization. To solve this, FedProx <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> proposes to modify the local training objective by adding a proximal term which penalizes the distance between the current global model weights and the local model weights thus preventing each local update from moving far away. Similarly, SCAFFOLD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Karimireddy et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> introduces control-variates to correct the local updates. FedPD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, FedSplit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pathak &amp; Wainwright, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and FedDyn <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Acar et al., <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> are other important works that study the problem of finding better fixed points.</p>

FedBE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chen &amp; Chao, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> also provides evidence that the best performing aggregate model need not necessarily be the average of the local models. Another important aspect of Federated Learning is thus to appropriately aggregate the local models. PFNM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yurochkin et al., <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and FedMA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite> show that neurons in each layer are permutation invariant and these works perform a layer by layer matching of neurons and then aggregate of the matched neurons.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Singh &amp; Jaggi, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> use an Optimal-Transport based distance to perform the matching of neurons before aggregation. Different from above, FedDF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> uses additional data samples to distill knowledge from clients’ local models.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.5" class="ltx_p">While this aggregation mechanism is shown to have good empirical results, this method of learning involving element-wise averaging might give sub-optimal results because of various reasons like permutation invariance property of the neurons, different data distributions across clients etc. Besides, FedAvg imposes a hard constraint on clients to train the models with the exact same architectures. In practice, it is highly likely that different clients may not be able to train the models of same capacity.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Our framework allows one to perform federated learning across heterogeneous clients by collecting and aggregating the representations learnt on the local clients and pulling those representations closer. The framework is inspired by the same intuition that there is an underlying lower dimensional representation of the data that the clients can together uncover. To achieve this, we let each client train its own model but pull the representations learnt by different clients closer by adding a proximal term to the client’s loss function. The proximal term measures the distance between the representations learnt by different local models.

CKA was originally proposed to compare the representations obtained from different neural networks to determine equivalence relationships between hidden layers of neural networks.

Moreover, because CKA is a kernel based metric it provides a way to compare the representations obtained from networks of different widths thus providing greater flexibility for heterogeneous settings. The kernel based metric is able to characterize the representation space via the pairwise similarity between instances and thus helps in diminishing the effects of permutation invariance. CKA is also shown to be invariant to changes in initializations of the network. Because of all these properties, CKA extends itself naturally for use as a distance metric in our method.</p>

For the image classification task, we use CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets that contain colored images in 10 and 100 classes respectively. And for the text classification task we use a binary classification dataset called Sentiment140. We partition the entire data to generate non-iid samples on each client and then split those into training and test sets at the client site.</p>

The FedAvg and FedProx algorithms learn a centralised global model thus the reported performance metric is of the global model. On the contrary, the FedRep method learns personalised models for each client. Therefore, FedRep’s performance is reported for the personalised models. For FedHeNN, we report the performance of local models for both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings and that of the global model for the homogeneous setting. As for FedProto, it is demonstrated in the paper that the performance gap between FedProto and FedAvg decreases when we have more samples per class. In our settings, since we do not restrict the number of samples per class and also beat the FedAvg algorithm by a significant margin, we do not directly compare with FedProto.</p>

For global models the test accuracy is computed by evaluating the global model on the local test datasets and for the local models test accuracy is computed by testing personalised models on the local test datasets. For
hyperparameter tuning of methods, we utilise a global val-
idation dataset which is not shared with any of the clients.</p>

We also vary this number of classes to change the heterogeneity level across clients. The robustness and scalabality of our method is tested by increasing the number of clients participating in training from 100 to 500 for CIFAR-10 dataset.

In FedAvg, increasing the number of local epochs has an adverse effect on the performance of the model. On the other hand, no such effect was observed for FedHeNN owing to the presence of the proximal term. We keep the number of local epochs for FedHeNN to be as high as 20.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sensitivity to Changing Amount of Data</span> We have empirically shown that FedHeNN is able to accommodate the clients with lower compute resources in an effective way. In order to show that the FedHeNN can also work with the clients with smaller data footprint, we do an experiment in which we randomly take a fraction of clients and reduce the data on those clients by 50%. We show the results of the experiment in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Architecture Agnostic Federated Learning for Neural Networks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> where x-axis has the fraction of clients picked for shrinking the data and y-axis is the average test accuracy of all clients obtained when the framework is trained on the reduced dataset. We notice that even with the decreasing data size on the clients’ ends FedHeNN is able to maintain graceful performance. This effect could be attributed to the fact that even though the number of instances to train the prediction function is reduced, the representation learning component is still robust.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a new method for enhancing learning in Federated Learning by introducing a systematic framework called FedHeNN. The FedHeNN framework is unique because it allows the clients with heterogeneous architectures to participate in the joint learning process helping boost the performance. This could be a huge practical advancement as now the individual client devices or organisations with variable amount of resources can equally contribute and learn from each other. The empirical results indicate that FedHeNN is able to achieve better performing results while also being more inclusive. For future work, we would work on determining the solution characteristics and the convergence guarantees of both the FedHeNN algorithms. There are a few natural research directions arising from this work. First, it is of interest to extend the FedHeNN to the Transformer architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Vaswani et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Nguyen et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">b</a>)</cite>. Second, we can use generative models to generate the RAD, the data being used for aligning representations to relax the assumption of presence of additional data on the server.</p>
