<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p"><em id="id2.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Federated learning</em> is a distributed learning technique where machine learning models are trained on client devices in which the local training data resides. The training is coordinated via a central server which is, typically, controlled by the intended owner of the resulting model. By avoiding the need to transport the training data to the central server, federated learning improves privacy and efficiency. But it raises the risk of <em id="id2.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">model theft</em> by clients because the resulting model is available on every client device. Even if the application software used for local training may attempt to prevent direct access to the model, a malicious client may bypass any such restrictions by reverse engineering the application software. <em id="id2.2.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Watermarking</em> is a well-known deterrence method against model theft by providing the means for model owners to demonstrate ownership of their models. Several recent deep neural network (DNN) watermarking techniques use <em id="id2.2.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">backdooring</em>: training the models with additional mislabeled data. Backdooring requires full access to the training data and control of the training process. This is feasible when a single party trains the model in a centralized manner, but not in a federated learning setting where the training process and training data are distributed among several client devices. In this paper, we present <span id="id2.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">Waffle</span>, the first approach to watermark DNN models trained using federated learning. It introduces a re-training step at the server after each aggregation of local models into the global model.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distributed machine learning has gained considerable attention in many big data processing applications such as recommendation systems, smart assistants, and health-care, due to its efficient parallelization and scalability properties. Federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> is an instance of privacy-preserving distributed machine learning that allows decentralized training of deep neural networks (DNNs) by many parties holding local data samples. Major companies have already utilized federated learning in various large-scale applications such as improving the Google Keyboard (Gboard) suggestions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> or Apple’s voice recognition models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In these applications, clients only need to download a set of tools or a specific software (e.g., Tensorflow Lite<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>ML for Mobile and Edge Devices, https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/</span></span></span>) into their mobile devices, and execute the training with the on-device, cached data. Hence, instead of using publicly available or synthetic datasets that often do not represent the real-world distribution, model owners can deploy high-quality models with no access to the possibly sensitive training data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The most common federated learning setting in commercial, global-scale applications is <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">client-server</span> involving three parties: <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model owner</span>, <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aggregator</span> (hosted on a server), and a large number of <span id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clients</span> training a common <span id="S1.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global model</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Federated learning consists of iterative <span id="S1.p2.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aggregation rounds</span> where (1) the aggregator sends the global model parameters to clients, (2) each client replaces parameters of its local model using the global model, re-trains it using the on-device data, and sends updated parameters back to the aggregator, which (3) combines them into a new global model. The final global model is delivered to the model owner when the training is completed. Since each client’s training data stays in place, federated learning preserves privacy of clients’ data and avoids incurring substantial costs for transferring training data from clients to a centralized trainer.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its advantages, federated learning brings forth the issue of preserving ownership. In large-scale, client-server federated learning applications, there are multiple clients who are data-owners and <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">can use the model</em> in their local devices, but there is <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">only one model owner.</em>
However, a side-effect of the training process is that each client can gain complete access to the global model in every round, including the final one by reverse engineering the application software <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or on-device dynamic analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Although the model owner can deploy further mechanisms for hiding model parameters during the local training (e.g. homomorphic encryption), this might lead to high latency, bandwidth costs, and additional requirements for benign clients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. It is therefore useful to have a means of demonstrating the intended ownership in case a malicious client uses the global model residing on their devices in unauthorized ways such as monetizing the model or making it available to their own customers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, different watermarking techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> have been proposed to demonstrate ownership of DNN models. In a typical backdoor-based watermarking procedure, the model owner first designs a secret <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">watermark</em> which consists of mislabeled input output pairs. Then, the model owner trains the model with both the training dataset and the watermark in order to embed the watermark into the model. This watermark can be subsequently used to demonstrate ownership.
However, existing DNN watermarking solutions cannot be directly applied in federated learning for two reasons.
First, model owners cannot use techniques for generating watermarks using training data because they lack access to the training data (e.g., Gboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>). Second, training is performed in parallel by several clients, some of them being potentially malicious. Although some “trusted clients” can join the watermark embedding phase, the training setup and aggregation rules have to be changed to handle them differently. Thus, watermark embedding cannot be implemented easily by clients.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our goal is to design a procedure for effectively embedding watermarks into DNN models trained via client-server federated learning, without decreasing the accuracy of the resulting global model while minimizing the computational and communication overhead imposed on the distributed training process.

A <span id="S2.SS2.p2.12.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">backdoor</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> consists of a <span id="S2.SS2.p2.12.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">trigger set</span> of samples with incorrect labels. In computer vision, a trigger set usually contains specific patterns that can be added to an image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> or a set of images unrelated to the actual task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, both of which serve a similar purpose. The backdoor is injected into a DNN by training it with both the correct training data and the backdoor. At inference time, the backdoored DNN performs normally on clean inputs but returns the expected incorrect label when a sample from the trigger set is given as an input.

For evaluating the robustness, we use three state-of-the-art defenses against backdooring.
Fine-tuning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> are generic watermark removal techniques that do not require knowledge of the trigger pattern or the watermarking method. Both techniques utilize some clean dataset (e.g., subset of a training set) and re-train the model in order to remove the watermark.
Neural Cleanse <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> is a technique to detect, reverse-engineer and subsequently remove potential backdoors from DNN models, and it can be used for watermark removal. To evaluate these techniques, we set the acceptable utility drop of 5 percentage point (pp): the watermark must be removed while keeping the test accuracy degradation less than 5pp.</p>

While Neural Cleanse requires only 10% malicious clients to be successful against the CIFAR10 model, adversaries would have to share their datasets and collaborate with each other to recover the triggers.
The collaboration between adversaries in a distributed attack is different from a sybil attack in our case. Creating multiple identities does not improve removal and evasion attacks since the performance of these attacks is directly related to the quantity and the diversity of data held by the adversary.
Collaboration is impractical since adversaries need to reveal their highly-sensitive dataset to other untrustworthy parties.
We also empirically evaluated that watermark removal attacks fail to decrease watermark accuracy or recover test accuracy, if performed in a federated learning setup without sharing their datasets. On the other hand, if an adversary holds more than 10% of the whole training data, it could successfully remove watermarks from <math id="S7.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="w_{adv}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p2.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">w</mi><mrow id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">a</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">d</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1a" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.4" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml">v</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑤</ci><apply id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑎</ci><ci id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑑</ci><ci id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.4">𝑣</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1c">w_{adv}</annotation></semantics></math> without decreasing the model performance.

We will also explore how malicious clients can try to recover and degrade watermarks <span id="S7.p6.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">during</span> the training phase of the federated learning and provide detection/mitigation techniques against these adversaries.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Watermarking DNNs for ownership verification was first proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> by using backdooring techniques. Deepmarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> presents a collusion-secure watermarking method that encodes watermarks into the probability density function of weights using a specific regularization loss during the training phase. However, these techniques require direct access to model weights (white-box access) for ownership verification. DeepSigns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is the first watermarking method applicable with both white-box and black-box access, and it embeds watermarks to the activation maps of selected layers. DeepIPR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> proposes a passport-based DNN ownership verification scheme
that tries to embed watermarks into a special passport layer of DNNs. Although DeepIPR is robust against watermark removal attacks, it is expensive and imposes a significant computational cost. A zero-bit watermarking algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> embeds watermarks into models, that are stolen via black-box methods, by leveraging adversarial perturbations. Although this approach is feasible, it heavily depends on adversarial examples and their transferability property across different models.
Authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> propose a blind-watermark based approach that inserts a specifically designed logo into the original sample via encoder such that the resulting sample is almost indistinguishable from the original one. All these proposals require full control of the training process and cannot be applied in federated learning.</p>

<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Federated learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that alters the training and inference phase of the system. Poisoning attacks are first introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, where a malicious client trains its local model on the backdoor and attempts to replace the global model with the poisoned model. Another powerful attack is model update poisoning attacks, where the adversary aims to prevent the global model from converging to a desirable state by sending poisoned model updates to the server <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> states that clients might suffer Byzantine failures, which leads to arbitrary behavior across communication rounds affecting the convergence of the global model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Client-server federated learning also suffers from privacy leakage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. For example, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, a malicious client can learn about class representatives of other clients’ training data by using generative adversarial networks. Attackers in client-server federated learning implement passive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> and active <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> membership inference attacks in order to detect whether a sample belongs to the overall training set or a specific client. In passive attacks, the attacker could be the aggregator that can only observe individual model updates. In active attacks, malicious clients try to influence the global model in order to extract more information about other clients’ training dataset. There have been a few attempts to prevent the privacy leakage applying differential privacy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> or using trusted execution environments in clients’ devices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. However, these methods trade-off either computational overhead or performance for privacy.</p>

<p id="A1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A1.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Embedded Content</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> takes a subset of the training data and modifies samples of this subset by adding a meaningful content (e.g., logo, text, a specifically designed pattern) into them. While original samples are labeled correctly, modified samples have incorrect labels that are pre-defined by the model owner. We construct Embedded Content by randomly selecting 10 images from the training data for each class, 100 images in total. We modify these images by adding a specifically designed pattern to them and assign incorrect labels to this modified set. We emphasize that Embedded Content requires training data knowledge, so it is not a suitable method for watermarking large-scale federated learning models. Nevertheless, we compare <span id="A1.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">WafflePattern</span> to Embedded Content, since it is proved to be a robust watermark <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> against post-processing techniques. <span id="A1.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">unRelate</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> is either designed as unstructured abstract images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or as structured images from another data distribution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, both of which are unrelated to the original task. These images are labeled with classes from the original task. For example, if the task is face recognition, the model owner might use different handwriting images to construct the watermark. We construct unRelate by randomly sampling 100 images from the ImageNet dataset which are unrelated to CIFAR10 and MNIST <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. <span id="A1.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">unStruct</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> generates a random watermark set and adds it into different layers of DNN models. In order to imitate unStruct, we produce watermark samples with purely Gaussian noise as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. In both unRelate and unStruct, 10 classes are assigned to randomly selected 10 images, 100 in total.</p>
